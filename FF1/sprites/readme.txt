
FF1 Sprites
-----------

These sprites were made by me, Brian Carper, as part of my FF1 site http://www.classicgaming.com/ff1.  I don't care if you use the sprite for your own purposes or distribute this file, just so long as this text file stays in the .zip, and I get credit for making them.  (Linking to my site would do just fine.)   These sprites are copyright Squaresoft, most likely.

Enjoy.
