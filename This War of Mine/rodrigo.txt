Trading
-------
- Franko trades 1:1 (and Katia has bonus), other traders do 5/6(~83%):1 (so Katia is 1:1)


PS4 Changes
-----------
- In PC, it was possible to make a profit using Katia, thus cleaning up his inventory. In PS4 this exploit was fixed:
	if Katia on group, Franko is 1:1 with her and 5/6:1 with everyone else
	However, Franko charges her only 1.5 for Wood in day 3 even in Winter

- Always buy ALL (or most) of:
	Eletrical (very rare)
	Weapon Parts (needed a lot specially late-game)
	Parts (scarce in beginning)
	Components (used for everything, mid-game it almost dissappers, non-renewable)
	Filters (to save on Components)
	Water (as Components, it dissapears mid-game and is needed a lot, requires Fiters (Components) to craft)
	Wood (small stack size and poor value makes it a poor choice to bring from scavenging)
	Fuel (to save on Wood)
	Vegetable (reneawable only in mid-game, and in practice always scarce)

- Cigarrete crafting usually not worth the profit, Moonshine (13.5 - 9 = 4.5) usually not worth the hassle
- Pure Alcohol profit is the same (in absolute value) as Moonshine

- Bruno is AMAZING... for crafting MEDICATION (Pills)! Uses a single part, so double outcome.

- Never sell looted ingredients (med, herbs, etc): craft stuff with them (Cigs) and sell for marginal profit.
	Except Weapons/Armor: Weapon Parts are rare, profit is low: 0.5 Ammo, 1.5 Pistol, 2.0 Shortgun, 2.5 Helmet, 3.5 Vest, 4.5 Assault Rifle
	Specially for Ammunition: Never craft Ammo, sell parts instead!
	Also avoid crafting if it requires Components

- Always buy Med Ingredients from Hospital! Sell Medication for profit

Amazing details

Shortages
	Randomly double the price for affected items, including yours.
	Does not affect sell price to Central Station (but DO affect buy price)
	3 days announcement on Radio, 4 days of actual shortage

Addictions
	Subtracted from inventory at each day start. Smoking/Crinking coffe animation is purely cosmetical
	Coffee addiction also deducts 1 Clean Water

Don't ever sell Lock Picks. Use them instead of Crowbar to save Inventory Slot. If Slot > 6 you had a profit.
	Avoid crafting them too (5.5), buy if necessary (6.0) to save on Components.

Shovel is overrated. Never use it in Shelter, carefully consider if taking it for Scavenging is really worth the Inventory Slot

Comfort
=======

Hidden mechanic sometimes mentioned but not fully explained in Wiki:
- Makes positive mood statuses last longer, and shortens negative ones
- Raised by Furniture and Books

@MestreLion According to the Storyteller, modifiers and caps for every group:

Armchair -  6 / 10
Bed      -  2 /  4
Book     -  1 / 10
Chair    -  3 /  9
Child    - 10
Guitar   - 15
Radio    - 10
Snowman  - 10
Zlata    - 10

Finally, there are configs for how the summed up comfort values work:
every range takes away certain amount of depression, however the threshold for all ranges is 31,
meaning the comfort items will not be taking away any depression if it's already 31 or below:

 0 -  6: 2
 7 - 13: 3
14 - 20: 4
21 - 28: 5
29 - 36: 6
37 - 55: 7
56 - ..: 8

Therefore: if you have 2 beds (4), Zlata (10) and 3 books (3), your comfort value = 17
and each survivor will lose 4 points of depression daily, provided that their depression value is above 31.
Adding, for example, third bed will not change that, as beds have a threshold of 4 units.

Do NOT give painting to colonel, give Taras the documents, do NOT help orphans escape.

The Janitor
-----------
requires you to not turn any of the artifacts into fuel and is recieved at the end of the game after you evacuate the museum

Fortify
-------
There are 8 total pillars that need reinforcing, using 5 components and 3 wood each. If you do not fix the pillar on the same day when given the option, it is possible for you to miss one and void the achievement
 I assumed the achievement was to keep the pillars standing and i was very confused when i would reinforce the pillars and they would break regardless the next day without being able to repair them again after the first time. This is completely fine as you can not keep the pillars standing. Reinforcing them allows you to pick up the artifacts on the ground and thats all you can do
