Training Room
=============
- Consultants don't lean anything, only teach
- On random intervals, Consultants randomly teach either 5 specialization
    (Research, Surgery, Psychiatry) or 20(2%) Skill (Junior -> Doctor -> Consultant),
    up to their max Skill
  - Research: 50 specialty points; Psychiatry: 65; Surgery: 80
- Consultant promotion only happens on a new year
- Tiredness affects learning speed if over 50%
- While bookcases and skeletons help, the teacher needs to take a full trip back for it to count. Only get one of each if you have to.
- Total Teacher training "capacity" is divided among students: best to have fewer students
- Strategy: teach specializations first, then train to Consultant from bare Consultant teacher


Tiredness
=========
- Keep it below 30% to avoid underpaid happiness issues

Heat
====
Radiators Keeps the hospital warm, which helps keep patients and staff happy.
You can fine-tune the corridor coverage in the hospital management screen where you can also look for hot or cold spots.
This is irrelevant for rooms; each radiator provides a set amount of heating (up to 78%) depending on the room size.

Block unused areas with benches - Less handyman movement
