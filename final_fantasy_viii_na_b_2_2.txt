Author's Note                                                 ffviii_002
========================================================================
Well, it has been a long time since I have made an update for the FAQ.
Even though the FAQ is already completed, there are still errors that
required me to correct it. 

What's has been added to the FAQ?
- Frequently Asked Questions --> Well, for the past few months since
  FF8 has been released, I have received countless e-mails regarding 
  this game and I have decided to compile them. Otherwise, I will be
  repeated those answers over and over again. Of course, once I have  
  added the list of questions, I will not be answering them anymore.
  BTW, if you have any problems regarding weapon upgrading, please
  refer to the ultimate weapon upgrading guide in Part I.

- The third hint of Obel Lake Mystery --> thanks to one helpful 
  contributor who has told me about this third hint [well, can't expect
  that it is actually a joke...]. Refer to Obel Lake Mystery Section
  for more details.

- Search Mode --> A lot of FAQ readers have complained to me that the 
  FAQ being too long as it takes ages to search for the information that 
  you need. I have finally found a method, which is being obtained from 
  Dingo Jellybean's FF7 FAQ but I have made some improvements to it. All 
  you just need to do the following: (Note: there are actually people 
  who tends to overlook this capability of WordPad and I myself is also 
  one of them ^_^;)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method 1:
  From the toolbar, select Edit and choose Find. Enter the keyword.

  Method 2:
  Use the short-cut key Ctrl+F and you will see the Search Box popped
  up. Enter the keyword that you want to look for. 

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  But sometimes the keyword does not reached your desired destination,
  hence I have come up with a good idea and that's to add codes to the
  right side of the contents page. Just enter the following keyword:

  ffviii_xxx 

  where xxx stands for the 3-digit code for the section. The list of 
  code numbers can be found at the Table of Contents. But remember that
  you must enter the "ffviii_" in order for it to work, or you will 
  find that you will end up at other pages instead! 

- Note to all webmasters. If you want to post the FAQ on your site, make
  sure that you keep update and get the latest versions. I will always 
  sent my FAQs to GameFAQs. I will definitely not permit anyone else to 
  edit my FAQs. No HTMLizing for my FAQs. Final Fantasy: Worlds Apart
  (http://www.ffnet.net) is an exception.

- Strangely enough, I have received e-mails regarding whether I am doing
  a FAQ for Final Fantasy IX. I am about 75% sure that I will NOT be 
  writing a FAQ for it due to several personal reasons. Anyway, I guess
  someone else will write a FAQ for that game. [But this means that you 
  can be ensured that there will be FAQs for Final Fantasy IX.] 

- I have corrected most of grammatical errors as being requested by 
  viewers. Thanks to them, otherwise I will not known the seriousness of
  the problems. I will try my best to correct errors for my other FAQs 
  once I have time. 

- I hoped that this may be the final update for this FAQ. BTW, I am no
  longer accepting strategies and questions regarding this FAQ. ALL the 
  stuffs that I know about FF8 can be found in this FAQ and Part II. If
  you have any recommendations, complaints, secrets regarding this game,
  and just e-mail to me and I will try my best to solve it.

- I am quite sorry for not answering any e-mails after my March 
  vacation as I have been rather busy with my assignments, projects
  and examinations. You should get your reply shortly. BTW, there will 
  be no reply for those who do not add "FF8" or "Final Fantasy VIII" as 
  I have deleted the e-mails that does not have this as a subject. [
  except for those that contains other game headings which I have 
  written a FAQ for...]

For this "possible" final update:
- This is probably going to the be last update of FAQ. I have gotten
  permission from The Saint about using some of Chocobo World
  information on the FAQ. For more details, I would recommend you to 
  take a look at his FAQs, which is also available at GameFAQs. 
- I have updated the frequently asked questions with more detailed 
  answers and hopefully, it could just solved your burning questions.
- BTW, I'm no longer accepting strategies as I guessed there is enough
  strategies and all the new strategies are just minor improvements over
  the existing ones. Unless there is a great importance, I would not add
  it.
- Last of all, good bye to those who read my FF8 FAQs... It's time for
  me to embark on a new FAQ writing journey...

                                                             [Scott Ong]

Frequently Asked Questions                                    ffviii_004
========================================================================
As you see, I still have a lot of other FAQs to manage. Hence it will be
best if you can add "FF8" as your subject so that I know that it is 
about Final Fantasy VIII. Lastly don't sent me any viruses/huge files.
If you have a strategy to contribute, just type it in the mail instead
add it to a text-file.

BTW, don't expect me to e-mail you the list of cards, where to get them
and other stuffs, you can get all these from the FAQs.

If you sent me a question which the answer can be found in the FAQ, I 
will most likely ask you to refer to the FAQ. As for certain quests such
as the Obel Lake Mystery, Missing Vase Pieces, don't expect me to type
out the entire information for you [as it can't be explain in a few 
paragraphs or so.]. Okay don't with the list [mostly repeated]:

Last Updated: 14/10/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list may be expanded depends on the number of e-mails that I have
recieved on that particular topic. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.   How do you junction commands?
A:   You can ONLY junction commands (such as Magic, Item, Draw, etc.) 
     and abilities (Mag-J, Str-J, Str+20%, SumMag +20%, Counter, Cover, 
     etc) if you have a GF equipped for the characters. To equip a GF,
     select the character and Junction from the main menu. Next pick a
     GF and you will be able to equip the command! You can more help 
     from the Tutorial Menu in the game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   How many GFs are there?
A:   There are a total of 16 GFs [GFs with abilities] and the 
     miscellaneous GFs. I have include the list and the brief method on 
     getting them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.   I had forgotten to draw a GF! Are there any other methods to get 
     it?
A:   YES! You can get the GF by drawing it from the BOSSES found in the
     Ultimecia's Castle. Refer to Disc 4 walkthrough for more 
     information. I did not include in the walkthrough as this will
     help to avoid spoilers. BTW, some of GF summoning items [Solomon's
     Ring for Doomtrain and Magical Lamp for Diablos] can be retrieved
     from the Pocketstation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.   I had sold the Magical Lamp! Is there a method to get it later in
     game?
A:   Unfortunately no. In fact, that's the only Magical Lamp you can 
     get from playing the game. You can get more Magical Lamps as you
     can get it from the Pocketstation. [Refer to Pocketstation guides
     that found in GameFAQs. You can find more information under the
     Pocketstation section in Part II. Please note that I don't own a 
     Pocketstation.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.   What is the purpose of SeeD tests?
A:   Note for all new players, you can only get cash through your SeeD
     salary. You will get your salary, once Squall has become an 
     official SeeD member after Dollet's test at Disc 1. The SeeD level
     will change if you do any of following:

     SeeD Test
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Method                                                Effect
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     Answering SeeD tests with correct answers. Access     Increase 
     SeeD test from Tutorial menu --> TEST menu.           SeeD level.

     Continue with the story of the game                   Increase
                                                           SeeD level.
  
     Finish Train sequence in Disc 1 upon first try        SeeD level
                                                           +1

     Walking around the world map, field terrains without  Decrease
     doing anything.                                       SeeD level

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     SeeD levels do not increase every time. In fact, it increases
     based on the number of steps that Squall walk on the terrains. 
     Hence, do not try to not overdo it as it will decrease your SeeD 
     level.

     The higher SeeD level, the more cash [in gil] that you will
     receive each time. For the test answers, refer to the walkthrough
     for disc 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.   I have seen a UFO moving around in a random battle and nothing 
     happens..  What was that?
A:   It is the UFO Sighting Incident. There are four sighting spots
     which is being marked on the world map found at 
     <http://risland.virtualave.net>. Just go there with Diablo's 
     Enc-None and move around to have a random battle. For more
     details, refer to the World Tour under the Disc 3 Walkthrough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.   Why I can't convert 100x Curse Spikes into Dark Matter through GF
     Siren's Tool-RF, in order learn Quistis' last Limit Break, 
     Shockwave Pulsar?
A:   In order to do that, GF Siren must reach LV 100. Otherwise, you 
     will not be able to do the refinement. As for the help in getting
     Curse Spikes, you need to defeat the Imp, Forbidden or Malboro.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.   Is it true that you can't have both items obtained from stealing
     and defeat monsters?
A:   Yes. You can get only get one of the items. For example, let's 
     says you encountered a battle with 2x Adamantoises, you defeat 
     them without any characters using the Mug command. You will get 
     the item won from battle, such as Adamantine, Whisper, Orichalons 
     based on Squall's level.
     If you mug any of the Adamantoises, you will DEFINATELY NOT get 
     Adamantine [which can only be obtained by defeating both 
     Adamantoises]. Instead, you will get other items such as Whispers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.   How do I get Squall's ultimate weapon and Limit Break, Lion Heart?
A:   To get Squall's ultimate weapon, you must have the following
     items:
     1x    Adamantine
     3x    Dragon Fang
     12x   Pulse Ammo

     << Recommended Methods >> - these are the easiest methods
     Adamantine - you can get this by defeat Adamantoises found shores 
     of Dollet, Long Horn Island [to find the location of Long Horn 
     Island, view the world map at http://risland.virtualave.net].

     Dragon Fang - head towards Trabia area where you find the Shumi 
     Village. Note that from the world map's point of view, you will
     find a row of mountains behind the village. Just walk closely 
     against mountains and you will encounter Blue Dragons. Defeat it
     to get Dragon Fang.

     Pulse Ammo - you need to get Energy Crystal. Get 20x Elynole's card
     via card playing and you can convert them into 2x Energy Crystals
     through Quezacotl's Card-Mod RF. Next convert the Energy Crystals 
     through Ifrit's Ammo-RF. You will get 20x Pulse Ammo. 

     Now go to any of the junk shops found in the game and pay 2000 gil 
     to remodel Squall's gunblade into Lion Heart. I have explained in
     more details under the Ultimate Weapon Upgrading section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.  Where are the Islands closest to Heaven / Hell?
A:   It is kind of difficult to explain using words. You can get find 
     the locations of them on a world map at my website 
     <http://risland.virtualave.net/map.html>. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.  I can't locate the Deep Sea Research Center! Where can I find it?
A:   To locate the Deep Sea Research Center, you need the Ragnarok 
     airship. Pilot the airship to the extreme low-left corner of the 
     world map. 

     Move the Ragnarok low by press Down button. When you move the 
     Ragnarok, you should see water splashing... Next navigate around 
     that corner and you should find the Deep Sea Research Center. If 
     you have any problems, get the world map mentioned in the above 
     URL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.  Why is there a screen showing "censored" when I used the Devour
     Command? 
A:   It was just like that! ^_^;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.  Question on Card Games
A:   Well, it consists of a huge portion of my e-mails. Here is a 
     section for it:

     Rare Cards - it is true that there is only one version of rare
     cards, not after time compression has occurred. To get back the
     lost rare cards, you need to defeat the CC Group Members at 
     Ragnarok airship in Disc 4. (provided that you have defeat them 
     in Disc 2.). You can get them back even after you have refined the
     card using Quezacotl's Card-Mod.
   
     Card Queen - the Card Queen is really tough as she changes the
     card rules and moves from areas to areas, which made her an 
     extremely tough opponent. If you need more help, get FF8 FAQ
     Part II at http://www.gamefaqs.com and refer to the Card Queen's
     Side Quest.

     Obtaining cards - besides getting it by winning the card game, 
     you can also get cards by defeating enemies or using the card 
     command to convert dying enemies into cards [does not work on
     BOSS and human beings]

     Card Rules - It will be very difficult to explain the rules in
     a few sentences, hence there is a need to read the Card section
     of FF8 FAQ Part II.

     Abolish a Card Rule - a lot of gamers get frustrated regarding
     the random rule as it will force you into a bad situation in the
     card game. To abolish that rule, you can either play in a region
     where there is no such rules. One perfect example is Balamb area.
     Rules will be added as soon as you started in an area where there
     are new rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.  Tough Battles - answers found at my Monsters FAQ @ GameFAQs
A:   It seems that a lot of people are having trouble regarding combat
     in FF8. There are a few reasons for the toughness and one of them 
     is that monsters levelling up as your character does. There are 
     few methods to be stronger than your enemy:
     The hints are:
     - by remodelling the characters' weapons 
     - get stronger spells via item refining. 
     You can get a lot of rare items via cards. This means if you want 
     an easy life in the game, play cards often!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.  Can I get into the cities during Disc 4?
A:   There is no way that you can get into the cities in Disc 4. Those
     barriers do not allow you to make contact with the city. I know
     the following question will definitely pop up if this happens...
     * how do I remodel my weapons? - you can remodel your weapons by 
       using GF Tonberry's Call Shop or Call Junk Shop menu ability via
       the Ability menu. 
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.  I have sold the Magical Lamp. Is there any other way to get it?
A:   Finally found the answers for this... You can't draw Diablos from
     any of the bosses [bosses at Lunatic Pandora and Boss Sphinxaur in 
     Ultimecia's Castle]. Once you sold it, you got to reset if you 
     don't own a Pocketstation or Gameshark. It is still possible to 
     complete the game without GF Diablos, but it will definitely be 
     tougher.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.  Where are weapon monthly magazines?
A:   You don't need these items as it is compulsory to remodel your 
     characters' weapon. In fact, the weapon's name will appear in the 
     Junk Shop's menu once you have obtained its requirements. Here is a 
     short list of weapon magazines:

     Weapon Monthly March  - you will get this by defeating Elvoret at
                             Dollet's Communication Tower in Disc 1.
     Weapon Monthly April  - you will get this from Squall's desk after
                             completing the sequence in Training 
                             Center. (after the ball dance)
     Weapon Monthly May    - you can find this in the sewers while 
                             controlling Rinoa. Refer to walkthrough for
                             more information.
     Weapon Monthly June   - defeat BGHZ51F2 at Missile Base
     Weapon Monthly July   - found it in Balamb Garden's Training Center
                             after Disc 2.
     Weapon Monthly August - found it near the Gargoyle in Trabia 
                             Garden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.  Why I can't get the second vase piece (found at the statue) in 
     Winhill?
A:   Well, this is really my error and thanks to those whom have help me
     in solving this and that is you really need to have Irvine in your 
     party. I guess it was perhaps due to the itching hands of 
     Irvine ^_^;) Remember the time when he messes up the guns in Zell's
     room [for those whom have Irvine in your party]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.  Where can I locate the Tomb of Unknown King?
A:   It seems that this type of question is one of hardiest for me to
     answer. Imagine explaining the location using words. It was 
     actually located on a peninsula, which is northeast from Deling. The
     tomb is quite small in size and if you still have the problem, get
     the world map found at <http://risland.virtualave.net>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.  How do I use the character's Limit Breaks?
A:   First of all, your characters need to get to "Crisis" conditions. 
     It will be fulfilled when:
     - the character's HP turns red/yellow
     - Aura is being cast on the character

     Next to use the Limit Break, just tap Circle button (menu button)
     and you will eventually see a golden triangle on the right side of
     "Attack" or "Mug". Press right and you will be able to execute the
     Limit Break.

     General Tip on getting Aura.
     Aura is a magic that allows your character to get Limit Breaks
     easily. To get Aura magic, you need to get Fury Fragments which 
     can be mugged from Blue Dragon found at the mountains near Shumi
     Village. [you don't need to stand on the mountain, just go near 
     it]. Next just convert the Fury Fragment into 5x Aura magic 
     through Leviathan's Supt Mag-RF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.  How do I return back to the Lunatic Pandora after I have finished
     the "Ragnarok crash scene" in Disc 3?

A:   You can choose to exit the Pandora after your Ragnarok has made 
     its way to the Lunatic Pandora in Disc 3. To exit, just to talk to 
     Selphie. From there, you can enjoy yourself for the quests or do
     some level up. After you are done, proceed to the bridge [or 
     controls room] and talk to Selphie and you will be back at the
     Lunatic Pandora!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.  Is it possible to do the Lion Heart Limit Break each time once you
     have acquired the Lion Heart gunblade?
A:   No. The occurence of the Lion Heart Limit Break depends on chance.
     You can't control it. But Lion Heart seems to appear more 
     frequently, once the entire party is down to critical status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.  How do I get Limit Breaks for every characters?
A:   Squall  - Upgrade his gunblade and Squall will learn new Limit 
               Breaks. [see Part II for more details.]
     Quistis - Get Blue Magic Items [refer to Part II item bestiary on
               how to get them] and use it on Quistis.
     Zell    - Get Combat Kings and select the item and Zell will learn
               the new Limit Breaks automatically.
     Selphie - Get it from her Limit Breaks. While you are choosing the
               type of spells, you can find her Limit Breaks [including
               those that are not uncovered.]. Cast it and Selphie will
               have that Limit Breaks.
     Rinoa   - Get Pet Pals and select the item. Next check the status
               screen and select the limit break that you wish to teach
               Angelo. Hence walk around on the terrain for a while. 
               Once the gauge has built up, Rinoa will learn the Limit
               Break!
     Irvine  - Get the Ammo and he will have new Limit Breaks. Some of
               the rare ammo are quite hard to get.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. How do I enhance my character's statistics?
A:  Through the junction system. The junction system is a system that 
    could enfuse magic to your character's atttributes, hence making 
    them stronger. See Basic Tutorial for more information. BTW, the
    effects of Junction are affected by the following:
    . Number of magic: The more you have, the better the effect of the
      junction system.
    . Types of spell: The stronger the spell you have, the better the
      effect the junction has on the character.
    Junction also allows your characters to equip commands and 
    abilities. There is no accessories/armor in the game. Please read
    the Basic Tutorial thoroughly. You need to have junction abilities
    [i.e. abilities that are ended with "-J"] for boosting your 
    character's statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How do I upgrade my weapons in FF8?
A:  You can't buy new weapons instead you can tune them up through Junk
    Shops. But in order to do this, you need to have specific 
    ingredients such as M-Stone Piece, Sharp Spike, Dragon Fang, etc.
    Of course, not everything in the world is free. You need to pay a
    small sum to upgrade them to new models [you can choose to upgrade
    or downgrade.] Everytime you attempt to remodel the weapon, the 
    ingredients will be used up. If you want to upgrade back to the 
    same weapon, you need to get new ingredients. To upgrade a weapon in
    Disc 4, just get GF Doomtrain [Call Junk Shop menu ability] and do
    the following:
    1) Activate your menu.
    2) Select the Ability header.
    3) Select Call Junk Shop
    4) Do what you normally do at Junk Shops.
    It's pretty simple huh? BTW, don't try to force your way in the 
    towns, as it is impossible!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. How I mug an item?
A:  This one is pretty hard to explain if you don't know anything about
    junction commands or abilities. First of all, you need to get a GF
    ability called "Mug" [from Bahamut or Diablos, requires 200 AP to
    master]. Next equip GF Bahamut or Diablos with the mastered Mug 
    ability. After you have equipped the commands, you will be able to
    select the type of character/party abilities. Choose Mug and add it
    to one of the ability slots. If you equip the ability, you should 
    see the attack command is being replaced with Mug. If that happens,
    you are on the right track.
    Just go to a random battle and look for the monster that you want
    to steal an item from. Remember to watch for the top status bar 
    after your character has performed the attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. How do I junctioned commands?
A:  Before I start this, I need to explain that GFs are extremely 
    important as they worked like Materia in FF7. Without them, you 
    can't have other commands besides attack. First of all, you need to 
    get a GF. [If you have seen through the ability list in Part II, you
    should noticed that all the 16 GFs have Magic, GF and Draw.]

    To equip a command, do the following step-by-step and make sure that
    you are in the main menu.
    1) Select Junction from the main menu
    2) Select the character who you want to junction GFs with.
    3) Select Junction command from the Junction Menu. Select the GFs
       that you want to equip with. Press Triangle once you are done.
    4) You should be brought to the Auto screen if you have magic in 
       that character's magic inventory. Choose either Atk, Def or Mag.
       If your character don't have any magic, you will be brought to
       the Ability sub-menu directly. Press Triangle once you are done.
    5) At the ability screen, you should see the command list of the
       character with the slots along with ability slots. On the right
       is the list of commands available (if the cursor is pointing at
       either one of the three command slots, they are found under the
       Attack command) and list of abilities available (if the cursor
       is pointing at either one of ability slots.) Just pick and choose
       from the list. Duplicate commands will only appear once. [For
       example, as I had mentioned earlier, that all 16 GFs have the 3
       basic commands, GF, Magic and Draw. These commands will appear 
       only once even if you have more than 1 GFs equipped.] Press
       Triangle once you are done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. Where do General Caraway go after he had brought you to the Gateway?
A: It is pretty funny that I got such e-mails more than twice ^_^;). 
   After Caraway have move away from the Gateway, head towards the left
   side of the screen. You should be brought to the front screen where
   you see crowds and the gateway. Notice that there is no people on the
   left side of the crowd. Just walk down and exit from the screen. You
   will meet Caraway there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. Who is Squall's father?
A: This may be a piece of spoiler [heck, anyway by typing out the FAQ,
   I had already spoiled the game...]. There is my evidence to support
   that Laguna Loire is Squall's father!

   A) If you re-visit Winhill, you will found out that the photo of the
      family (Laguna, Raine, "Squall" and Ellone) is missing. The photo
      is found at Raine's House [next to the pub]
   B) Laguna has probably left Squall in the hands of Edea before 
      leaving for his journey to rescue Ellone. You had see sequences of
      Squall standing in the rain feeling bored and Laguna talking to
      Edea... (btw, this may be wrong as it is my own assumption)
   C) If you talk to Ward or Kiros, you make get more information leaked
      out about Squall and Laguna [that's a pretty good hint by the 
      way...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. Have you heard any rumours about FF8?
A:  Definitely yes! Of course, FF8 is such a great RPG and there are 
    also have some loopholes just like FF7 and so you can expect some
    rumours about the game.

 A) Getting Cloud Strife
    Well, I myself is also a fan of Cloud. But I don't have sufficient
    proof that Cloud is in the game. But based on gameshark, it is not
    possible to have Cloud. This always works btw. But here are some 
    rumours [they seems a bit reasonable...]
    1) Have 16 gameovers at the Island closest to Hell. Upon the 16th
       continue, Cloud will appear... 
       My Reply: This is definitely not true!
    2) During the battle against the Iron Clad [the BOSS at the missile
       base], you can mug an item from the BOSS which allows you to
       summon Cloud Strife! [Cloud will appears and do his Omnislash
       Limit Break!]
       My Reply: Haven't tested it yet as my party was too strong...
       I have killed that stupid Iron Clad with a few attacks...

 B) Getting GF Griever/ a hidden GF
    You can get GF Griever in Lunatic Pandora. You must have all the
    weapons, 666 items or something to that nature. Also in Balamb, 
    next to Zell's house, an old man makes reference to an old story/
    legend.
    My Reply: 
    . About the ridiculous 666 item:
      This isn't true as it is impossible to have 666 of an item type.
      So give up your hopes... [That 666 items requirement is actually
      taken from Occult Fan III, which refers to GF Doomtrain ^_^; If
      you break the numbers up along with other issues, you should get
      6x Steel Pipes, 6x Malboro Tentacles, 6x Remedy+]
    . An old man...
      Well, I guessed this may be partly right... I'm not sure about
      this anyway. But since half of the rumour is wrong, it is just
      as good as the rumour is false.

C)  Getting Seifer after Dollet Mission
    I know that there will be a lot of Seifer's fan hoping that this 
    could be true. Well, I have recently received a rumour regarding
    this...

Luckily for us, FAQ writers for FF8, Rinoa did not die in the game...
Otherwise we may be facing problems like resurrecting Rinoa... *Phew*
I have excluded some of rumours to save me from e-mails probing...
BTW, here is a point of advice from me and that is don't be cheated by
rumours. (Provided that there is sufficient proof to prove it... at 
least a screenshot of the rumour. Like showing Cloud fighting against
any monster that's included in FF8.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. Why can't I equip Card Mod-RF on my character?
A:  You can't equipped that on a character. There are several types of
    abilities and below is a short summary on the abilities types:

    Type         How to use it?
    Character    You need to equip it to enable its effect. Go to
                 Junction menu and choose the fourth tab, Abilities.
    GF           Automatically takes effect once the GF has mastered
                 the ability. Note that the learnt ability only applies
                 to that GF, which has the ability in its slot.
    Junction     It allows some of the Junction options to be enable on
                 the Junction status screen. For example, if the
                 equipped GFs does not have any Str-J, the Str option
                 will be greyed out. There is no need to equip the 
                 ability, just equiped GF to enable its effect.
    Menu         One of the abilities that can't be equipped. You can
                 access this ability under Ability sub-menu of the main
                 menu. [Card Mod-RF is a type of menu ability]
    Party        Same as character ability, need to equip, followed the
                 same method as character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. Is it possible to defeat the BOSS at lower levels compared to the
    statistics that you have given in the FAQ?
A:  Of course, you don't need to go to that extreme ^_^;). This is one
    of the reasons which makes FF8 different from FF7. Monsters, 
    including BOSSES get level up as your characters level up [in 
    proportion to Squall's level.], which means the higher Squall's
    level is, the more HP or level will be the BOSS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. How do I get Mog's Amulet?
A:  This is one time that can only be achieved by playing the Choco
    World. Besides, I have stressed on this many times...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. How do I get more Rosetta Stones?
A:  To get more Rosetta Stones, you can either use the refinement method
    or search method. Rosetta Stones can be refined using a Menu 
    Ability. [please refer to Menu abilities, FF8 Part II FAQ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. How do I get Zell's Armageddon Fist?
A:  This is actually a move that invented by one of FF8 gamers, Kaze
    Yagami [beats me why everyone choose to use to this name...]. It is
    actually a chain between Punch Rush, Booya, Punch Rush, Booya....
    [I guess you should know that flow...]. It is named this, because of
    its killing effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. How do I exit from Ultimecia's Castle in Disc 4?
A:  A simple analogy... How do you exit from your home? Of course,
    through the door! or the window [unless you are Spiderman or theft,
    otherwise I have no comments ^_^]. Just go back to the main hall
    and exit the door. Go to the chain and choose any of the doors to
    get back to the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. Must I followed the story sequence based on the walkthrough?
A:  YES! All except for World Tours [or sub-quest which other FAQ 
    writers call it.]. If you don't follow in order, like going to 
    Galbadia Garden before you have finished up with Timber story
    sequence, you will find Galbadia Soldiers surrounding the building.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
38. Does Ultimecia's castle contains every single enemy?
A:  YES! You can find virtually all the monsters that is available in
    the game. But some of them don't appear that frequently like 
    Malboros, Tonberries and Elynoles. I have managed to encounter an
    Elynole on my trip up the clock tower...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
39. When and where is the best place to level up all your characters?
A:  It depends only on your character current level. IMO, I guess it is
    best not to stress on your character's current level, as certain 
    enemies are really a killer even it is only a level 15 monsters.
    The area where you get most EXP is from the enemies in the Island
    closest to Hell and Heaven, don't know where it is? Refer to the
    maps found at my website <http://risland.virtualave.net>!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. No Alexander, No Doomtrain? --> Getting Remedy +
A:  Getting Doomtrain is one of hardiest feature in FF8, you need to get
    in pursuit of items and met its requirement to get it. First of all,
    you need to get all the requirements of 6x Steel Pipes, 6x Malboro
    Tentacles and 6x Remedy+ (!). After gotten the requirements, use 
    the item "Solomon's Ring" to get GF Doomtrain. The key link between
    Alexander and Doomtrain is the requirement of Remedy+. If you don't
    have Remedy+, you can't get GF Doomtrain. To get Remedy+, you need
    to use Med LV Up [menu ability] to convert 60x Remedy [which can be
    bought from shops]. As for the other requirements, please refer to
    the walkthrough or FF8 FAQ Part II.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. Gilgamesh interrupted my fight against Adel and kill Rinoa!
A:  One comments: The gamer is really unlucky ^_^;) You really needs to
    depend on luck and pray hard that Gilgamesh does not appear.
    Actually, IMO, I guess you need to make sure that at least one of
    members has most of the HP as this reduces the appearance of
    Gilgamesh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. How to get back Odin after I have gotten Gilgamesh?
A:  Sorry pals, as there is no way to get back Odin after Gilgamesh...
    Odin is already killed in half by Seifer in the battle at Lunatic
    Pandora [Disc 3], that's why Odin can never appear, beside its
    sword is already taken by Gilgamesh ^_^; so how is it going to 
    attack? Besides in FF8, there is no lance for Odin...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. How does the Rare Item takes it effect?
A:  It is one of doubts which still remains a mystery for me... 
    Typically, Rare Item is party ability and takes effect after you
    have finished the random battles and just increase the "chances" [
    I don't how it was being measured, but according to my gameplay, it
    seems to give me more GF type items and rarer items, but decreases
    the rate of junk items (which is more cheaper...)]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. Why I have never found Selphie's Limit Break <The End>?
A:  IMO, you need to take a lot of patience in getting this. The End
    appears about 1 out of 100 tries while using the Slots. You need to
    press "Do over" [1st option] and switch and switch... until you
    found the spell... But if you miss it, it WILL take you more longer
    to find it again in next try! Besides you can't use The End at your
    will since it is an instant killer spell!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
45. Is it possible to complete the game without all GFs?
A:  Of course, the completion of the game depends on your will. If you
    want to have an easy fight, I would recommend you to get all GFs. In
    other words, it is not necessary to get all GFs to complete the
    game. The aim of this walkthrough is just to give you a clearer
    picture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Notes
Things can't be done without a gameshark/pocketstation:
- Get Apocalypse magic before the fight against True form of Ultimecia.
- Get another Magical Lamp besides the one you get it from Cid.
- Get Ribbon/Mog's Amulet/Friendship item.
- Rare GF Abilities such as Supt Mag-RF, Discount, Awarness, etc.

Things that never can be done...
- Enter towns in Disc 4
- Find the gateways to the chain road in front of Ultimecia's Castle 
  before Disc 4.
- Find the white SeeD Ship after you return from space visit.
- Read the Girl Next Door (it is a junk item...)

Guardian Forces                                               ffviii_s01
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs are the returning summons from the previous FF series. Generally,
there are a lot of differences between them. GF stands for Guardian 
Force and it is a common abbreviation used in the game. 

Differences between the previous series:
- GFs have statues just like your characters. They can level up just 
  like your characters in gaining EXP and they can accquired AP to 
  learn abilities.
- Summon GFs does not requires MP. There is no MP required to summon
  GFs. Instead, the GF's stats will overlap the character's stats, 
  taking the Elem-Def-J and ST-Def-J from the character and also
  withstand from the enemy. Summon GFs require time and you need 
  the blue ATB bar drop to zero (or empty) and GF will be summoned. 
  Once GF's HP have drop to zero, the summon will be cancelled off.
- GF obtain methods can varies... such as defeating them, accquired
  them by meeting requirements, draw them from BOSSES.
- GFs are the strength of your characters as they gave your characters
  other abilities beside the Attack command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frequently Asked Questions About GFs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the list of frequently asked questions about Guardian Forces. 
There are a total of 9 questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: I have forgetten to draw a GF, is there a way to get it back?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. But you can only get it back in Disc 4, from either one of BOSSES
in Ultimecia's Castle. Of course, you have to unlock Draw, otherwise it
is useless. Refer to Disc 4 Walkthrough: Ultimecia's Castle in Part I
(@ at GameFAQs, http://www.gamefaqs.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:  Why I don't see Med LV Up in Alexander's Ability list?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must obtain its prequisite in order to get its secondary ability.
I have expanded the list section, just accompany this purpose. Refer to
the abilities lists and description for more information. There are 
also certain cases that results lost of an ability:

Case #1
You may eliminate the Ability/ its prequisite through using an Amnesia 
Greens.

For this case, I can't help ^_^; Have to restart. You may need to try
to use another GF Item to replace that. As far I know, GF menu and
item refinements have no replacements. 

Case #2
You may use a GF Ability Item to cover up one of 22 slots. 

In this case, just use an Amnesia Greens to eliminate one of abilities
so that, there is avaliable space for the ability to "grow" on it. 
[Is there any better words?]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3: I have sold the Magical Lamp, is it possible to get it back?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. But unless you have a Pocketstation or Gameshark. For gameshark, 
just make use of the item modifier code to do it. If you have a 
Pocketstation, you can get it via Choco World. To do that, refer to 
Pocketstation FAQs that are found at GameFAQs.

Q4: How to I get GF Doomtrain?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to get the requirements: 6x Steel Pipe, 6x Malboro Tentacle,
6x Remedy+ (requires GF Alexander's Med LV Up, or Pocketstation) and 
of course, the Solomon's Ring. Refer to GF Bestiary for more 
information

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: Is it possible to get GF Griever?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know. But most likely it's not. There is a rumour regarding
Occult Fan III [Magic Issue], that you need 666 items to get this GF,
the ring shown in the picture is actually the Solomon's Ring and 666
stands for "Steel Pipe", "Malboro Tentacles", "Remedy+". [it may be a 
piece of displeasing news ^_^;]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6:  How do I get Mog Amulet and Friendship item?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't ask me about this.. These items can only be gotten through the 
Pocketstation. I am still trying to figure other methods besides 
gameshark.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7: How do I boost a GF?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check the Boost Section under GF Abilities. Or you can get the in-game 
help [provided that you have gotten the Battle Meter]:

Tutorial -> Information -> Abilities -> GF Abilities -> Boost

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q8: How do I get GF Gilgamesh?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have gotten Odin before you reached the final battle at the
Lunatic Pandora in Disc 3. It is not necessary for you to kill Seifer as 
Gilgamesh will finish it up for you. You will lose Odin as it is lost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9: Why I can't use Tool-RF to convert 100x Curse Spikes into 1x Dark 
    Matter?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GF Siren must reached LVL. 100 or you can unlock it by upgrading your 
Battle Meter at the D-District Prison. This is allocated from my 
previous save files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Typically, it just like the ASCII Art shown above. The GFs slot will be
occupied by the GF, once you have accquired it. GFs can be found during
your jounery. To ensure no difficulties in getting them, take a look at
the walkthrough and follow the instructions there and you should have 
no problems. Most GFs can obtained through drawing from BOSSES, so it
is best to have Draw Command equip GFs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which GFs have them?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a brief explaination of GF Status Screen. Quezacotl, Shiva, 
Ifrit, Siren, Brothers, Diablos, Carbuncle, Leviathan, Pandemona, 
Cerberus, Alexander, Doomtrain, Bahamut, Cactuar, Tonberry and Eden are
the sixteen obtainable GFs and have this status screens. GFs such as 
Moomba (via Pocketstation), MiniMog (via Pocketstation), Chicobo, Odin,
Gilgamesh and Phoenix does not have this screen. As for unattainable 
GFs such as Griever and Tiamat, you can't have them in your besitary.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Abilities?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abilities are skills that allows GFs to learn to enhance besides 
summoning it. There are six major classes and here are a summary of 
what each of them does:

Command - allows your character to have commands besides attack. All
the first 16 GFs have the four basic commands: Item, Magic, GF and
Draw. There are also other commands such as Card, Darkside, Absorb,
Devour, etc. Each commands have different effects, so it's your option
to test them out.

Junction - under the Junction screen you will see that you can could 
make use magic to boost up a character's statistics through Junction. 
But in order to junction magic, you must have an ability for that 
junction. E.g. You must have Str-J in order to junction magic to Str.
Elemental Combos and Status combos can be done using junction abilities
such as Elem-Atk-J or Elem-Def-J, ST-Atk-J or ST-Def-J.

Character - these abilities are rather hard to obtain. These abilities
allows you to have add-ons such as Str + 20%, Mag +40%, HP +80%, etc.
There are also some special abilities such as Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, 
Mug, etc. These skills are pretty hard to mastered due to its high AP
Consumption [of course, not as exagrating as AP requirements for the
Materia in FF7.]. They can be equiped under the Ability section where
you could equipped commands. Most GFs have 2 abilities to equip. 
Except for GFs with Ability x3 and Ability x4. Well, the abbreviation
seems a bit clear, therefore no explaination ^_^;

GF - Abilities meant for GFs.. There are typically three types, SumMag,
GF HP and Boost. GF HP is avaliable for all GFs. SumMag is avaliable 
for GFs with a summon attack that has a elemental or non-elemental, 
except support element (e.g. Reflect, Triple/Double). Boost is a pretty
good ability.

Menu - A brand new innovation that has been included in this new epic 
RPG. The Menu ability allows you to do refinement of items and magic and
some even allows you to call item shop and get discounts, sell for 
higher prices, etc. Ability menus for magic are quite good as some magic
are very hard to obtained. One good example is Aura. Item refinement 
usually nabs you Medicine, Battle Items and GF Items.

Party - this ability can be activate through the same method for 
character ability. In fact it affects for the entire party. There are 
only four party ability in the game. Examples are Enc-Half [reduces 
encounter rate by half.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to learn Abilities?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty simple. Just select the GF that you wish to learn a particular 
ability using X button. Next you will have the status screen except you
can't see abilities screen instead you will find red bars that shows 
compatibility of GFs for the characters. The higher the comptability, 
the faster the GF will be summoned and the less crosses you will find 
during Boost. Press X once again and you will find the abilities page.
Each GF can only accquired a maximum of 22 abilities. Certain abilities
require a prequisite in order to get the new ability. So refer to the
GF besitary to find out more. Just simply select the ability that you
wished to learn with the cursor. Next gain AP in battles. Once the 
ability is mastered. A "Complete!" sign will replaced the requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to learn Abilities through using GF items?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not that it is not advisble to use GF items immediately before you have
gotten all GF abilities. Otherwise, you will not be able to obtain some
of GF abilities. To undo the wrong, just get Amnesia Greens and use it 
on a GF and forget the ability that you have just added. Remember that
abilities that you have forgetten, can't be gotten back! Also have an
additional save file before you attempt to do this. Note that you can't
have the two of same ability. Example: you can't have two SumMag +30%
and this applies for any other abilities. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, there are a lot of problems regarding GF's HP. The 
Quezacotl's maximum HP does not reached 9999 HP at Level 100 as due to 
its low EXP requirements to level Up. GF Eden can easily get 9999 HP at 
the level of 56 with GF HP +10% ~ 40% learnt and it has a higher EXP 
level compared a full EXP level Quezacotl. Certain GFs take ages to 
level up. Bahamut and Eden are great examples of these.

Note: It is not compulsory that a GF has the same ability list as it has
      from the beginning. You can overwrite them by using GF item, 
      Amnesia Greens.

========================================================================
Management of GFs                                             ffviii_006
========================================================================
Here are several tips that I would like share on about management of 
GFs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #1 - All GFs into battles!
Always get ALL GFs into battles [not necessary to summon them, but 
make sure that they are along with your characters to gain EXP]. They 
gain HP Bonuses and they will inflict more damage when they are at 
higher levels. You can easily use Junction Exchg under the Switch menu
to transfer the junction from one character to another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #2 - Got for Rare Abilities first.
Always go after rare skills first (one good example is GF Diablos' Mug.
This skill is pretty handy if you need to get the rare items such as
Steel Pipes.) Some abilities such as Auto-Haste, Card Mod-RF are very
useful add-ons for your party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #3 - Junction Distribution
Distribute the G.Fs evenly to all characters. Make sure everyone has 
junction to four basic factors:

Strength (Str)  - affects character's attacking power.
Magic (Mag)     - affects character's magic attacking power.
Vitality (Vit)  - affects the character's defense from physical damage.
Hit Points (HP) - affects the character's HP. It is the life bar!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #4 - Get Boost first! 
For those GFs with "Boost", always get them beforehand of all other
GF abilities. This ability can really does a lot of damage as if you
does up to a maximum of 4 times the damage compared to a normal summon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #5 - Make use of AP won from BOSS fight.
Always check what abilities that you are learning before get into BOSS 
battles. Always pick those high AP skills that require to master before 
fighting them, thus making full use of the bonus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #6 - Recover HP of GFs with GF Potions
Use G-Potions to recover lost HP of your GFs. BTW, GFs have (auto, I 
guessed it was a hidden ability) Walk and Recover. Just walking around
the field map, allows you to restore HP of GFs slowly at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip #7 - Improve GF Compatibility
Summoning a GF many times using the same character, helps to improve the 
GF's compatibility with the character. "Boost" will work best in this 
case. GF compatibility affects the speed of the ATB bar of GF [the 
higher the compatibility, the faster the GF will be summoned!] Of 
course, there are generally alternate methods such as using 
compatibility items [refer to Items section for more information] or 
the ultimate compatibility booster item, LuvLuv G.

How to get the GF?                                            ffviii_007
========================================================================
The list below comprises of the method to get them (briefly as I have
already explained in great detail in the walkthrough found in Part I)
I have also included the second draw method for certain GFs. Of course,
there are also GFs that I still not sure whether it is possible to get
them..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
E-mails about GFs
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GF Diablos - I have Received a lot of e-mails regarding a second method
as they have sold off the item Magical Lamp which teleports you to the
World of Darkness. If you know the method, besides this, kindly e-mail
me the method! You will be helping a lot of people out there! My 
assumption is that you can draw it from the Mobile Type 8, Seifer or
Sphinxaur. Well, it is already known that you can get Magicial Lamp
through Pocketstation or Gameshark. As for directly from the game,

GF Gilgamesh - Is there another method in getting it? I am not sure..

GF Griever - that stupid Occult Fan III which reveals a ring that allows
you to summon the GF with 666 items. Actually, that is meant for the
Doomtrain ^_^; So seek another method...

About it's Summon Attack: Zantesuken ["Cutting Iron Sword"]
Well, it is an instant killer weapon, however we can't have the Odin 
use his Gungen Lance of FF7... The Zantesuken typically works on all
non-BOSSES except for Cactuars. 

*frequent encounter* - Monsters that you encountered in a repetitive 
battles. E.g. you have encounter a Mesmerize in the first battle. Next
you encounter another Mesmerize. Chances of Odin appearing, will be 
increased greatly

Command Abilities (!)                                         ffviii_010
========================================================================
Command abilities are typically abilities that allows your character to
use it while in battle. Character has already known the attack command
and their Limit Breaks [based on certain citeria.] All the first 16 GFs

items that allows you to learn the ability.

It allows your character to cast Magic that is stocked in the 
character's Magic inventory. Each character has a maximum of 8 Magic 
pages and each page can stored up to 100x of the spells. Each slot is
only avaliable for one specific magic. When you activate the magic 
command, you will view something like the one shown below:

|P1          Num |
|Fire        100 |  After you have select the command, just select the
|Blizzard    100 |  spell that you wished to cast, pressing the X
|Thunder     100 |  button. 
|Ultima      100 |
|________________|

When Triple or Double is cast, you will have additional boxes of 
commands:
 _________                GF Cerberus provides both Double/Triple 
| Attack  |  ________     status on the Entire party. Double allows
| Magic  >| |Single  |    you to cast 2x Magic [same spell] and Triple
| GF      | |Double  |    allows you to cast 3x Magic [same spell].
| Draw    | |Triple  |    This allows you to cast magic in a few turns
|_________| |________|    and at the same time, allow you to choose the
                          opponent/ally that you wished to cast the 
                          spell on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                     G F
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   All
Item:  GF Scroll
Can't: GF's HP reached zero
       Under Silence, Berserk, Confuse, KO, Petrify, Sleep status.
AP:    n/a

A command that allows you to summon a GF. Remember that you must equip
this command before you can use to summon GFs. This command is pretty 
helpful as it summons the most powerful weapons [err.. early in the 
game.]. After you have summon the GF, the GF's ATB will cover the
character's ATB. Well, the GF's ATB is moving in a different direction.
Once the GF's ATB has reached zero, the GF will be summoned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 D r a w
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   All
Item:  Draw Scroll
Can't: Have already 100x stocked in the magic inventory
       Under Silence, Berserk, Confuse, KO, Petrify, Sleep status
AP:    n/a

One of the most important command. This command is the command that 
allows you to stock magic. This command is essential to draw magic from
the field screen or battle screen. In the field screen, you will give 
the spell that's found in the Draw Point and allow you whom to draw the
magic. In the combat screen. You need to do the following:
 _________
| Mug     |             
| Magic   |  _______                             _______
| Recover | |Stock  |  --> Monster's draw list  |Fira   |
| Draw   >| |Cast   |      e.g. Bite Bug        |Scan   |
|_________| |_______|                           |_______|

No matter what option you choose between Stock or Cast, you will 
still ended up at the Monster's draw list. Stock allows you to draw the
desired spell [up to a maximum of 9x per draw] and saves it in the 
character's magic inventory. Cast, on the hand, allows you to draw 1x
quantity and cast on the enemy/ally. Remember the Stock has a 
probability of failure as due to the character's low Mag stats or the
monster has died before the character gets his/her turn to draw. Cast
has no failure rate and each time, allows you to draw one quantity and
cast it immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 I t e m
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   All
Item:  Item Scroll
Can't: No items stocked in inventory
       Under Silence, Berserk, Confuse, KO, Petrify, Sleep status
AP:    n/a

Well, as the name suggest, I guess you know what this command allows you
to do. This command is quite important as it allows you to use items 
such as Phoenix Downs [restores Life, which you can't have Life magic
early in the game..], Potions, etc. It also includes items such as 
combat items (or battle items). Examples of combat items are Holy Stone,
Phoenix Pinion, etc. It works like the Magic command as you will be 
brought directly to the Item inventory pages [which you can also 
reorder..] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 C a r d
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Quezacotl
Item:  Gambler's Spirit
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    40 

This command allows you to convert a dying monster into card. Certain
monsters nab you "BOSS" cards such as Elvoret, X-ATM092, etc. The card
command can only be done when the monster's HP is low. The best way is
to use Quistis' Micro Missile, summon Diablos or cast Demi magic and
then use this command. About 1/20 chance, that you get a BOSS card...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 D o o m
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Shiva
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    60

It works like the Sudden Death and at the same time removes bonus magic
effects [Haste, Aura, Triple, Double, etc.] from the character. You will
find a 8 second counter above the monster's head. Once it reach zero, 
the monster is KO'd. Pretty effective against monsters that weak 
against Ice. [e.g. Ruby Dragon and T-Rexaur]. It has also implicit a 
curse status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        M a d    R u s h
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Ifrit, Eden
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    60

It is pretty risky.. The Mad Rush causes you to loses control of the
ENTIRE party. Berserk, Haste, Shell and Protect are being cast on the
entire party. Berserk will still take effect even if the characters
are protected against it through ST-Def-J linked to 100x Berserk. I 
guess it is quite good as if you are desperate...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       T r e a t m e n t
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Siren
Item:  Med Kit
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    100

One of most useful command.. If you don't have the Ribbon or ST-Def-J 
x4, this command is a must. The Treatment command works like Esuna 
except it has a better off ability and that's even the character is 
under Silence, it is still usable! It just removes any negative status
and magical effects. 

Negative status: Sleep, Berserk, Silence, Doom, Curse, Petrify, Confuse,
                 Poison, Blind.
Magical effects: Slow, Stop, Vit 0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             D e f e n d
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Brothers, Cactuar
Item:  Knight's code
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    100

Well, I just can't understand why the characters needed to learn 
defense? I thought that they know it already. In the previous FF series,
every character knows how to defend... Anyway the Defend command only 
works for the particular turn. It allows physical damage dropped to zero
and halves magical damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         D a r k s i d e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Diablos, Doomtrain, Eden
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    100

Quite a good command, if you know how to make use of it. The Darkside
just works like critical attack, doing 3 times more than usual, but
sacrificed 1/10 of the current HP. This command could be a killer with
you make used of Regen or ST-Atk-J linked to 100x Drain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           R e c o v e r
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Leviathan
Item:  Healing Ring
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    200

I guess this is the best command.. This command is quite useful as it
does a full recovery to one character. But beware that this can be also
a move to attack.. It works pretty fine against undead and monsters 
under Zombie status. But it also does a instant dead attack to 
characters under Zombie status. Recover is really a good ability that
you can't miss it. It could saves you a lot of Curagas.. [BTW, Curaga 
is a good magic for boosting Spirit]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             A b s o r b
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Pandemona, Doomtrain
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    100

This command target at one enemy by taking off a bit of HP (about 10% 
of monster's current HP.) But it does not work quite well, if you did 
this on undead monsters, monsters under Zombie status. I guess it is
still quite a useful command, but don't over use it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             R e v i v e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Alexander
Item:  Phoenix Spirit
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    200

The second best command. It does most of the time, resurrect dead ally
back to full health just like Full-Life. About 5% chance, you will see
it restoring Life just like Life magic or Phoenix Down. I guess this 
perhaps effect due to Luck or Magic stats. But I would rather use a
Phoenix Down than this command as it allows the characters to be 
revived but at critical status, hence doing Limit Breaks!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           L V   D o w n
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Tonberry
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    n/a

Well, this aids you to weaken a strong foe but lower it's level and HP.
It also causes a change in the draw list, attributes of the monsters
[Hit Points, Strength, Vitality, Spirit, Magic, Speed, Evade] to drop.
But it also allows you to nab items that can be obtained from it at 
lower levels such as M-Stone Piece. Most of the time, it halves the 
level and attributes. Monster at low levels have lesser skills too. Just
like the pesky Ruby Dragons. But it reduces the experience points 
gained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               L V   U p
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Tonberry
Item:  n/a
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    n/a

The opposite of LV Down. Extremely useful if you want to get third class
magic when your characters' levels are around 30+. But it could also be
dangerous.. but it gives you better magic to draw from, stronger 
monsters, more rare items, more EXP at the same time. I have actually
levelled up Ruby Dragons to level 100 and at the same time, giving Eden
some training. That will help to move Eden to Level 100 at a faster 
rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         K a m i k a z e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Cactuar
Item:  Bomb Spirit
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    100

Under any circumstances, don't ever use this command in a BOSS fight.
Using Kamikaze, may does over 9999 HP damage [about 30,000 HP when 
character's HP is quite high.. about 3 times], but in turn sacrifices
a character. The character can't be revived and only be able to 
revived after the battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             D e v o u r
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   Eden
Item:  Hungry Cookpot
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    n/a

One of most useful commands. It works only against all enemies except
for BOSSES. Devour does an instant dead attack [but with a crappy hit
rate...] and may leads to bonuses or status. It can also help to build
up the characters.. Devour a Ruby Dragon raises all statistics! But
most monsters gives recovery to HP, status ailments or reduce HP! Refer
to Monster List for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           M i n i M o g
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:   n/a
Item:  Mog's Amulet
Can't: Under Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Petrify, KO status
AP:    n/a

Allows you to summon MiniMog where the MiniMog will do the Mog's Dance
which heals all GFs in combat 1,500 HP. Obtainable through 
Pocketstation only.

Party Abilities                                               ffviii_011
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some people just don't bother pay attention to the Basic Tutorial found
in Part I. It explains on how to equip commands, abilities to your 
characters. So refer to Part I, which can also be found at GameFAQs.

Party Abilities works like character abilities except has a party 
effect.. For an example, Enc-None is equipped in one character's 
ability slot. The entire party will not encounter any monsters. But 
you must equip in at least one of the character's ability slot. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       M o v e - F i n d
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:        Siren
Item:       n/a
Prequisite: n/a
AP:         30

Allows you to uncover hidden draw points and save points. It works
well as some of the terrains in the game, looks complicated..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         E n c - H a l f
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:        Diablos
Item:       n/a
Prequisite: n/a
AP:         30

Reduce monster encounter rate by 50% or half. Quite a good ability if
your characters' HP are running low or lack of curative magic, items,
etc. Quite good if you are sick of combat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         E n c - N o n e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:        Diablos
Item:       n/a
Prequisite: Enc-Half
AP:         100

Allows your party do not encounter any enemies. Wow... Quite a good 
ability as it removes random battle status. Allows you to navigate 
around the field smoothly.. It is quite good when solving sub-quests 
such as Obel Lake Mystery or UFO sighting incident. Plus you can 
uncovered a lot of hidden draw points on the world map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               A l e r t
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:        Cerberus
Item:       n/a
Prequisite: n/a
AP:         200

Allows your party never have back attack status. Not much use in battle.
But it is great to use this while doing your quest at Deep Sea Research
Center. Well, I really hate this.. for as in FF7, you can just simply
tap the R2 and L2 and the characters will face the opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       R a r e   I t e m
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFs:        Rare Item
Item:       n/a
Prequisite: n/a
AP:         250

I could say that this ability is quite useful but not apply to finding
Blue Magic items. In effect, it increases the rate of getting rare 
items. For your convience, I have illustrate four good examples:

Name         Defeat                  Defeat (with Rare Item)
Wendigo      Steel Orb (Junk)        Strength Love, Steel Pipe (GF)
Bomb         Bomb Fragment (Junk)    Bomb Spirit (GF)
Bite Bug     M-Stone Piece, Magic    Wizard Stone (Junk)
             Stone (Junk)
Jelleye      Wizard Stone (Junk)     Wizard Stone, Healing Water (Junk)

But just like other abilities, it not necessary nab you GF items 
always, in fact, see the examples on Bite Bug and Jelleye. Therefore
in order to get Power Generator for Blitz, the best is to not equip
Rare Item as it increases the rate of GF Items, ability/ refinement 
items compared to Compatibility items and Blue Magic Items.

Character Abilities                                           ffviii_012
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character Abilities are actually bonuses to combat and junction. They 
allows your characters to have bonus abilities such as Mug and HP +80%.
They are extremely difficult to find as they are rare items and 
therefore you may required to get Bahamut's Rare Item and Mug for 
assistance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP +20%                      GFs: Diablos, Carbuncle, Brothers
AP needed:  60               Does: Maximum HP increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Regen Ring
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HP +20% is quite a good Hit Points booster at the beginning as it could
increase the character's maximum HP by 20%. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP +40%                      GFs: Diablos, Carbuncle, Brothers
AP needed:  120              Does: Maximum HP increased by 40%
Prequisite: HP +20%          Item: Giant's Ring
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HP +40% is really quite a good ability but if you equipped HP +20%, your
character can enjoyed a benefit of HP +60%! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP +80%                      GFs: Diablos, Brothers
AP needed:  200              Does: Maximum HP increased by 80%
Prequisite: HP +40%          Item: Gaea's Ring
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow! Maximum HP increased by 80%! This ability is extremely helpful when 
you need to boost your character's HP to 9999. [which is essential for
BOSS Fights against the Omega..]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Str +20%                     GFs: Ifrit, Pandemona, Shiva
AP needed:  60               Does: Strength increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Strength Love
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A great ability for early in the game. The maximum strength stats that
character can get is 255.. Even if you have gotten Squall to Level 100,
his strength stats is only 170+ at most with 100x Ultima junctioned. 
Therefore this ability is quite critical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Str +40%                     GFs: Ifrit
AP needed:  120              Does: Strength increased by 40%
Prequisite: Str +20%         Item: Power Wrist
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Str +40% is really a good ability and it will be a great booster for the
character's strength! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Str +60%                     GFs: Bahamut
AP needed:  n/a              Does: Strength increased by 60%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Hyper Wrist
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An ability which could makes a character a strong ally. This ability can
increased a huge deal of strength for the character. Let's say if your
character strength stats is 100, you can get 160 strength stats with 
this ability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vit +20%                     GFs: Shiva, Carbuncle
AP needed:  60               Does: Vitality increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Turtle Shell
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember this phrase.. A good attacker must has good defense. Vitality
is critical important against foes such as Ruby Dragon [its breath 
weapon does no elemental damage.. unlike in the Japanese version..]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vit +40%                     GFs: Shiva, Carbuncle
AP needed:  120              Does: Vitality increased by 40%
Prequisite: Vit +20%         Item: Orichalcon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best defense ability that you could get from GFs.. But there is a 
better ability which requires Adamantine. But Vit +40% is really more
than enough. If a monster's strength stats is 255, and the character's
defense is 110, that character will Received 145 points of damage.. 
Realized the importance of Vitality?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vit +60%                     GFs: n/a
AP needed:  n/a              Does: Vitality increased by 60%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Adamantine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vit +60% is an extremely good ability. Vitality is pretty effective, 
but at the meanwhile, pretty hard to get..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mag +20%                     GFs: Quezacotl, Siren, Diablos
AP needed:  60               Does: Magic increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Circlet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite an important ability.. It affects the amount of damage done by 
the character through the Magic command. The higher the magic stats, 
the more damage/healing will be done. Mag +20% is quite a good ability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mag +40%                     GFs: Quezacotl, Siren, Diablos
AP needed:  120              Does: Magic increased by 40%
Prequisite: Mag +20%         Item: Hypno Crown
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a better ability compared to Mag +20%. In my opinion, this ability
is sufficient to provide enough help for good magic users such as Edea,
Selphie and Rinoa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mag +60%                     GFs: Bahamut
AP needed:  n/a              Does: Magic increased by 60%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Royal Crown
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably the best booster for Magic. This ability has a great effect in
turning weak magic users such as Quistis and Zell to good magic users..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spr +20%                     GFs: Shiva, Leviathan, Alexander
AP needed:  60               Does: Spirit increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Rune Armlet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spirit works like Vitality instead it increased defense against Magic.
Spr +20% is quite a good ability for characters with great spirit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spr +40%                     GFs: Shiva, Leviathan
AP needed:  60               Does: Spirit increased by 40%
Prequisite: Spr +20%         Item: Force Armlet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spr +40% is the best ability that the GFs can provide you without any
customization. Spr +40% is more than enough.. but insufficient to reach
the 255 barrier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spr +60%                     GFs: n/a
AP needed:  n/a              Does: Spirit increased by 60%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Magic Armlet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spr +60% is another ability that can Received through modifying GFs.. 
But Spr +60% can be good but it may affect your healing rate 
dramatically..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spd +20%                     GFs: Cerberus, Pandemona
AP needed:  60               Does: Speed increased by 20%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Jet Engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speed is an important factor as it affects the number of turns that you
can used in a battle. Remember that the faster speed, the faster the 
ATB runs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spd +40%                     GFs: Cerberus, Pandemona
AP needed:  60               Does: Speed increased by 40%
Prequisite: Spd +20%         Item: Rocket Engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spd +40% is the best speed booster that you can get in the game. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eva +30%                     GFs: Cactuar, Tonberry
AP needed:  200              Does: Evade increased by 30%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evade increased the probability that your character could dodge an 
attack. But sometimes it also allows your character to dodge magic. In
my opinion, it is nearly impossible to get 255 Eva stats as it is 
impossible unless you have used a gameshark.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luck +50%                    GFs: Cactuar, Tonberry, Eden
AP needed:  200              Does: Luck increased by 50%
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you lucky? It lowers the character's chances of being targetted and
increase the following:
- appearance of GF Odin and Gilgamesh. Phoenix, after your entire party 
  is wiped out [provided that you have Phoenix Pinions in your 
  inventory]
- increase the rate of critical. Seifer's criticals are the easiest to 
  distinguish as you will see a fire swipe instead of a normal swipe.
  Criticals are just like Deathblows in FF7 as only they inflicit more
  damage compared to normal attacks.
- Increase the use of Holy War-Trial, Hero-Trial, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Potion                  GFs: Leviathan, Cactuar, Tonberry
AP needed:  150              Does: uses Potions upon being attacked.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, sometimes this ability do more harm than help.. I was try to get 
a character in critical status as the result, I have used about 50 
Potions... The character will draw out a Potion [can be Mega Potion, X 
Potion, Hi-Potion+, Hi-Potion, Potion+, Potion] this varies in the item
inventory. Your character will use items from the inventory. To prove it
to be more effective, equip Med Data...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Reflect                 GFs: Carbuncle
AP needed:  150              Does: have Reflect cast automatically.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Glow Curtain
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I myself personally don't like Reflect as it only reflect certain 
spells. The character equipped with this ability will have the Reflect
status in the beginning. This status can still be removed from the 
character using Dispel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Haste                   GFs: Cerberus
AP needed:  150              Does: have Haste cast automatically
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Accelerator
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good ability in terms of combat. Having Haste being cast on the 
character (Haste increased 2 times the speed of the character's ATB), 
increased number of turns. Again this status can be removed through 
using Dispel. [Squall was equipped with this when I fought Griever..]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Shell                   GFs: Doomtrain
AP needed:  200              Does: Have Shell cast automatically
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Moon Curtain
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell works like Spirit except it halves damage by magic. Auto Shell is
pretty good against magic-based BOSSES such as Edea, Adel, the
Sorceresses. This status can also be removed through Dispel. Shell is
being cast once you have entered the combat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Protect                 GFs: Bahamut
AP needed:  200              Does: Have Protect cast automatically
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Steel Curtain
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protect works like Vitality except it halves damage by physical attacks.
Auto Protect is pretty good against physical attack monsters such as 
Ultima, Omega, Ruby Dragon's Breath. This status can also be removed
through Dispel. Protect is being cast once you entered the battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expend x2-1                  GFs: Cerberus, Bahamut, Cactuar
AP needed:  250              Does: cast 2 spells for price of 1
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of best abilities you can get from the game. Under Double, your
character will be able to cast two magic (e.g. 2x Cura, 2x Ultima, etc.)
in a row. Now with Expend x2-1, you will be able to cast 2 spells for
the price of one spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expend x3-1                  GFs: Eden
AP needed:  250              Does: cast 3 spells for price of 1
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Three Stars
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of best abilities you can get from the game. Under Triple, your 
character can cast three magic (3x Curaga, 3x Ultima, etc.) in a row.
Now with Expend x3-1, you will be able to cast 3 spells for the price
of one spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mug                          GFs: Diablos, Bahamut
AP needed:  200              Does: steal an item as you attack.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mug is a very important ability in the game as it nabs you important
items such as Power Generators, Steel Pipes, etc. But once an enemy is
mugged, you can't get any items after you have won the battle. It is 
just like a double edged sword. But you will nab in more quantity and 
this based on the character's strength. With the ability equipped, the
character's Attack command will be replaced with Mug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cover                        GFs: Brothers
AP needed:  100              Does: protect ally from attacks.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Knight's Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cover is actually quite a good ability as helps to reduce damage. The
character will went in front of the character with a Defend position 
hence withstand the attack.. But remember that you must make sure that
the character does have any commands used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter                      GFs: Carbuncle
AP needed:  200              Does: counter attack when attacked.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Monk's Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The character will counter with an Attack command when attacked. 
Elem-Atk-J, ST-Atk-J, Mug has effect on the attack. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initiative                   GFs: Pandemona, Tonberry, Cactuar
AP needed:  160              Does: allow character to attack first
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows the equipped character to have a full ATB at the beginning, 
giving him/her the first opportunity to choose command. In terms of 
speed, this really a good ability as I use this, followed summoning GF
Cerberus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Med Data                     GFs: Alexander
AP needed:  200              Does: double usage of healing/support items
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Doc's Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows the equipped character to double the usage of an item. For 
example, a Potion normally healed 200 HP. With this equipped, the 
character uses a Potion but it heals 400 HP! Quite a good ability. As
for X-Potion maybe it works like a Megalixir [not sure..]. Also affects
Hero, Hero-Trial, Holy War-Trial and Holy War.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move HP-Up                   GFs: Tonberry, Cactuar, Bahamut
AP needed:  200              Does: Restore HP by walking.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember Cat's Bell in FF7? This works actually the same as Cat's Bell.
Just walking on the field, you could restore HP by 1 per step. That's
really a good ability when going down the Deep Sea Deposit..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Return Damage                GFs: n/a
AP needed:  n/a              Does: returns 1/4 of damage when attack.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Hundred Needles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A hidden ability. This ability allows the equipped character to do some
counter without physically moving.. When the equipped character is 
attacked by a monster, 1/4 of damage will be returned to that monster
automatically. It does not differ from whether it is physical attack or 
magic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ribbon                       GFs: n/a
AP needed:  n/a              Does: prevents all status abnormality.
Prequisite: n/a              Item: Ribbon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another hidden ability which can be only gotten from Pocketstation. It
works like a ST-Def-J with all status protected. [Blind, Berserk, 
Poison, Sleep, Silence, Confuse, Petrify, Sudden Death, Vit 0, Slow, 
Stop and Curse are all protected.]. It prevents all status abnormality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP Bonus                     GFs: Brothers, Cactuar
AP needed:  100              Does: allows HP +30 for every level up.
Prequisite: HP +80%          Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gains 30 bonus points for Hit Points as character level up. Let's says
the character have 1200 HP at a level of 20. With HP Bonus, the 
character, at Level 100 can have more than 3600 HP [additions are based
the character's normal levelling up.] [applies when equipped]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Str Bonus                    GFs: Ifrit, Cactuar
AP needed:  100              Does: allows Str +1 for every level up.
Prequisite: Str +40%         Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Str Bonus is really a great ability especially for Selphie and Rinoa.
In fact, Squall really needs this in order to get Str 255.. Otherwise
Lion Heart will not be that devastating. For every level up, Str 
increased by 1. [applies when equipped.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vit Bonus                    GFs: Carbuncle, Cactuar
AP needed:  100              Does: allows Vit +1 for every level up.
Prequisite: Vit +40%         Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vit Bonus works just like the previous two bonuses instead it increase
Vit by 1 for every level up [when equipped.] This works when you need 
to get super strong characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mag Bonus                    GFs: Siren, Cactuar
AP needed:  100              Does: allows Mag +1 for every level up.
Prequisite: Mag +40%         Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mag Bonus affects Magic stats. It can allow Quistis to be more effective
in using magic and does more damage. Mag Bonus increases Mag by 1 for 
every level up [applies to when it is equipped.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spr Bonus                    GFs: Leviathan, Cactuar
AP needed:  100              Does: allows Spr +1 for every level up.
Prequisite: Spr +40%         Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spr Bonus affects Spirit stats. Spr Bonus increases Spr by 1 for every
level up [applies when it is equipped.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Junction Abilities                                            ffviii_013
========================================================================
Junction magic to statistics, only causes an improvement in stats. 
However you can equipped Character and Party abilities through the 
ability menu of the Junction screen. All GFs, by default has 2 Ability
slots for you to equip abilities [not used in combat abilities]. However
certain GFs have better junctions such as Ability x3 and Ability x4.

Okay that's a brief introduction to Junction Abilities. Let's get 
started with the list:

Abilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ability x3                  GFs: Diablos, Carbuncle, Cerberus, Alexander

Mug, Str +20%, Rare Item, Counter, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ability x4 has been possessed by the king of GFs, Bahamut. Ability x4
has 4 ability slots [twice the number of slots of a normal GF..] It
allows your characters to have a Mug, Str +40%, Alert, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Junction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Junction is extremely important in FF8. As it could change your 
character dramatically with strong attacking power. Junctioning requires
magic to change its effect dramatically.. The stronger the magic and
more quantity of that magic you have, the better the junction will be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP-J                        GFs: Quezacotl, Ifrit, Brothers, Diablos and
                                 Carbuncle

Prequisite: n/a             Item: Str-J Scroll
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Str-J allows you to junction magic to booster Strength. The stronger the 
magic, the better the junction will be. Strength is critically important
as it affects the amount of damage the character does.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vit-J                       GFs: Quezacotl, Shiva, Carbuncle
AP needed:  50              Does: Allows you to junction magic to Vit
Prequisite: n/a             Item: Vit-J Scroll
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vit-J allows you to junction magic to booster Vitality. The stronger 
the magic, the better the junction will be. Vitality is basically the
character's defence stats. The higher the stats, the less damage the
character will received from physical attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mag-J                       GFs: Quezacotl, Siren, Carbuncle, Leviathan,
                                 Cerberus and Diablos

effect/ draw rate of the character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spr-J                       GFs: Shiva, Brothers, Leviathan, Cerberus
                                 and Alexander.
AP needed:  50              Does: Allows you to junction magic to Spr
Prequisite: n/a             Item: Spr-J Scroll
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spd-J allows you to junction magic to booster Speed/Dexrity. The 
stronger the magic, the better the junction will be. The ATB will be

Prequisite: n/a             Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hit-J allows you to junction magic to booster Hit rate. The stronger 
the magic, the better the junction will be. A higher hit rate reduces 
the rate of misses. Projectile weapons normally carries a better hit
rate compared to normal weapons. Gunblade characters have a perfect hit
rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eva-J                       GFs: Cactuar, Eden
AP needed:  200             Does: Allows you to junction magic to Eva
Prequisite: n/a             Item: Aegis Amulet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eva-J allows you to junction magic to booster Evade. The stronger the

the character will dodge from an attack.

RPGs. In FF8, increase the rate of criticals, defense against status
that are not guarded, appearance of GF Odin and Gilgamesh, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elemental/ Status Junction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not much emphasis in the previous FF series... But in FF8, this is an 
ability that you must know.. Almost all monsters carries an elements and
each carries a different element. Elements are strong against opposite
elements: e.g. Fire is strong against Ice-element monsters. However if 
it is same element, it results no damage.. sometimes even healed the 
monster! Just remember that what element the monster use to attack you,
don't use that element. That's how I figured out Tiamat's weakness. I
have junction 100x Flare to absorb its Dark Flare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elem-Atk-J                  GFs: Quezacotl, Shiva, Ifrit, Brothers, 
                                 Leviathan, Pandemona, Alexander, 
                                 Doomtrain.
AP needed:  160             Does: junction magic to Elem-Atk
Prequisite: all junctions   Item: Elem Atk
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gives your character an attacking element. The more magic is being 
junctioned to it, the better the effect of Junction will be. For 
example, you junction Blizzaga to Elem-Atk-J, you inflicit more damage
on Fire based monsters such as Bombs. But lesser/no damage/ damage 
absorbed against Ice based monsters such as Snow Lions. Refer to 
Monster List for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elem-Def-J                  GFs: Quezacotl, Shiva, Ifrit, Brothers,
                                 Pandemona, Alexander
AP needed: 100              Does: junction magic to Elem-Def
Prequisite: all junctions   Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Opposite of Elem-Atk. Instead have an elemental based weapon, your 
character will have an elemental based armor. The better and more 
quantity of magic you have, the better the junction will be. Certain
magic affects more than one element [e.g. Meteor]. Ultima and Apocalyse
affects all elements.

When using the Attack command, your character will be inflicit the 
junctioned status ailments at the same time. Blind and Sleep are the hot
favourites among all. Drain works well, but it really sucks when you
are fighting against undead and same elemental monster.

Prequisite: n/a            Item: n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the greatest abilities in game. This ability can allow you to
inflict more damage. Remember that Boost is critically important as it
allows you to inflict roughly 3 times more.. You will first needed to
enter the combat and summon a GF (mentioned in "GFs"). Next you will
see a box with the summon attack's name. Hold down SELECT button and 
you will find a Square button [PSX's Square button], the counter says
75. Just tap Square repeatedly and the numbers will rise up! The 
higher the numbers, the stronger the summon will be. But there are 
generally obstacles. A red cross will appear between the summon.. Just
stop and wait for it to disappear. The highest Boost figure you can 
gone is 250 and I myself believed only GF Eden could do it. But it is
possible for other GFs. Provided you have high affection and a turbo
controller. With turbo on, just hold down turbo and watch the number
rises! I can't really tell when the Square is going to appear.. as it
is random.

Menu Abilities                                                ffviii_015
========================================================================
In the main menu, you will find a sub-header called "Ability". At the
beginning of the game, it is greyed-out. But it will become avaliable 
once you have at least mastered one menu ability.

Menu Ability are important as they could turn useless stuffs in 
valuable/ hard-to-find stuffs. But they can be really tedious and time-
consuming. Menu Abilities can only be used while you are not in combat.
Remember the all menu abilities can't be learned else where. Hence 
don't ever eliminate them.

There are many types of meny abilities and here is a unclassified 
group.. I don't know where to put them. Therefore I would called it a
"Miscellaneous Menu Abilities"

Card-Mod-RF                   GFs: Quezacotl

Prequisite: Card, all menu    Item: n/a
            abilties
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Card-Mod-RF is really a good skill as it convert cards into usable 
items. A lot of people dislike the idea of converting rare cards into 
items, but can't be helped for those without a Pocketstation. The 
Pocketstation really aids to nab some of rare items such as Ribbon and
Mog's Amulet which can't be obtained for those who don't owned a 
Pocketstation. Worst of all, even items such as Energy Crystal takes 
such a long time to get. As for the list, refer to card list section

The best method to get them is either through the Pocketstation [if you
owned one..] and the refinement process [non-Pocketstation owners will
have to suffer like me.]

List of Magic                                                 ffviii_s02    
========================================================================
Magic is proved to be rather useful in all FF series. In FF8, you won't
have the Materia System in FF7. But instead you will be able to "draw"
them from sources of magic known as "draw points". Magic does not 
requires MP [Mind Points or Magic Points] anymore. Instead you can 
stocked them up from monsters too. Advance spells can be obtained from
stronger foes. Ability Points, in FF7, is used to level up Materia. 
Whereas in FF8, they are used for GF Abilities. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frequently Asked Questions about Magic
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are frequently asked questions about Magic. Currently, there are
3 questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1:  How to stock magic? ["3-Ways to stock Magic"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Draw command [for more details on Draw, refer to GF Abilities 
section]. You can either stock from the following 2 options:
- draw from a monster [refer to Monsters FAQ, or Monster Bestiary]
- draw from Draw Points [refer to Walkthrough]
The third method is through refinement such as T Mag-RF [refer to
GF Menu Abilities --> Magic Refinement for more details]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:   Where can I get more Aura?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aura is a big headache.. can't be draw from BOSSES, except for
Seifer, during the fight at Lunatic Pandora in Disc 3. The last method
as the remember the "3-ways" to stock magic [refer to the question 
above] is through refinement. You can refine 1x Fury Fragment [defeat
low level Ruby Dragons or mug high levels Blue Dragons] and you can
get 5x Aura per Fury Fragment!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where can I find the Apocalyse?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sad to say, there may not have any other alternate methods beside draw
from the lower part of last BOSS. One method is through Game Shark, and
worst of all, my Game Shark is outdated ^_^;. Still figuring out 
another method. BTW, the method to get the most powerful spells are 
summarized under the Strategies Section against Weapons. Apocalyse is
the strongest booster from all magic. Since you can't get this, then
Ultima will be your best bet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elemental Arts
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing pays off without any work... Elemental Arts is very important 
when comes to magic. 

1. NEVER ever use same-elemental based magic on the same-elemental 
   monsters. It will do not damage on them or they will absorb them [
   in other words, use it to regenerate lost HP]. One good example is 
   using Fire on the Ifrit.
2. Fire-based monsters are basically weak against Cold/Water-based
   spells. This also applies vice-versa.
3. Humans basically are weak against status disorder and Poison. 
   Poison, on the other hand, has no effect on mechanical beasts.
4. Lightning/Water/Cold works best against mechanical beasts. Fire 
   works quite well on Poison-based monsters. Wind works well against 
   flying creatures. [of course, there are some exceptions.] Wind
   is also great against Earth.
5. Holy works best against undead monsters. Healing magic is good 
   example of Holy-elemental spell.
6. The damage inflicts depends solemnly on the Magic attributes of 
   the character. Example, a character with Magic 136 will do more 
   damage than a character will Magic 79 with the same spell. This 
   also effects the drawing of magic spells. The higher the stats, 
   the more benefits the character will do with using magic.
7. This also applies to Magical defense [called Spirit]. You can 
   raises the stats by using sources such as Mag Up and Spr Up.
8. Element magic can sometimes cure your characters.. Just have a
   100x Firaga [must be ultimate class and have 100x of it] and
   junction it to Elem-Def-J. Next just draw any Fire element spell
   and your character will be healed. But not that the healing will
   not be that great if your character has higher Spirit than Magic.

Your characters can only uses Magic through Magic Command. However 
under status ailments such as KO, Petrify, Silence, Sleep, Confuse and
Berserk, the character can't be able to excute the command. There are
certain magic which can be activate by using stones. If you use an 
Aura Stone, it has the same effect as Aura. But stones are only 
avaliable for certain kind of spells.

There are generally five types of magic and they are summarised 
below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status Magic: magic that carries a status ailment.
Element Magic: magic that carries an element
Curative Magic: magic that restores HP
Support Magic: magic that are used to aid your characters in combat
Non Element Magic: attacking magic that carries no element.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Curative Magic                                                ffviii_018
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Curative Magic is extremely important as it aids your character by
restoring HP so that your character could withstand the battle longer.
Curative magic can be also attacking magic against undead. So remember
to remove Zombie status or you are in deep shit!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 C u r e

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extremely strong recovery magic for all allies. Restores fully HP for 
all characters. Only Selphie could use this magic. You can only get 
this, by selecting it randomly through her Slots Limit Break.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               R e g e n 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great curative magic when comes to combat. This magic works extremely 
well when you are battling tough BOSSES. Regen recovers about 5% of the
character's HP per turn [unlike FF7's 1 HP per second..]. Regen, however
can be removed, using Dispel and it will eventually wears off through
time lapse.

Refinement:
1x Mesmerize Blade    -> 20x Regen [Siren's L Mag-RF]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 L i f e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weak life recovery magic. But in my opinion, I would rather use this 
than Full-Life as it allows your characters to unleashes their Limit 
Breaks. Life Magic removes K.O Status and also restores about 10% of
the character's HP. In this way, the character will be definately be in
Critical or Crisis status. Phoenix Downs typically works like Life.

Refinement:
1x Life Ring          -> 20x Life [Siren's L Mag-RF]

Elemental and Status Defense:
100x Life to Elem-Def-J [30% defense against all elements]
100x Life to ST-Def-J [20% defense against Death]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       F u l l - L i f e
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extreme life recovery magic. Full-Life looks extremely alike Raise in
FFT or FF7. Not only removes the K.O Status but also brings the 
character back to full HP. But it does not work that most of the times,
I guess it has something do with the character's Mag stats.

Refinement
1x Regen Ring         -> 20x Full-Life [Siren's L Mag-RF]
1x Phoenix Spirit     -> 100x Full-Life [Siren's L Mag-RF]

Elemental and Status Defense:
100x Full-Life to Elem-Def-J [40% defense against all elements]
100x Full-Life to ST-Def-J [40% defense against Death]

Status Magic                                                  ffviii_020
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status Magic is critically important in FF8. Even though it is puny 
useless in the Final Dungeon [Ultimecia's Castle], it really possesses
a great importance in FF8. Status ailments such as Death, Silence, 
Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, etc are extremely danagerous if they are not 
guarded. Fortunately, there is always a method in removing them. But as
the saying goes, "Prevention is better than cure", you can be protected
against status ailments through ST-Def-J or equipped the secret 
character ability, Ribbon [obtainable through Pocketstation only]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           B e r s e r k
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Causes a character become red-hot and keep on using the Attack command 
once the ATB is full. Berserk can be regarded as support magic, but I
would regard it as status magic as it does not allows you to control the
character. 

Remove through:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A dark cloud of smoke appears around one character's head. Hit rate is
reduce by about 30% to 50%. This status ailment is pretty worthless 
against character's with perfect hit rate such as Squall, Seifer and 
Selphie (provided you have gotten her Strange Vision)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Causes ATB to stop and turns grey. Character turns into stone [or the
term that Squaresoft uses "Petrified"]. Break is another deadly magic as
it could turn an enemy into a rock, hence instantly ended the battle, 
giving you no EXP, AP and items. Once all party members are petrified,
it's gameover.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Causes the characters to turn in circles on the spot. You will lose 
control of that character. That character will attack anyone including
himself/herself and its random. A very dangerous situation when your
strongest character [with highest Str stats] are under "Confuse" status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A devil protudes from the ground and attacks with it deadly spear, hence

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A curse scripting of words and hence a fusion of dark energy gathers...
causing a fixture of status ailments (Silence, Poison and Darkness).
This spell is quite hard to get it, but it is really good as it is only
magic that allows you to inflict three statues at one go.

on magic. So better guard against it.

Scan is typically a form of information seeker. It allows you to see 
information on the targeted foe such as their attributes for strength 
[STR], Intelligence [INT], Dexterity [DEX], defense [DEF], spirit  [SPI] 
and evasion [EVA]. It also gives information on it's weakness and a 
short description of the foe. A sonar appears from the character's body 
and thus focus on the monster with the words "TARGET". This followed
by a detailed information on the stats of the targeted monster. Press 
"Triangle" to cancel this effect. You can turn around the monster while
shown with the screen. You will have this effect for the first time 
round, but you can have it forever, but change "Always" through Config
menu.

A pink globe surrounds one ally, hence increases the character's defense

I would still consider it as good for reducing damage from Meteor and
Ultima.

The most devastating magic in the game. Apocalypse cannot be obtained by

Elemental Junction Attack/Defense
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This chart provides you with the information regarding Elem-Def and Elem
-Atk. Remember that elements are critical important as they could 
increase your characters' attacking power. Even though with a Str stats
of 255, Squall [or any other character] still can't get 9999 HP damage
per attack. The only way to do this by having elements junctioned to
the character's Elem-Atk-J or casting Meltdown to force Vitality to 
drop to zero. In the actual screen, you will not see a 100% at elemental
defense. Instead you will see star replacing it. If the magic gives you
a 150% defense, you will see a 50% at the slot with a green star on the
right. Only 200% elemental defense will give a 100% on the slot and a
star on the right.

* Applies to Elemental Defense only.
Absorption? Yes! As along your characters have a star and prove the 
monster's magic is stronger than your characters' Spirit, you can absorb
the damage, hence healing one's HP. If your characters got 150% 
elemental defense against Water, a monster cast water on it and does 
2000 HP. You will absorb the same damage, plus half of the damage, which
makes 3000 HP. [2000 x 150% = 3000]

* Applies to Elemental Attack only.
You can inflict a lot more with this combo. Let's say if your character
has 255 strength stats and have 100x Firaga to Elem-Atk-J. If you battle
a Snow Lion and your character does 4500 HP without elemental attack. 
With Elemental attack, you character can inflict 4500 x 120%, which 
means 9999 HP attack. I have managed to figure out this, when I first
saw all my character does 9999 HP to the Jumbo Cactuar. But if you use
the same elemental combo [100x Firaga to Elem-Atk-J] on a fire based
monster and your character does 2000 HP damage, he/she will get 
2000 x 120% damage! Be alert when using this..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status Attack/Defense Junction 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status Magic can really be killer when you are battling strong monsters
such as Ruby Dragons, T-Rexaurs, Behemoths, Elynoles, etc. But no matter
how strong they, they will still be effected by status ailments. The 
only area where you could ignore them is during battles against BOSSES 
in the final dungeon at Ultimecia's Castle. The Omega Weapon may be 
invincible as it has an 100x Ultima to Elem-Def-J but still weak 
against status changes [or it will be invincible!]

Support Magic  
These magic are simply damaging as they help in boostering up the 
character's attributes in combat. Protect may looks weak, but it 
actually doubles the character's defense. Of course, in FF8, the most
useful magic will be Aura as it allows your characters to use Limit
Breaks. BTW, they only last for a short period of time.

Magic            Effect
Aura             allows your character to use Limit Breaks more easily.
Haste            doubles the speed of ATB.
Protect          doubles the character's defence
Shell            doubles the character's magical defense
Reflect          reflects certain magic.. [check Magic: Reflect]
Double           allows character to cast two magic in a row.
Triple           allows character to cast three magic in a row
Float            doubles the character's evasion
Regen            restores a portion as the character reaches his/her 
                 turn.
Meltdown         causes opponent's Vitality dropped to zero

* Dispel could remove all the above mentioned magic.

That's all, I have done for the magic section. Let's move on to the
next section

========================================================================
Weapon Remodelling / Limit Breaks.                            ffviii_s03
========================================================================
Weapon Remodelling is very useful [extremely important to the main lead,
Squall Leonhart] as it increases the character's weapon attacking power
and hit rate. In the previous FF series, you can easily buy the weapons
from a weapon shop. But in FF8, you need to do the following in order
to tune up your weapons [or remodel]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 SIMPLE Steps to remodel a weapon:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gathered up the ingredients for the weapons! For those whom are 
   playing for the first time, I would recommend you to get the Weapon
   Monthly manuals. These manuals will give you a detail list of the
   requirements. The manuals will instantly unlock the weapon's name.
   The other way is, by having the required ingredients. Refer to each
   character's section to know where to get the ingredients. I would
   recommend you to check the Monster Bestiary.

2. Next find a Junk Shop.. There are a lot of them. And it does not
   matter which shop you go.. Or you can make use Doomtrain's Call
   Junk Shop Menu Ability [refer to GF Abilities]

   Locations of Junk Shops
   Balamb Junk Shop - left of the screen of the town center. 
   Deling Junk Shop - in the Parade road
   Dollet Junk Shop - found within Noutilus
   FH Junk Shop     - found on the right of town center, cross the 
                      planks
   Esthar Junk Shop - it's Don Juan's Shop!
   Man at Garden    - it's the Card Magician Joker! You will find him
                      at the Training Center (randomly)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hopefully you basically know the menu setup look like. If not, refer
to the diagrams below [this diagram looks indentical to the Junk Shop
menu]:
   ___________________________________________________

  |___________________________________________________|
  |  Squall Leonhart                                  |

  | Steel Pipe    |    Revolver            100        | 
  | 1        (3)  | |> Keer Trigger        200        |
  |               |    Cutting Trigger     400        |
  | Screws        |    Flame Saber         600        |
  | 2        (30) |                                   |
  |               |___________________________________|
  |               | Strength 45%  -> 48%^             |
  |               | Accuracy 255% -> 255%             |
  |_______________|___________________________________|

Well, time for some explainations. The numbers in the brackets are 
those that you have in your ITEM inventory. If the numbers on the left 
exceed the numbers in the brackets, then you will be unable to perform 
an upgrade. 

Just in case, my English is a bit too hard to understand...

      _ _ _ _ _ the name of the ingredient
 ____/_____________
| Adamantine       |
| 1           (0)  |
  |             \_ _ _ _ _ avaliable in your item inventory
  |__ requirements

In this above case, you can't perform an upgrade. The weapon [as you
may guess it's the Lion Heart]. Why, you don't have the item produce an
upgrade. (0) is definately less than 1. It is pretty easy to understand.

If that's not clear, there's nothing I can do...

Note that you can de-graded your weapon back to it's original form, but 
the used materials will be gone forever. If the number 48 is yellow in 
colour, that means there is an increase in attacking power. But if the 
colour of the digits is red, that means that your previous upgraded 
weapon is much better than the weapon you have choosen to upgrade to. 
[For example, Flame Saber is obviously a better weapon compared to the 
Cutting Trigger.]. The numbers next to the name of the weapon is price
to pay in order to remodel them.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE (regarding combats)
You can't get an item from a monster by winning IF you had steal from a 
monster during combat. How to equiped Mug? Refer to Basic Tutorial.

Examples:
1. You fought 2x Adamantoise and you mug one of them [get an item, 
   let's say Whisper for an example.]. You will not get Adamantine 
   even though you have defeat the other one. Adamantine can be ONLY
   obtained if you defeat BOTH Adamantoise and do not mug them!
2. You fought 1x Ruby Dragon and you mug it [get: Inferno Fang] and 
   when you defeat it you get nothing.
3. You fought 1x Ruby Dragon and defeat it. You will mostly get Fury
   Fragment or Inferno Fang [between level 20 ~ 40] or Energy Crystal
   [level 80 and above]

========================================================================
Learning Limit Breaks
========================================================================

In FF7, you learn Limit Breaks by using them. In FF8, individual 
characters have different ways in learning them. Plus, there is no more
Limit Break guages. Typically you need to get them into crisis level.
All characters can use their Limit Breaks once they are in crisis level.

What is Crisis Level? There are a lot of mistakes made by me on this...
All characters has a Limit Break guage just like the characters of FF7,
the only difference is that it is invisible. Limit Guage builds up once
the character is under attack [especially heavy attacks]. As different
characters have different behaviour status. I believe that Seifer could
probably under the Fury status, which explains why he can get his Limit
Breaks so easily..

As your characters are in danger, the coloring of HP will changes from
white to the following colours: (all are based on my own estimation)
- yellow [if character's HP is between 85% to 15% of the maximum HP]
- red [if character's HP is between 1% to 5% of maximum HP]

Once you see this, just do the following below:
 __________   ____________ 
|Attack  |>| |Renzoukuken |   e.g. Squall Leonhart.
|Magic     | |____________|
|GF        | 
|Draw      | You need to hold Right, in order to see the name of the
|__________| character's Limit Break. Different character have 
             different names for their Limit Breaks. Press X to select
             it.

Notes on getting Limit Breaks:
o Use an Aura on the character - refer to magic besitary in getting it.
o Use an Aura Stone on the character - refer to Items in getting it.
o Seifer is an exception of all characters, he can excute his Limit 
  Breaks with the party's HP depleted to 83%.

                   want!
                   If you have problem doing that, level up to level 80
                   and the commonly found Ruby Dragons. [you can 
                   encounter more frequently at hilltops of Esthar.]

Squall Leonhart's Limit Breaks
========================================================================
As the main character will always have the most powerful Limit Breaks,
Squall is no exception. He can inflict as much as 180,000+ damage with
his ultimate Limit Break, Lion Heart. [enough to eliminate any monster 
from the face of the earth..]

Renzoukuken is the name of Squall's Limit Break. Renzoukuken means "
Repetitive Slashes" or "Consecutive Blade" and looks quite like Cloud's
Omnislash of FF7.

As Gunblade is Squall's main attacking weapon, there are two features
in this weapon. Squall could actually trigger his gunblade, giving him
the ability to inflict more damage. To do this, you must trigger his
gunblade, by pressing the R1 button.

Just when Squall is using his Limit Breaks, a guage similar to the
one below, will popped up at the lower screen. 
 ___________________________
|     | X |  _ _ _ _ _      |
|_____|___|_________________|

You will see flashes of light and driving passes the box marked "X", to
do a trigger, just tap R1 when the light reaches the box. You will next
see - - - - being replaced with a number of hits. Someone has told me 
that if you trigger at the box while watching Squall hitting the 
monster will be much easier. If you triggered at the box, Squall can do
a lot more damage compared to a normal attack. The maximum number of 
hits Squall can do, is 7. Normally, you will see a flashing blast at 
the seventh hit. 

Now I first jump to Squall's configuration screen before telling you 
about finishing blows. Here is an ASCII art of the screen.
 ________________________________________  
| Gunblade Auto           | ON   |  OFF  | If you set Gunblade Auto ON,
|_________________________|______|_______| Renzoukuken will be done 
| Renzoukuken Indicator   | ON   |  OFF  | automatically by the 
|_________________________|______|_______| computer. Choosing OFF allows
|Special                                 | you to trigger yourself.
|  Rough Divide        Fated Circle      | The Renzoukuken [ASCII art
|  Blasting Zone       Lion Heart        | above] indictator will be 
|________________________________________| visible if you choose "ON".

About 1/6 chance, you see Squall execute one of his finishing blows. The
chance will depend on Squall's current HP to maximum HP and also his
members' current HP to maximum HP. You will learn new finishing blows, 
by remodel Squall's gunblade into a stronger gunblade. Of course, the
better the gunblade, the better the Limit Break. The advance Limit 
Breaks to be executed varies as depend on the opponent's attributes,
crisis level and luck. A lot of e-mails asking me how to get Lion Heart
Limit Break each time, but it is impossible or Squaresoft will might as 
well have one Limit Break for each gunblade.

/ III \_________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of Finishing Blows 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:        Rough Divide
Description:
This move looks great as Squall uses the move that he has used during
the battle with Seifer at the opening CGI. Squall just glides his 
gunblade across the ground and lift it, thus a blast appears from the
ground.
Area effect: Single opponent
Learnt:      Revolver
Rating:      7/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:        Fated Circle
Description:
After Squall has finished the Renzoukuken, Squall helds his gunblade on 
his shoulders and leap up in mid-air and followed by a quick spin, 
forming sparks of fire on his opponents.
Area effect: All opponents.
Learnt:      Shear Trigger
Rating:      8/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:        Blasting Zone
Description:
Squall held his gunblade vertically upwards and followed by a 
generation of energy surrounding him. Next a beam of light appears from
his gunblade and receives the outer atmosphere of the world, followed
by a deep cut on the ground on all opponents.
Area effect: All opponents.
Learnt:      Flame Saber, Twin Lance, Punishment 
Rating:      9/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:        Lion Heart
Description:
Squall held his gunblade facing downwards followed by a cloud of wind
generating and starts a rushing series of 16x slashes on his opponent
[9999 HP each!]. This is obvious the most damaging attack in FF8! I 
forgot that there is another addition of 9999 HP damage after he has
excuted the Lion Heart! [this depends on Squall's Strength stats and
monster's Vit]
Area effect: Single opponent.
Learnt:      Lion Heart
Rating:      10/10 [actually it deserves more than 10!]

                he was only 13 years old out of admiration of his 
                grandfather, who was an excellent soldier. He is the 
                type who does everything with enthusiasm, but the 
                reason is his weak point. However, at heart he is 
                gentle and has a serious personality.

Zell Dincht's Limit Breaks
========================================================================
Zell's Limit Breaks are just like Tifa of FF7. However, his Limit 
Breaks has much options for you to chain. Zell is really a good player 
as his Limit Breaks allows you to put in more fun in battles. His Limit
Breaks are quite easy to get compared to Squall. You just need to find
items known as Combat King Volumes. Refer to Item Bestiary for the
detailed information about them.

Like Squall, Zell also has finishing blows and they are too damaging.
BTW, Zell also has a status screen where you could set the character's 
Limit Breaks.

Normally, here are the sequences that you see while excuting Zell's
Limit Breaks.

1.  Zell will do his Punch Rush.
2.  Next, a box containing the input of keys will appear. Enter any of
    these combinations before ending of Zell's Rush Fists. E.g. Booya
3.  Now you will unleash the chosen up and chain it again until the time
    has reached 00:00.
4.  Note that you need to chain up within the given time and time will
    flickes. It should looked something like this:

                            Blow

Well, I have summarised in the chart below on how to get the required
Limit Break and the magazine issue needed for the technique. As for 
methods on getting the magazines, refer to Item section

NOTES about Zell's Duel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, the Limit Breaks carries non-elemental damage [Dolphin Blow does
not does Water damage]. Here are some minor descriptions of Zell's other
Limit Breaks:

Punch Rush: Zell rushes forward to an opponent and does a fury of 
            punches. I could say his fighting style is a bit different
            compared to Tifa.
Booya:      Zell waves his hands and followed by a knee jab at one
            opponent.
Heel Drop:  Zell raises his leg and followed by a slashing down heel
            drop against one opponent.
Mach Kick:  Zell turns and does a back turn kick against one enemy,
            the most damage non-finishing blow, Limit Break that you
            could accquired early in the game.
Dolphin  :  Zell raises an uppercut followed by a dolphin rising up..
Blow        Agree with Kao Megura, Squaresoft must be running out of
            ideas... Dolphin Blow does damage to all opponents.
Meteor   :  Most damaging skill against non-BOSS. The Meteor Strike
Strike      removes 1/4 of the monster's current HP. Zell lifted up
            his opponent, followed by an aerial stomp.

There are a lot of combinations which can get you to have new Limit
Breaks. They are quite easy and if you put them into practice, you
could excute them well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using The Armageddon Fist 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Kaze Yagami (yagami@pacific.net.sg)
The Armageddon Fist is done by using Punch Rush and Booya. Some of the
readers say that Heel Drop will be better as it inflicit more damage as
compared to the Booya. You just need to switch between Booya and Rush
Punch and the enemy will be dead meat in no time. As the combo can be
done repeatedly many times, it can accumulated to heavy amount of 
damage.

Quistis Trepe's Limit Breaks
========================================================================
Quistis Trepe perhaps have most well-rounded Limit Breaks as she learn
16 Limit Breaks [err.. correction, Blue Magic]. Her Blue Magic are so
indeed hard to get and it really takes time to get them. But they are
worth it. The Power Generator, which allows Quistis to learn Ray-Bomb
is indeed devasating and you need to take ages just to get it. How? Read
on. 

Once Quistis is ready to use her Limit Breaks, you see the following
diagrams:
 __________  ____________
|Attack |> || Blue Magic |  Just select the Limit Break "Blue Magic"
|Magic     ||____________|  will do the trick ^_^;
|GF        |                You should a lot of Limit Break pages
|Recover   |                shown below. Empty slots will be cover up
|__________|                the next Blue Magic. But they will be 
                            arranged in the following order:
                            
 _____________________________________________________________________

| LV? Death      | Acid           | White Wind     | Raybomb          |
|________________|________________|________________|__________________|

To learn the above 16 Limit Breaks, you must get items [Junk type] 
known as Blue Magic and access through the Item Menu [all other 
characters will be greyed out, so don't worry of giving it to a wrong
character.] Now to get them? Refer to Bestiary below. BTW, Blue Magic

Selphie Tilmitt's Limit Breaks
========================================================================
Selphie's Limit Break is regarded as most powerful Limit that you can
find in the game. But it will reduce the fun that you could possible 
enjoy in the game. The End wipes out everything except for undead and
Ultimecia.. Even Omega and Ultima have the fear on that spell. As the
saying goes "you work for what you get.", quite a piece of bad news
huh? You may take ages just to get her spells. Learning her Limit 
Breaks is unique. You need to get her Limit Breaks during your selection
of spells. 

Executing her Limit Breaks is just others.. You need to get her into
Crisis condition, cast Aura or use Aura Stone, so that she could uses
her Limit Breaks. Once she was be able to use to her Limit Breaks, you
should see something similar below..
  _________   ________
 |Attack |>| | Slots  | Just push right, once you see the triangle. 
 |Magic    | |________| Next press X again and select slots and you
 |GF       |            will have a diagram below:
 |Item     |
 |_________|
   ___________       ___________       ____________
  | Firaga   3|     | Aura    2 |     |Full-Cure 1 | (1) choose
  |           |     |           |     |            |    "Do over"
  |  Do over  | --> |  Do over  | --> | Do over    |
  |   Use     | (1) |   Use     | (1) |   Use      |
  |___________|     |___________|     |____________|

The diagram is NOT exactly the same. It is just an example. You may
take countless time, using "Do over" to get the rare magic spells. 
Those rare spells are her Limit Breaks. You NEED TO use them in order
to Selphie learn her Limit Breaks. Generally there is a trick in 
selecting spells effectively without worrying enemies that is going
to attack your party.

Okay, Selphie can virtually cast any type of spells, including 
Apocalypse, Ultima, Full-Life, Curaga, etc. When you choose to cast
under "Firaga 3x" she will cast Firaga three times and attack any 
enemies at random. What I am trying to say, you will not get the 
chance to cast in the order that you like. 

Anyway, here is the trick in getting spells.
1) First of all get Selphie to critical status or cast Aura/ use Aura
   Stone
2) Tap Circle to change turns, have the next member use a magic and
   meantime return Selphie and have her excute her Limit Break.
3) Before the other member cast the spell, open the Playstation lid
   immediately!
4) The character whom is casting the spell looks freezed.. in her/his
   casting pose. Now you could happily selecting your spells!
5) After finished selecting your desired spells, choose to cast.
6) Close the Playstation Lid and the freezed member will start to 
   cast the spell! And it is followed by Selphie casting her Limit
   Break!

Rinoa Heartilly's Limit Breaks
========================================================================
Rinoa's method of learning Limit Breaks is rather unique too. She learns
new moves by reading Pet Pals Volume. [I guess is giving her dog, Angelo
tutorial on the move.] Of course, Angelo has accquired some of her moves 
initially. Angelo does not only appears when Rinoa is using her Limit
Breaks, also while she is in trouble.

During the space jounery, Rinoa has received her Sorceress powers, and
hence gain a powerful Limit Breaks Angel Wings, or known as "Varly".
This Limit Break increases her Magic to 255! Becomes extremely damaging
while casting spells... But you will lost control of her..

                     |_________|


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rinoa's Limit Break has been classified into three groups and they are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angelo's Limit Break
------------------------------------------------------------------------
These Limit Breaks cannot be using through your command. It appears 
while Rinoa is in trouble. I myself believe that Angelo is the perhaps 
the fourth character and she is in the back row of your party. She will
automatically help Rinoa when her owner is trouble. All of them appears
in random and you need to depend on Luck a lot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Rush
What it does?: 
Angelo counterattacks against one enemy, where Rinoa is under attack 
repetively, whether the attacks are magical or physical.
Area Effect:   Single
Vol needed:    Initial

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Recover
What it does?:
Angelo uses an item to restore HP for any ally, who is in critical 
condition. This might depends on the items you have: E.g. a Hi-Potion+ 
can restores a whoopy 2000. It's always a rounded number. [i.e. 2000,
1000, etc.]
Area Effect:   Single (ally)
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 5

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Reverse
What it does?: 
Angelo revives any wounded character with a Phoenix Down, but not using 
the Phoenix Downs in the inventory. The character will be revived with
1/10 of the HP and still under critical status.
Area Effect:   Single (ally)
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Search
What it does?: 
Angelo sniffs the battlefield (quite amusing while seeing Angelo 
sniffing on snow..) She will then start digging and searching for items
and later gives it to Rinoa. Rinoa then gives Angelo a biscuit. To 
encounted this often, boost Rinoa's Luck through Luck-J and have a 
longer than usual fight. Angelo can get typical and rare items. [e.g.
Tent, Regen Ring, etc.]
Area Effect:   n/a
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limit Breaks: Combine
------------------------------------------------------------------------
These Limit Breaks can be execute directly by using Limit Breaks, just
like using your characters. Rinoa need to get to critical status and she
will be able to execute the Limit Breaks. [or use Aura]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Cannon
What it does?:
Rinoa whistles for Angelo, Angelo goes on her weapon, then Rinoa then 
fires Angelo at all enemies creating an explosion. [like using a sling-
shot] After done with the damage, Rinoa awards Angelo a biscuit. If 
Rinoa's strength is maxed out, then this will damage all enemies for 
9999 HP, making it better than Angelo Strike later in the game. 
Area Effect:   All
Vol needed:    Initial

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Angelo Strike
What it does?:
Angelo jumps in and sniffs an enemy, jumps at it and bites it while 
bringing it into the air, spinning it in a 360 degrees motion, a few 
times and brings the enemy back to the ground. Rinoa then awards Angelo 
with a biscuit. Early in the game this does more damage than Angelo 
Cannon, but if Rinoa's strength is maxed out, then this will only damage 
one enemy for 9999 HP so its worse than Angelo Cannon later in the game 
if Rinoa's strength is maxed out. It also allows you to nab rare items
such as Hero-trial.
Area Effect:   Single
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Invincible Moon
What it does?:
Rinoa summons Angelo and throws a biscuit which Angelo catches with her 
mouth. Next, Angelo jump pass-by the moon  [reminds me of Red XIII of
FF7] and a curtain of white light surrounds the party giving them an 
"Invincible status" The characters will looks like partially transparent
hence having the same effect as a Holy War or Holy War Trial.
 
The Invincible status seems to last longer depending on what level 
Rinoa is at and her Magic stats. During this status, Rinoa can try to do 
Angel Wing (if she had aura or was critical before) but it will "miss" 
since she's stuck on invincible status at first. The Invincible status
may causes all magic to cause a "MISS" except for GF Commands and 
Curative magic (except Regen).
Area Effect:   All (Allies)
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           Wishing Star
What it does/:
Rinoa and Angelo run together as the background of the battle field 
becomes star filled. Shooting stars that are actually Rinoa riding 
Angelo hit all the enemies and it is around 10-20 times. The more speed 
Rinoa has in her stats the more hits this will do and the more strength 
Rinoa has, the more damage each hit will do.
Area Effect:   All
Vol needed:    Pet Pals Vol. 6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rinoa's Limit Break: Angel Wing
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Limit Break which can only be gained in Disc 3 at Ragnarok during the
Space Incident. The Limit Break causes you to lose the control of Rinoa.
But all her stats rises up [especially Magic] and thus doing 3000+ for
Fire.. 9999 HP damage for using Ultima. Like Selphie's Slot, she can 
cast any spells which are not in her inventory. The only difference is
that you can't control and she can only cast a spell once her ATB bar is
full. One more thing to note.. She does not cast Support and Recovery
Magic except for Dispel. Partially resembles Edea, huh?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Age:            18
Sex:            Male
Height:         6'0" [185cm]
Birthdate:      November 24th
Blood Type:     O
Weapon:         Shotgun
Limit Break:    Shot
Initial Weapon: Valiant
Occupation:     SeeD Mercernary (Galbadia)
Description:    A young man, well-liked by women whose strongest point 
                is his marksmanship. A cadet at the Galbadia Garden, he 
                self-styles himself as the "No. 1 gunslinger in the 
                Garden" His shooting arm seems sure and he is the girls' 
                favorite because he is full of confidence. He seems 
                callous to simple men, but in truth, he is unexpectedly 
                sensitive and seems to have a serious personality.

Irvine Kinneas' Limit Breaks
========================================================================
It looks kinda strange for me.. I myself don't think you can get new
Limit Breaks just get his ammo. You must also tune up his weapon in 
order get the new Limit Breaks. His ammo is really easy to get compared
to other characters. His attacks are superbly strong. But they also 
carries a couple of good elementals. In order to use his Limit Breaks,
you must get Ammo. To get stronger or better Ammo, you must have GF 
Ifrit's Ammo-RF to order. Pulse Ammo are the strongest ammo.

| |_______| |  only shoot within that interval. You will stop the

               2) Press Triangle
               3) Timer bar runs out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Normal Ammo
What it does?: Normal Ammo 
Area Effect:   Single 
Comments:      Irvine's basic attacking ammo. You can get this from all
               Item Shops, won during combat. The ammo is quite cheap
               and do a hefty 2000+ damage when Irvine's strength is 255
Learnt:        Normal Shot, Variant 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Shotgun Ammo
What it does?: Ammo that attacks all opponents
Area Effect:   All
Comments:      Shotgun Ammo is pretty useful, compared to Normal Ammo.
               It is only a bit more expensive, yet it does damage to 
               all enemies.
Learnt:        Scattered Shot, Variant
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Dark Ammo
What it does:  Ammo with status changing effect.
Area Effect:   Single
Comments:      Another great ammo that causes a series of status 
               ailments [namely Poison, Darkness, Silence] which is the
               same as to Pain. But it is still consider as a great 
               ammo.
Learnt:        Dark Shot, Ulysses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Fire Ammo
What it does:  Ammo with Fire element
Area Effect:   All
Comments:      This ammo works fine especially monsters that you could
               find in Trabia Continent. It does damage to all enemies
               and carries a Fire element.
Learnt:        Fire Shot, Ulysses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Demolition Ammo
What it does:  Ammo 3 times more powerful than Normal Ammo
Area Effect:   Single
Comments:      A great ammo as you can does a whooping 6000+ damage with
               this ammo, plus this ammo can be brought from a shop, 
               once you accquired GF Tonberry's Familiar.
Learnt:        Canister Shot, Bismarck
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          Fast Ammo
What it does:  Ammo for rapid fire
Area Effect:   Single
Comments:      This ammo has extremely fast shooting fire, fancy turning
               Irvine's shotgun in a machine gun. This ammo is quite 
               easy to get, but it runs out easily. So remember to stock
               them up, once you got the chance.
Learnt:        Quick Shot, Bismarck.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:          AP Ammo
What it does:  Armor-piercing ammo
Area Effect:   Single
Comments:      The second best ammo after Pulse Ammo, rather easy to get
               and only through GF Ifrit's Ammo-RF. AP stands for "Armor
               Piercing" and it can does 9999 HP damage when Irvine has
               255 Strength stats. It has a sensible recharge rate.

Name:          Pulse Ammo
What it does:  Ammo that contains powerful energy
Area Effect:   Single
Comments:      Does 9999 HP damage regardless of Irvine's strength stats
               and enemy's defense. This ammo is extremely dangerous and
               it is also very hard to get. Only rare items such as 
               Power Generator, Energy Crystal, etc allows you to get 
               this.

This is not an item! It is a record book that records everything about
your combat, like the number of monsters that the character kills, how
many times your characters have been KO, etc.

The Battle Meter can be gotten Cid Kramer at the Headmaster Office at
the 3F of Balamb Garden when Squall becomes an official SeeD mercenary.
You need to talk to Cid in order to get this. This is only obtainable
in Disc 1.

In Disc 2, you are need to defeat the Battle Master in 10F of 
D-District Prison [through a card game] to enchance it. The last 
enhancement can only be gotten by defeating CC Group Magician Joker
at the Balamb-Training Center [through a card game] in Disc 2 too.

Here is a summary of the upgrades:

What is a Battle Report?
Typically, it is a summary of your entire party. Like number of steps
that your party have walked, how many battles you have encounter, how
many battles won, and lastly how many battles you have escaped. Also
includes information about cities of the world.

What is a Character Report? 
It's a summary report about your character ranging from Squall to 
Selphie which includes the total number of monsters killed and how many 
times the character has KO'd. Also include fact files about Seifer and
Edea. Also give you important information regarding Limit Breaks, the 4
basic command, how to control your members and learning their Limit
Breaks. Also includes profiles of Dr. Odine, Dobe, etc.

What is a GF Report?
GF Report is pretty similiar compared to the Character Report, except it
reports only about GF like the number of monsters killed also including
the number of times, the GF KO'd. It also includes a detailed besitary
regarding Abilities and list of menu refinements [which I have gotten
from and jointed down under Abilities section.]

That's all about the battle meter. Crucial for those whom are new in
the game.

About Triple Triad and the Cards
Cards are really popular in FF8. You can battle against players in 
cities and towns. They are scattered all over the world. The card game 
was created by a man named Orlan and the game rules are made by him. In 
order to play the card game, you must have at least 5 cards. Of course, 
there may be a question that you would like to ask me: why play the 
card game? It is extremely important for those who do have a 
Pocketstation. Remember that cards are the easiest methods to get rare 
items.

To begin...
You need to get at least 5 cards in order to start an adventure of 
Triple Triad. You can get 7 cards from the Card Spade at the elevator
junction of 2F of Balamb Garden in Disc 1. Just press Square instead of
X to start a card game. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frequently Asked Questions regarding Cards
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the frequently asked questions about cards. There are a total
of 3 questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: How does card game look like?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A:  The objective of the card game is to get as many cards as possible
    to your side. Each player is only allowed to use 5 cards for one
    match of Triple. The card game is being played on the 3x3 board.
    To beat the opponent's card, your card's attributes must be 
    stronger than your opponent's. The primary objective is to use the
    attributes of the card to defeat a defending cards. Cards can't
    change side if they are on the defensive side. The reading of the
    attributes is based on the direction where the opponent's defending
    card was placed. If it is placed at the north, then the north 
    attribute of the card will be taken into account.

    The cards consists of four numbers arranged in diamond shape. The
    attributes varies from 1 to A. Each card consists of a character in
    the game, monsters and even the BOSS. BTW, not forgetting the GFs.
    GFs and Characters cards are considered rare cards as you can only
    get 1 before you reached Disc 4. As for methods on getting them, 
    refer to sections below.

    As you advance in the game, you will get to see advance rules such
    as Same, Plus, Same Wall, etc. All the card rules and trade rules 
    will be discussed in detail in the next few sections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2: How do I remove the Random Rule?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A:  For those whom are new to the game, take some time to read about the
    Card Game under the Tutorial Menu. Remember just as what the Card 
    Queen says, your action affects the region rules. So play card games
    in cities you fancy and does not possess the rule that you want. 
    Balamb area is perhaps the most favourite area as it has only few 
    rules. Just keep on the playing and once the rule is no longer in 
    use for a long time, it will be removed. But I myself like the 
    Random rule, save me troubles for selecting cards. It is a matter 
    of convience ^_^;. Another method is by paying cash to the Card 
    Queen. She will remove the card rules for regions with a lot of 
    rules and add card rules for regions with few rules. But you can't
    change her decision as you wanted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3: What happened when you have gotten all cards?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is nothing much to say... Just a yellow star being marked next to 
the card menu and marksthat you have completed the card game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, if certain questions becoming more frequently asked, I may added
them here.

Getting Cards                                                 ffviii_038
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have at least 5 cards to play a card game. There are no limit
[if you can reach 8020 cards...] that you can keep. You can collect at
least 100 cards for each gene [or type]. There are certain cards that 
are rare to find. But they really worth it as they could complete your
card collection and the same time, nab you great times through 
Quezacotl's Card-Mod RF.

You can get cards through the following methods:
1) Find them or trade for them during your journey. [quite rare]
2) Defeat other card players. [most commonly used]
3) Use the Card Comand. You can get BOSS Cards too. [quite common]
4) Through quests, especially for rare cards [not quite common]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you start to play a Card Game, you will have a prompt of whether to
play the game. Just choose YES and you will see the list of rules and
in addition the game rules and trade rules. You can choose either "Yes"
to continue or "No" to decline.

The former areas such as Balamb, Dollet and Deling will have few rules
unlike rules such as Lunar and Esthar which is rather tedious. So the
best way, is to practice. "Practice makes Perfect!"

The early card rules are very simple. The objective to win the card 
game is have more cards turned blue than your opponent. There are many
trade rules and card rules, which I will be explaining later.

Is there a condition to start a card game? Yes! You must at least 
accquired five cards. If you got more than five cards, you will be 
allowed to choose your own cards or the Random rule is applied in that
region, the computer will does it for you. 

A yellow pyramid, which is actually a dice for the game which 
determines whom will go first. Next you will be allowed to select your
own cards [if Random rule is not avaliable] and should get a screen like
this:
 _________________________
| Name                NUM |
| Geezard              1  | You just need to select the card that you
| Funguar              1  | wished to use and you are needed to pick
| Bite Bug             1  | 5 cards. Just select them, and you will
| Gesper               1  | find them place in your column. To unselect

What the abbreviations means?
Player's Card    - Refer to the cards you could control to play the 
                   game. Remember that you can't take cards that are in
                   your card inventory.

Opponent's Card  - The five cards used by your opponent to challenge 
                   you. Same applies to the opponent, as he/she also 
                   can't take cards that are in his/her inventory. I
                   would assumed that each opponent has infinite number
                   of cards.

#1-#5            - The number of cards found in each players deck. You
                   are allowed to use one card during each time. The 
                   game ends when the nine spots of the board are being 
                   occupied by the cards.

5                - Number of cards, that the player currently 
                   controlled. This feature has another function and it 
                   is actually the SCORE in the card game. To win the 
                   game, you must get a score of 6 and above. The 
                   highest score is 9.

Card Name Showed - During the card game, it shows the NAME of the card, 
                   that you choose to put in to board. And during 
                   special circumstances, they are coloured:
                   Yellow - cards that you have previously owned but 
                            lost
                   Blue   - cards that you haven't gain
                   Grey   - cards that you can't have them as you have
                            gotten 100x.
                   White  - cards that you have gotten and below 100
                            cards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wonder why this card game is called 'Triple Triad'? 
Typically, it's a rectangle board marked with 3 x 3 squares (3 rows and 
3 columns). 

Now I have explained the board, it's time to proceed onto the cards. It 
seems that Elementals have a great deal of importance in the card game 
too. Some cards carries elemental such as the eight basic elements [
Fire, Ice, Thunder, Water, Wind, Earth, Poison and Holy]

Of course, they will be brought into consideration once the Elemental 
rule is added to the card game. Well, forget about the elements for the
time bein., Instead, I will explain the features of a card.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanations about the card itself
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 _____________
|    _______E |    E       - Stands for Elemental of the card. I guess 
| 5 |        ||              you should know by now. The Monsters, BOSS
|2 2|        ||              , GFs and Characters are being represented
| 5 |Picture ||              by the cards.
|   |        ||   Picture  - Picture/drawing of the monster, BOSS, GF
|   |________||              or character. 
|_____________|     5           
                  2   2    - Think these numbers as the attributes for
                    5        the cards. The higher the numbers, the 
                             more powerful the card will be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, the Elemental and Picture does not possess a great importance of 
the card, instead focus on the digits. The higher the digits are, the
more powerful the card will be. The highest number in the game is A and
lowest number is 1. [A stands for 10]

To cover a card, you must attack with the corresponding opposite 
direction. To attack the south of the card, your card's north attributes
must be higher than the attributes of the opponent's south attributes.

      North          The attributes are arranged in this order, right?
West         East    To attack the card, you must focus on the cards
      South          attributes. Now I will explain the rule:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial #1: Turning a Card from opponent to your side.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you get too confused, there is a matter that I must clear. You
can only change the card to your side, while its your turn to place a
card on the board. 

Don't worry if your number is smaller than the card, it will remain 
unchanged, as it isn't the opponent's turn to attack your card. So I
hoped you get it: "CARDS CAN ONLY BE CHANGED UPON ATTACKING!"

                                 Explaination
          A             B        Well, if you have problems with this,
   ____________________________  you will be in deep shit for the entire 
  |       ____  |        ____  | card game. Let's says A is the card of  
  | 5    |    | |   5   |    | | your opponent. You need to place a card 
  |2 [2] | p  | |{3}  A | p  | | on the right of it, to change it to 
  | 5    |____| |   8   |____| | your side. Therefore you must be  
  |             |              | focused on the east attributes (marked
  |_____________|______________| with a []). To change that card, your
                                 card's attributes must be higher than
                                 2, as shown on the left. Therefore as
                                 long the west attributes of your card
                                 (marked with a {}) is higher than 2,
                                 you can turn the card over.

Hint: If you don't understand what the above diagram is trying to say, 
      don't read down. The above information must be fully understood.

The Card Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As every game has a rule, I will try to explains the rules. Squaresoft
had tried to make the card game for interesting by adding some rules.
But I guess some of the rules are just too much...

At the beginning of the card game, you will be given a list of rules. 
Those were be the rules that you need to pay attention to it while 
playing the game. To review the rules. Press Circle while it is your 
turn.

There are many types of rules and I have divided them into two 
categories:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Game Rules: rules that take effect for the game from the beginning
                to the end.
In-Game Rules : rules that take effect while playing the game, like 
                how you are going to attack, and some special rules.
Trade Rules   : How the cards are being traded after the card game has
                ended.

Pre-Game Rules                                                ffviii_039
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Game Rules are rules that take effect for the game from the 
beginning until the end of the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  OPEN   
What it does?: The cards will placed on each players' deck with them
               opened. You can see the player's card, and hence your
               cards can be seen too. 
Comments:      Nothing much. If the OPEN rule is not added, you will 
               see the opponents' card placed at the deck area with 
               the back cover of the card instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  RANDOM 
What it does?: The computer will choose your cards randomnly before the 
               came game started. In other words, you will not be 
               allowed to choose your cards.
Comments:      Pretty damaging when you are weak in using PLUS and SAME
               rule. But if you are expert in them, you can easily 
               defeat your opponents. In my opinion, I think that weak 
               cards [Level 1 ~5 cards] have good attributes for the 
               PLUS and SAME.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  ELEMENTAL 
What it does?: Elemental icons will be placed on the board and the 
               following effect took place:
               - a non-elemental card placed on any element, the
                 attributes will be decreased by 1 [the picture will be
                 covered with a -1] (refer to Fig 4.1)
          
            Figure 4.1: Non-elemental card on an element.
               ________                 __________  
              | A      |               | A   ____ | After being placed
              |3 A     |  normally...  |3 A |- 1 || over an element.
              | 3      |               | 3  |    || A becomes 9, 3 
                                 9         |        becomes 2. hence
                                2 9      <-         make the 
                                 2                  attributes...

               - a Fire elemental card was placed on Ice element, all 
                 the attributes will be decresed by one. (refer to Fig 
                 4.2) Hence, in other words, cards with a different 
                 elemental will have the attributes reduced by 1.
                 
            Figure 4.2: Elemental cards placed on an opposing element
               __________              __________
              | 9    Fire|            | 9   _Fire| After being placed
              |8 6       | normally.. |8 6 |    || on an opposite

                                8         |        attributes will be
                               7 5      <-         reduced by one
                                1
               - a Fire elemental card placed a Fire, all the attributes               
                 will be raised by one! Hence, meaning Elements will 
                 give cards with same elemental a raise of +1. (refer to
                 Fig 4.3)

            Figure 4.3: Elemental cards placed on same element

In-Game Card Rules                                            ffviii_040
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In-Game Rules are rules that take its effects while attackng. Take 
effects as the game start. These rules are deadly as they could cause 
you to lost a game.

Just note that a COMBO is actually a combination of SAME and PLUS.

Name of Rule:   Basic or Default [can't remove this rule]
What it does?:  Attacking card changes defending card to its side if 
                its attacking attributes are higher than the defending
                attributes.
Comments:       If you don't understand this rule, you ought to be 
                shot!

                                 Explaination
          A             B        Well, if you have problems with this,
   ____________________________  you will be in deep shit for the entire 
  |       ____  |        ____  | card game. Let's says A is the card of  
  | 5    |    | |   5   |    | | your opponent. You need to place a card 
  |2 [2] | p  | |{3}  A | p  | | on the right of it, to change it to 
  | 5    |____| |   8   |____| | your side. Therefore you must be  
  |             |              | focused on the east attributes (marked
  |_____________|______________| with a []). To change that card, your
                                 card's attributes must be higher than
                                 2, as shown on the left. Therefore as
                                 long the west attributes of your card
                                 (marked with a {}) is higher than 2,
                                 you can turn the card over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  SAME 
What it does?: Changes the card as long as the attributes of the 
               attacking side are the same, applies to three cards
               involvement.

Figure 4.4: Explaining the SAME Rule

Abbreviations:
*    Attacking card
XX   Spot where the attacking card should be placed.

-b   Defending card B
[]   Attributes to be focused for defending site
{}   Attributes to be focused for attacking site

            ________           To excute a same rule, you must have two
           |   6  -a|          opponent's cards on the board. [the cards    
           | 3   2  |          must be on the board, before your card
           |  [7]   |          is being placed. There are a lot of  
   _______ |________|________  combinations besides the one shown on the 
  |  {7}  |         |   1    | left. In the diagram, all cards will be
  | 5  {3}|    XX   |[3]  6  | changed to the attacking side as the 
  |   4   |  -->    |   4    | North attributes {7} and the East 
  |_____*_|         |______-b| attributes {3} of attacking card are the 
                               same as the south attributes [7] of  
                               Defending card A and the west attributes
           Fig 4.4             [3]of Defending card B. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  PLUS 
What it does?: Changes the card as long as the sum of attacking 
               attributes A against defending attributes A is equal to 
               the sum of attacking attributes B against defending 
               attributes B. [mathematics....]. Applies to three cards
               involvement.

Figure 4.5: Explaining the SAME Rule

Abbreviations:

-a   Defending card A
-b   Defending card B
[]   Attributes to be focused for defending site
{}   Attributes to be focused for attacking site
          ________
         |   1  -a|            This one requires a bit more of
         | 5   5  |            thinking compared to the other rules
         |  [4]   |            Just focus on the bracketed attributes
 ________|________|  _______   as they are involving the rule. Now
|   3    |          |   {5} |  look at the North attributes of the
| 6  [6] |   XX     | {3} 4 |  attacking card and South attributes of
|   3    |      <-- |    4  |  Defending Card A (adding up: {5}+[4]=9).
|______-b|          |______*|  Now divert attention to the next two
                               combinations: West attributes of 
                               Attacking Card and the East attributes 
                               of Defending Card (adding up: {3}+[6]=9).
                               Hence PLUS Rule take effect! All cards 
                               turn to attacking side.
    
   Addition Method:         Subtracting Method:
   {5} + [4] = 9            Defending card sides  [6] - [4] = 2
   {3} + [6] = 9            Attacking card sides  {5} - {3} = 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the Subtracting Method is more recommended?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the first method, you must look for the other cards to know the sum.
This can results to confusion for the game.
Whereas for the second method [subtraction method], you just need to 
subtract the larger number - smaller number and compared with the 
difference of affected attributes [in this case, the south attributes 
(dA) and the east attributes (dB) of the defending cards. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  SAME WALL 
What it does:  Changes the cards as long as the attributes are the same.
               E.g. three card with 3s as its north attributes placed on
               the squares 1, 2 and 3. Cards with "As" in the north will
               turn any cards to their side.

{#} - are numbers in corners/wall of the Triple Triad, must be same 
      numbers, so to accomplished of forming a wall.
[#] - are numbers of the attacker, that must be set to the same side
      of the board in order to defeat the defending cards.

                                           P1       Edea's Card
         
Ether C1 or P1 is put into Battle Area 2, both cards that are already
in the Battle Area, will changes color or being defeated by defeated 
by the attacking C1 or P1, as the top area will be comprises of 3 in
as the north attributes hence forming a "wall".

If Edea's card or any card that it upper north number is "A" and that 
card is put into Square No. 2, all cards will change as it overwrites
every other cards, no matter how high its blocking side even 'A'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  SAME/SAME PLUS 
What it does?: This rule is a combination of SAME and PLUS.

The "Combo Rule" this rule is combination of
            both SAME and PLUS rule. But this time is continuous if effect
            this rule is powerful it can even defeat powerful cards

For an example,

Let's say if C1 is put into Square 7, all the cards (with a letter on
its edge) B, F, E, D and C change into opponent's side. It is a
simultaneous event after C1 attacks B & F [PLUS rule, focus on Square
4 and 8]. Now here is the COMBO sequence!

F's east attributes "5" is greater than E's west attributes "4" and
hence causing it to change color as the opponent. 

Next E's north attributes "3" is greater than D's south attributes "2",
D will also changes its color too. 

Now for the last SAME, D's north attributes "A" is greater than C's
south attributes "9" and the hence the card will also changes like 
others.

This is an excellent card rule as it enables you to combine cards 
using Combo. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Rule:  SUDDEN DEATH 
What it doee?: It will causes the game will continue if the game is tie 
               or Draw until one of the player win. Of course, if no
               SUDDEN DEATH, the game will automatically ends whether 
               it is a DRAW, WIN or LOSE. Note that you will get the
               cards that you have changed to your side during the 
               previous round.

E.g.

After first round...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opponent's Card  |  STATUS     | Player's Card  |  STATUS
 (Initial)       |             | (Initial)      |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Belhelmel        | remains     | Minotaur       | change side.
Chubby Chocobo   | change side | Sacred         | remains
Geezard          | remains     | Bite Bug       | change side
Cockatrice       | remains     | Zell           | remains
Chicobo          | change side | Squall         | remains
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore in the next round, the player will controls Sacred, Zell,
Squall, Chubby Chocobo and Chicobo cards. Minotaur will be under the
opponent's control along with Bite Bug, Belhelmel, Geezard and 
Cockatrice.

Card Game Trade Rules                                         ffviii_041
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each time, you played FF8, you will experience different trade rule, 
based on the people are how subjective in guarding their cards. I have
been experiencing a Trade Rule: One, all time... Until, I have started
out with the Card Queen's Quest. The Card Queen's action typically
affects the trade rule.

ONE:    Winner will be allowed to select one card from the defeated 
        card player's five cards

DIRECT: Remember my explaination on the Sudden Death rule? This rule
        works like that. The players will get the cards that he/she
        has changed to his/her side during the card game. Lost cards
        [cards that changed to the opponent's side] will trade to your
        opponent.

E.g.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player's Cards                 ||                        Opponent's Card
-------------------------------||---------------------------------------
Cactuar        | Change Side   || Angelo           | Change Side
Jumbo Cactuar  | Change Side   || Ruby Dragon      | Remains
Tonberry       | Change Side   || Blue Dragon      | Remains
Ifrit          | Remains       || Hexdragon        | remains
Thurstaevis    | Remains       || Creeps           | remains
-------------------------------||---------------------------------------

Even though you lose..
You will get Ifrit, Thurstaveis and Angelo
Whereas the opponent will get Cactuar, Jumbo Cactuar, Tonberry, 
Hexdragon, Blue Dragon, Hexdragon and Creeps.

DIFF:   Winner receive defeated cards from the loser
        according to the Card Score.

        Card's Score 
        Win  lose        Choose a card 
         7  - 3   = 2    Winner could choose 2 cards
         6  - 4   = 1    Winner could choose 1 card 
         9  - 1   = 4    Winner could choose 4 cards
         8  - 2   = 3    Winner could choose 3 cards

ALL:    Winner will receive all cards from the defeated player

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spreading/ Abolishment Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abolished 
Status: The rule will be removed from the region
Causes: Rule not familiar with region
        Rule is not being used too often.

Spread  
Status: The rule will be added to the region
Causes: Rule is being used too often.
        Player want to add it.

The third method is by paying the Card Queen to add or remove rules.

Card Game Tips                                                ffviii_042
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Understand the rules. If not familiar, test it out and practice! 
    Of course, read the Cards Tutorial or the above sections.
2.  Choose your card wisely if random rule is not implemented. That's
    why Random Rule is great sometimes!
3.  If the rules that you currently use are unfamiliar to other player
    that player also can change the rule that you are currently used. 
4.  Rules also changed according to the number of cards that you 
    currently own. The more cards you have, the rules will become more
    unfavourable to you for the most of the time.
5.  Avoid getting greedy just to defeat another card. Don't try to
    defeat a card and then lost a card game! Focus on the weak ends of
    the cards and take note of the additional rules.
6.  Try to take advantage of controlling the game. Force the opponent to 
    follow you that you want him to be doing.
7.  Avoid exposing the weak side of your card if you don't have the 
    advantage or you don't have another card to recover it.
8.  Take advantage of collecting cards early in the game
9.  Take control of the hot spots Area 2,4,5,6 & 8 if you are 
    offensive.
10. Take control of each corner. If you are a player that loves to 
    use the Combo Rule
11. Take advantage of Elemental Rule these is pretty helpful 
    Eg. If Square #2 and 4 are being placed by element of Fire and 
        Water. You can put your card at Square 1 for defensive side.
        as the Elements act as a barrier.
12. If you are winning too much because of the rule that you used
    that player also can prevent you of using the same rule.
13. Sometimes it needs a little luck to win the game. Therefore, good 
    luck in playing.
14. If you are weak in calculations, have a calculator or use the
    subtraction method.
15. If you have forgetten the rule, just press Circle to view the 
    rules again.
16. The Card rules remover trick! You can remove any card rules by 
    having a card game with the man at Balamb Dock. You will be able to
    remove the rule as he will mentions by let's play with Balamb rules
    along with his hometown rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rare card means a card that there is only one of its kind [as for my
assumption for the 2nd rare card, forget about it. I will be discussing
about it later.] But they are extremely tough to get, requires long 
hours of game play. Getting them is really a tough work. BTW, if you
don't want to collect in Disc 1 ~ 3, you can get them all in Disc 4! But
make sure you have challenged the CC Group in Disc 2 or Disc 3 in Balamb
Garden.

      Card King in Balamb Garden, aka. complete the card quests.

Summary
Now defeating Great Sorceress of the past, you will be brought to the 
huge chain. The chain leads to the Ultemicia's Castle, the final dungeon
of the game. Next you will find three doors on the left. Just proceed on
to the top-left hand door [press X while facing it from the chain to 
jump onto the ledge.] You will reach the shores of the Great Grandidi
Forests [Actually, it is a world map location name for it.] The entire
forests is the Grandidi Forests. Inside this forest, you will face the
strongest foes of all time ranging from Mesmerize to Malboros! Just 
equip GF Diablos' Enc None to avoid the random battles. Note that the 
Chocobo Holy Region is located northwest from here. Board the Chocobo 
and use to get out of the forests. Proceed eastwards and down the shores
on the right side of Esthar Continent. Note that Chocobos can cross 
shallow waters. Proceed on until you have reached the Centra Continent-
Khashabald Desert. There you will find the Ragnarok there along with the
fourth door to the great chain. Board Ragnarok, press Circle and hold
down Triangle... You should have a sequence where Squall and company 
meets up the CC Group Heart, Xu. Now you will be play the card game with
the CC Group Members. They have all the rare cards. Note that you can 
only complete your collection once. I.e. Once you have the Ifrit's Card, 
the CC Group Members do not use the Ifrit's Card. Refer to Disc 4 
walkthrough for Part I.

Wonder why I haven't made a update over the past few weeks? That is
due to this section. It was really pain taking compared to other 
sections, which has took me only a mere few days to complete them. The
Item Bestiary has been messed up with Markweb. Anyway, I have managed
to complete and "repair" a portion of them. Hopefully, that they are
still easy read.

I have managed to break them in to several categories, just to make it
more readable. As one of the readers say that he really experience 
problems in finding information regarding to the items that he want to
know about. Therefore, I have also embedded the searching for the item
list.

Just use the Find option from the toolbar of Wordpad and enter 
"item_xxx" under the Find field. Just replace the xxx with the 3 digit 
code number for that item. Hence, happy searching!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items possess a great importance as they allows you to restore HP and
MP for the past FF series. But in FF8, even though, you no longer 
required MP you still need them as they possess great importance, 
regardless of getting items, completing quests and perhaps It aids you 
to past through the game smoothly.

Notes about Medicine Group
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medicine Group can be used from the field or battle [through Item 
command]. They can't be used when the character is under Silence 
status. Most Medicine Group can be gotten through buying from Item 
Shops. You can get rare items such as Mega Potion, Mega Phoenix, Elixir
if you have accquired GF Tonberry's Familiar ability. Items labelled 
with "+" can only be obtained through Pocketstation or Alexander's Med
LV Up. The main refinement abilities that allows you to get these 
items are the following:

: Siren's ST Med-RF (requires 30 AP)
: Alexander's Med LV Up (requires 120 AP and Med Data [200 AP])
: Carbuncle's Recov Med-RF (requires 30 AP)

And of course, you can get most of them through shopping and it will be
your loss with GF Tonberry and the four great menu abilities [Call Item
Shop, Haggle, Sell-High and Familiar]

Medicine Item Besitary
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes about medicine items:
- You must give the character at least one GF with Item command. Equip
  Item command to use items.
- Healing items such as Potion and Hi-Potion restores a fixed amount of
  HP unlike healing spells such as Cure/Cura/Curaga. There is no item
  that regenerate HP like Regen.
- You can get items via mugging, item refinement, buying from shops with
  advance abilities such as Familiar, which can be gotten from Tonberry.
- Items can be used as weapons too. For example, since healing items
  reduces HP of undead monsters, it can be used a weapon. Phoenix Downs
  is instant death attack against Undead. 
- Items have no effect on KO'd characters, exceptions are Mega Phoenix
  and Phoenix Downs.

Notes on Battle Items Group
------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the items that are usable in combat. [it really sucks 
compared to FF7 where you can uses items such as Grenade, Right Arm, 
etc.] These items are rather hard to get as they can't be obtained 
through the battles (except for BOSS fights) and the best method is 
either through the Pocketstation / refinement. Here are some of the 
important refinement abilities:

Alexander's Med LV Up [120 AP, requires Med Data (200 AP)]
Siren's Tool-RF [30 AP]

Except for the Magical Lamp and Solomon's Ring, the remainder can be 
used repetitive [as long you have them stocked in the items inventory]
Magical Lamp allows you to obtain Diablos (refer to GF bestiary)
Solmon's Ring allows you to obtain Doomtrain (refer to GF bestiary)

Hero-trial and Friendship is only obtainable through the Pocketstation. 
The remainding items can be obtained through refinement, completing 
quests, modified your cards into Items, etc.

Like characters, GFs needs items to restores HP and the items are known
as GF recovery items. Although GFs have auto-walk and recover, they 
still requires these items as they provide more effective healing. 
G-Returners are commonly won by defeating most GFs while in Disc 1.

You can get most of these through Leviathan's GFRecov Med-RF [30 AP]. 
G-Mega Potions are generally the best items for GFs, unlike Elixir and
Megalixir for your characters.

Function:   Allows GF to forget an ability
Card Mod:   n/a

* You can buy this from all Pet Shops. Extremely important when you want
  to customize your GFs.
* Notes on Amnesia Greens: Amnesia Greens are used to remove unwanted 
  abilities. For example, you want a GF to learn Str +60% but the GF
  ability slots is being fully occupied. Amnesia Greens allows you to 
  remove BUT BE CAUTION when using it. Once an ability is removed, you
  can't get it back any more. 
* Please wait for the GFs to master all its Ability before you use this
  item. Let's says Alexander has gotten 21 of 22 abilities through the
  initial ability list. The only ability that has not been uncovered is
  the Med LV Up Menu Ability. You need to wait to master its prequisite
  Med Data before you can learn this. If the slot is being replaced by
  another ability let's says Str +60%, Alexander can't have additional 
  space for Med LV Up, hence Alexander can't learn Med LV Up. Therefore,
  it highly recommended that you can all the 22 initial abilities before
  modifying them. If you have made the above mistake, use Amnesia Greens
  to remove any ability except for its prequisite. After doing this, 
  check the menu and Med LV Up should appear on the ability list.

GFs can be customized by using these items known as ability items. They
normally are hard to find as you required the Rare Item to get them.
The most powerful ones such as Samnatha Soul can only be obtained 
through refinement known as GFAbl Med-RF from GF Eden. 
 _ _
 | |        It should look like the ASCII Art on the left. It also 
/G F\       applies to GF Medicine Items.

GFs can have only a maximum of 22 Abilities. The first time you got the
GFs, only about 75% of GF Ability screen are filled and the list has 
left out a lot of them. Note that GFs requires additional slots to learn 
advance abilities from its prequisite abilities. Example: GF needs to 
learn SumMag +10% in order to get its prequisite SumMag +20%. There are 
a lot of abilities and also includes the rarely find abilities such as 
Ribbon (via Pocketstation only) and Hundred Needles [allows GFs to 
learn Damage Return]. Mog's Amulet [allows GFs to learn MiniMog] is 
also another item that can be only obtained from Pocketstation.

Once you have gotten the item, it does not mean that you can use that
ability. Instead they must be learnt. You may required to use Amnesia
Greens which can be brought from all Pet Shops to forget abilities. 
Next replace the empty slot with the item that allows GF to learn the
ability. Note that GFs can't have duplicated abilities such as 2x 
SumMag +10%. Once the item is used, the GFs will takes no AP to learn
it as it is automatically learnt.

C. GF Compatibility Items                                     ffviii_053
........................................................................

First of all, compatibility is really an important term in FF8. It 
determines how well the GFs co-operate with the character [as you see,
GFs are also monsters..]. The higher the compatibility, the better the
team work. I would always to try to get high compatibility with 
Cerberus for I always keep on summoning Cerberus. These compatibility
items are quite easy to get except for Shaman Stone and LuvLuv G.

get. Imagine refine 10x Hyper Wrist [10x Power Wrist to get only one of 
these..] to get 1x Str Up. But the effects are quite good. And they can
be rather easy once you have gotten as many gil and intensive purcashing
of items such as Hypno Crown, Power Wrist with Familiar at Esthar Pet
Shop. But they definately worth the effort. You can also get bonuses 
through Eden's Devour command.

Monster List                                                  ffviii_s06
========================================================================
Typically, the information that found all here are taken from my precise
Monsters FAQ. However, some of the Devour status are still not added. 
First of all, here is a briefing about monsters:

As in almost all RPGs (it stands for Role Playing Games for those whom
still do not know...), there is always good guys and the bad guys. I 
have been serving the web and found that most sites tends to focus on
the characters more that the monsters. [of course, there are some
exceptions.] Monsters played a vital role in RPGs as they contribute
the fun for your battles. Here is basic facts about monsters in FF8.

- The monsters don't just disappear, in fact there are some "dying"
  sequences... [e.g. Defeat the T-Rexaur does not causes it to 
  disappear instantly [except for ST-Atk-J with 100x Death], it will 
  groan and fall onto the ground [negative response: Yummy, we will be
  having Dino meat for dinner.. :)]

- The monsters does not allow you to get fixed EXP. This is one big
  problem, I have yet to solve. The monster does not give fixed EXP. 
  In fact, you can gain 1,000+ EXP from a monster that nabs you only
  about 600 EXP (want to know how? read on..). The longer the battle,
  the higher EXP you will received. The higher the Level of the 
  monster, the more EXP you will received. The last person to kill
  a monster will normally gets the most EXP. However the AP, you could
  gain from a monster is fixed. (well how about the most AP?, read 
  on..). Monsters at different levels nabs you different items. So take 
  note. AP allows GFs to learn new abilities such as Str +20%.

- Monsters do level up in FF8.. They will gain additional moves, like
  for example the T-Rexaur will have a special attack that grab your
  character and swing the character into the air. [which only appears 
  when the T-Rexaur is Level 100).

- There is no Morph Command. Well, you can't get additional items by
  morphing monsters as there is no Morph Command in FF8. Instead they
  have replaced with Rare Item Ability. There is no more Steal command
  too, which has instantly replaced with the Mug Command.

- Random Draw List. Well, the Draw Command allows you to draw magic
  from the monsters and stock it for your own usage (which means no more
  MP!). The draw list is random... for example:

  Bite Bug                            
  Level 1 ~ 15    Draw: Fire, Scan    
  Level 16 ~ 35   Draw: Fira, Scan    
  Level 36 ~ 100  Draw: Firaga, Scan

  Ruby Dragon
  Level 1 ~ 15    Draw: Fire, Aero
  Level 16 ~ 35   Draw: Fira, Aero
  Level 36 ~ 100  Draw: Firaga, Tornado, Flare, Meteor

- Cash (Gil) Problem. A lot of e-mails I have received asked me how to
  get gil as they can't get gil by defeating monsters. Yeah, that's 
  true! You can only get gil by walking through your SeeD Level. That's
  the way that SeeDs get their salaries. Need to take tests [*sigh*, 
  school is already killing me, yet still need to take SeeD test..]. 
  There is an alternate way but you must have some cash inside your 
  inventory before you can do so. 

- Some monsters return from the previous FF Series. For example, Bomb
  has return from FF Tactics and Tonberry has return from FF VII. Well,
  as for characters, there seems to be no methods have been proven 
  correct. Besides the methods that I have found, are a bit too 
  impossible.

- Don't expect monster's HP to be so restrained... Yeah it is true. For
  example the Ruby Dragon has massive amount of HP (89,100 HP!) at a 
  level 100! Well now you can expect of the BOSSES in the later game.
  FF8's Difficulty arises from here..

- There are three basic status of fighting and here they are:

1 Chance for first strike! - All your character's ATB will be at its
                             maximum.
2 Struck First! - All monsters will have their command first.
3 Back Attacked! - 1) Your characters will have their backs facing the
                      monsters.. Monsters will have their command first.
                      Equip GF Cerberus' Alert to prevent this.
                   2) Your characters will be facing the monsters' back,
                      well don't be fooled by the Imp ^_^; Initative
                      fall into your character's hands.

- Most monsters have cards except for certain monsters such as GIM-52A
  (purple robots found D-District Prison), Raldo (remember those stone
  like monsters that you face at the training center where you encounter
  Ellone for the 2nd time?) and others. 

- The bird's nest story from FF VII is back.. During Obel Lake's Quest,
  you need to look for the stones right? There is one stone that is 
  found inside the nest which leads to an instant battle against the
  Thrustaevis. For FF VII, you will face a giant ostrich at Corel Mt.
  which is the mother of the chicks and get you 10x Phoenix Downs. I
  have finally solved the Obel Lake which I will reveal in Part II.

- Not all precious items can be gotten from monsters. For example, to
  get Glow Curtain, you can't get it by defeating monsters. Instead,
  you can get this by converting 100x Malboro's Tentacle into through 
  Eden's GF Abl Med-RF. But you wonder how I get 100x Malboro
  Tentacle? Malboro are so tough.. therefore this FAQ comes handy.
  This is another reason why I make this FAQ.

- Conditions for Game Over (these words may seem....)
  - All character's HP drop to 0.
  - All characters are under Petrify status.

- When a monster is being pertified, you will Received 0 EXP but still
  recieves its AP. The most EXP you can get, are from the monsters found
  in the Island closest to Hell/Heaven. The least EXP are from the 
  Cactaurs and Level 1 monsters (through Lv Down). 

- You can get a ripped part of the EXP gained if you wounded the monster
  in the battle from running away [hold R2 and L2]. You can also get some
  items if the battle consist of more than one enemy and you have 
  defeated the monster. Example: Vysage usually appears with Lefty and
  Righty. If you defeat Vysage and run away, you will get the items [
  Lightweights or Wizard Stones].

- There are draw points on the World of FF8 and it is your interest to
  get them all. Most of the quests such as the Obel Lake Mystery and
  Elabeak Peninsula Mystery can only be done on the World Map. I would
  also like to express my thanks to those whom have helped me in solving
  the mystery.

- More battle combats.. You can get to do all sorts of new commands such
  as Revive [which is equalvent to Full-life], Recover [which is 
  equalvent to Full-cure], Devour [instant death attack against one foe
  and may gain bonuses/damage] and much more. So it will be your 
  interest to test them out...

- List of Status Ailments in Battles
  I think it will be necessary to mentioned them..
  
  Sleep      A "ZZZ" appears on the character, ATB stops moving.
  Doom       A red counter of 24 seconds [basketball?], when it drops to
             zero, the character will be instantly killed.
  Petrify    A white counter of 20 seconds, when it drops to zero, the
             character will be petrified [turned into stone..] and will
             be unusable if not cured.
  Confuse    The character will be turning around in circles.. ATB still
             moves as normal, but auto-attack commands will be selected.
             May does damage to oneself, enemy and even allies.
  Silence    A speech bubble with "....". Character is unable to use
             Magic, GF and Draw Command. GF-type Commands (Recover, 
             Treatment, Revive, etc) will still be usable.
  Darkness   A black cloud surrounds the head of a character. Hit rate
             reduce by half.
  Zombie     The colour of the character turns dull green except for the
             weapons. Becomes undead [Received damage from healing 
             elements.]
  Berserk    Character becomes red hot. ATB moves normally but as it 
             reaches the character's turn, the character does an auto-
             attack to one.
  Poison     A green cloud appears. ATB moves normally but as you 
             excute a command, the HP drops by a small portion. 

  To counter these, I guess you should all know by now.. if not, feel
  free to contact me.

- In the previous FF series, FF7 and FFT, there are not much emphasis on
  the Elemental Arts. In fact, now they have possess a greater 
  importance as it allows your character to boost to its optimum 
  attacking power. In my own opinion, I think that Elem-Atk-J can be 
  very damaging if you know how to use it. Like I managed to does 9999 
  HP to the Jumbo Cactaur each time.. Refer to the strategies for more
  details.

^ Notes on the attack list
Monster also get new attacks when they level up same as your characters.
One major difference from FF8 between other RPGs, is that the monster
too also get Level Ups and have more HP at a higher level. Usually the
key factor that causes this will be Squall's Level. To fix this, uses
Tonberry's LV Down. At lower levels, you will see the monster using that
tactic. Attacks are being enclosed in the brackets are names that I 
think of it myself. [quite creative, huh?]. The monster also uses 
spells, just BOSSES, some of them even use Blue Magic Items...

' Notes on Item Drop
You can get better items by equiped the Party Ability, Rare Item which
can be obtained from GF Bahamut. Most of the time, you will get GF 
items than Junk Items with this ability equiped. So make full use of 
this. You can less better items, if you perform LV Down or LV Up. 
Below is a slight scenario.. 

Bite Bug 
Level 1 ~ 10    M-Stone Piece [draw list: Fire, Scan]
Level 11 ~ 25   Magic Stone   [draw list: Fira, Scan]
Level 26 ~ 100  Wizard Stone  [draw list: Firaga, Scan]

NOTE: Rare Item does not mean that you will get the item always.
Without Rare Item, you can also get rare items. The Rare Item only
helps to increase the success rate. Piss.. really have a hard time to
get the Devour status.. 

One more thing about this.. You can only get items from a monster if
you did not use the Mug Command. So it is like a double-edged sword..

* Notes about the Draw List
Here is the explaination. As you see, whenever monsters level up, you 
will get new spells such as Firaga, Tornado, Curaga, etc. This spells 
can be obtained from strong foes. For those whom want to take a short
cut, you can get them by using the Tonberry's LV Up and you will get
new spells. Refer to Guardian Force Section found in Part II for more 
details.

Situation #1
Fire* - this denotes that you can draw.. (it is not 100% accurate, it is
        just an estimation.)
        -> Fire from Level 1 ~15 Monsters
        -> Fira from Level 16 ~ 35 Monsters
        -> Firaga from Level 36 and above Monsters

Situation #2
[Death] - this denotes that you will get this new spell as the monster
          has gain its level.
          [Death]- you can draw Death from the monster from Level 16 
                   onwards, but can't below Level 16.
          {Death}- you can draw Death from the monster from Level 36
                   onwards, but can't below Level 36.

Situation #3
{Scan -> Dispel}- this denotes a spell replacement..
          [Scan -> Dispel]- you will draw Dispel instead of Scan from
          a monster that is Level 16 onwards, but could only draw Scan
          from the same monster below Level 16.
          {Scan -> Dispel}- you will draw Dispel instead of Scan from
          a monster that is Level 36 onwards, but could only draw Scan
          from the same monster below Level 16.

Upon your jounery to Lunar Base, Rinoa (possessed by the future witch 
Ultimecia) has freed the Adel (whom is sealed inside the ice chamber..),
which causes the Lunar Cry which struck several years ago to occur once
again. From the "Realm of Evil", the Lunatic Pandora (which has settled
at the Tears Point), absorbs the energy of evil, thus causing the 
following areas become infested with more powerful, devil-looking 
monsters. The Lunar Cry has occured once and it forms the Centra Crater
where you find the Centra Ruins.

Esthar City (the streets of Giant Esthar City) It is on the World Map
View.

/ "Ultima Weapon Quest" Disc 3 onwards \________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah.. the Ultima Weapon is back from FF7.. This Weapon is far one of 
the strongest in FF8. This weapon has a couple of damaging attacks. It's
Light Pillar is indeed a killer (well, Irvine at Level 100 is more a
killer ^_^;). After getting GF Bahamut at the Deep Sea Research Center,
you will see a hole down the path.. this leads to the basement where 
Squall can gain access to the Deep Sea Deposit. You need make use of the
Reserve Steam Pressure to reduce the crystal that is encovering the 
Ultima Weapon. Just have Zell, in the party. Head down to the hole. 
Examine the steam machine located on the left and you will have a short
briefing about the scenario. Just do in 2-2-1-1 RSP usage and have Zell
to handle the last steam machine (refer to Part II for more details). 
Upon that you will be able to access to the Deep Sea Deposit and a whole
hell of them are awaiting for you...

Sub Quests                                                    ffviii_s07
========================================================================
As we know, a RPG has always a lot of hidden secrets. In fact, they will
always nab you some rare items and additional information regarding the
game. In FF8, the toughest quests is the Obel Lake Mystery which is very
tough to solve as you need to do it on the World Map. As for other sub-
quests such as UFO Sighting Incident, they are pretty amusing and funny.
In this section, you will find most of the subquests which extracted 
from Part I. Except that I have added more information for certain 
quests.

Timber Maniacs                                                ffviii_067
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Timber Maniacs are actually articles written by Sir Laguna [well, he
deserves that address...] while he was a jounralist. The articles are
practically written about his life travelling across the world with his
pals, Kiros and Ward. Every articles have screenshots of the 
surroundings. The articles provide information about Laguna's past and
of course the answers for your thrust.

In Timber, there is a Timber Maniacs [not a magazine, but a building]
where there is a reporter that tells Squall about his hallucinations.
That's actually the place where Laguna has worked previously. 

You can't access these through the Item menu, instead you need to head 
to Balamb Garden Network where Selphie will translate them into the 
computer under Sir Laguna's Page. Also includes Selphie's comments 
^_^;. BTW, the Diary also explains your actions.. The actions that are
closer to the story, the better your SeeD ranking is. You still can 
get back to Balamb Garden at Disc 3 after you have gotten Ragnarok. It
is docked somewhere at FH.

Enough babbling, here is the list of Timber Maniacs.
1. Balamb Hotel. Just proceed up the stairs and get it from the table.
   Not necessary to foot the bill to enter the room ^_^;
2. Timber Hotel. There are two methods. You can get this only after 
   Galbadians have left the town. The first method needs you to pay 
   100 gil to rent the room. The second method is go near the train
   tracks where you find the house with Owl's Tears... you will 
   eventually ended up at the Hotel room. It is near the table.
3. Timber Maniacs of Timber. The building on the left of the Forest
   Fox's House. Enter the room in the north and proceed right to get
   the magazine
4. Deling City. Inside Galbadia Hotel, pay 100 gil to the clerk at the
   counter and you will find it under the bed. [not during Laguna's
   quiet momments with Julia...]
5. Dollet. Just proceed to Pub's 2nd Floor and you will find in near
   the pool (billard) table.
6. Dollet. Proceed the Dollet Hotel (north from Dollet's Pub). Pay 
   100 gil and get the Timber Maniacs.
7. Fisherman's Horizons. You will find it at the house of Grease 
   Monkey [remember the huge compound?]
8. Fisherman's Horizons. Just proceed back to main city and you will
   find drunkard not blocking you anymore. You can actually enter the
   building where you could find FH Hotel [need pay 100 gil, or free
   of charge if doing Master Fisherman's Quest.]
9. Trabia Garden. Proceed to the Grave Yard found on the right of
   Gargoyle. Next search within the tombs.
10.Shumi Village: Proceed to the Shumi Village [found in northern 
   continent] and head to Artisan's House. It is found on the bed.
11.Edea's House. It is on the floor before you meet Edea and Cid at the
   backyard.
12.White SeeD's Ship. Refer to Walkthrough for its location. Proceed to
   the bridge (found at the upper deck) and find it on the floor. You 
   can returned back to the ship as long as you haven't taken Rinoa to
   FH..

For your convience, I have arranged them according to the game sequence.
But you still get them as long as you are still in Disc 3 before you 
proceed to the Luantic Pandora. As for the contents, I would not be 
bothered to type them out as they will spoil the game (definately..), 
So you need to read them...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Gysahl Greens, 1x Phoenix Pinion, 1x Holy Stone
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's still a peaceful and quiet town.. Just like in the past. Generally,
there are changes made as the winding path has been concreted and the
truck is no longer there. Now before heading the Mansion, head for the
street where you find the caution sign. It's the chocobo theme!

Getting 1x Phoenix Pinion and 1x Gysahl Greens.
There is small, tiny chocobo walking from right to left. Just press X to 
kick it... Next you will find a green feather item arises from the top.
Pick it up and it will says Vase Piece [even though that it does not
add up to your item inventory]. Kick it once more and it will drop a
Gysahl Greens followed by the Phoenix Pinion (this one is a bit 
special.. when you pick it up from the ground, it says Phoenix Down, 
but when you check the Item inventory, you will find a Phoenix Pinion!
... and lastly, try it yourself!

Now it is time for another key quest. The Vase Piece Quest.
Just head to the mansion, remember the big building that was formerly
guarded by Galbadia Soldiers? Enter the mansion and walk up the stairs..
Talk to the man wearing a grey suit [he was the owner and wants you to
find him 4x Vase Piece..] You have already found 1 already..

Vase Piece no. 2
At:  In the same building
How: Head for the statue [which is actually a holding pole for armors]
     Examine the statue (can only be done after talking with the owner.]
     Now a crash will occur.. a chicobo runs out and leaving a Vase 
     Piece. You need to talk to the owner and the assistant before you 
     can do this.

Vase Piece no. 3
At:  Raine's Pub
How: Head up to the second floor. Squall generally have some 
     hallucination... Raine is there examining the cupboard. Actually, 
     this is the new tenant. Talk to her and the cat.. Pay attention to
     this phrase "Smell flower fragmance"
     Now head to the 1st floor, examine the flower [it was in a vase
     found at the lower screen]. Now Squall will again see Raine and 
     the cat will be there. Examine and you will find the 3rd Vase 
     Piece.

Vase Piece no. 4
At:  The Florist's Shop
How: As you walk down, you will noticed that the owner was always at the
     outside of the shop.. Now talk to her while at the shop. Now 
     examine the flower bed (inside the shop, lower right hand corner)
     and you will get the 4th Vase Piece.

Now head back to the mansion and he will give you the Holy Stone as 
your reward.

After finishing the Galbadia Continent (getting bored with the cards?),
it is time to navigate other parts of the world.. Located at the north
continent, Trabia, you will find a structure located at the Winter 
Island. Now enter the building.

Notice the townfolks are similar looking to NORG? This actually the 
hometown of the Shumis.. There is a draw point there.. which allows you
to get Ultima. Be sure your eyes are opened wide when you decided to 
draw magic from it as there is no refund!

Head for the elevator and you will ended up underground.. which is 
actually a beautifully generated town. Walk towards the left until you
found a pond. The building found at the northwest is your destination.
There Squall will be amazed by the statue. It was the statue of Laguna.
In other people's eyes, Laguna is a hero (well for Squall's case, he 
think Laguna is a funny joker..) Talk to the scuplutor and he will give 
you the following option:

OK. <--
We don't have time

Remember to draw Firaga from the draw point found at the back. Now head
back the Elder's House, located a screen right from here. You will find
the Moomba that is blocking the entrance is finally out of your way..
Now you can access to the draw point [Blizzaga]. Now enter the room.

were here. He was also told on where do Moomba's originated from. It 
was actually 17 years ago, Laguna has ended up here and teaches the
Moomba to talk... Next the Elder will tell Squall that they wished to
complete the statue and would like Squall to assist them in completing
the statue. Now head back to the room where you find the scupulator.
He will tell Squall that he needs to find ingredients to make the 
statue and you will be given the following prompt.

Alright <--

the Attendant refuse to work.. Now return back to Elder's House and you
will find out the reason. Next seek the Moomba outside for help. Next 
you will find Attendant's willing to work! Next talk to Attendant and 
he will say that it will be better if Artisan would help.. Now proceed
to Artisan's House and you will know the reason why he is so upset..

Now proceed to Elder's House. Next talk to him. A stubborn... Artisan.
Well, I was nearly stucked and found out the solution. Recall all the
Moomba occurences..

Moomba at D-District Prison - err.. can't enter it.
Moomba at FH - well, you can find one at Grease Monkey's House!
Moomba at Shumi - there are two.. One is at the entrance of Elder's 
                  House. The other one is actually a knob that triggers
                  the background music.

Martine. Now proceed to Grease Monkey's House.

Timber Obel Lake Mystery                                      ffviii_071
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Three Stars, 1x Luck-J Scroll
Magic:    n/a
Save Pts: n/a
Monsters: n/a [use Enc-None]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least, I have finally made this section possible. Thanks to a few
contributors for the answers for this mystery. First of all, you need
to locate the lake. It is at Galbadia where you will find shallow waters
[the colour seems a bit lighter.]. Now there is an arc of land that 
edges into the lake. Just press X and you will see the message below:

It's Obel Lake
 Throw a rock
 Try humming <-- (this does not work in Disc 1 and 2)

A black shadow rose to the surface
Throw a rock
Try humming again <--

Black Shadow: "...Hello, humans. What a lovely time."
              "There's something large there...."
Press X again
Black Shadow: "Hello!"
Black Shadow: "Can doe me a favour please?"
              (What is it?) <---
              (I don't want to hear it.)
Black Shadow: "It's my friend, Mr Monkey, can you find him for me?"
Black Shadow: "Mr Monkey should be in a forest somewhere. Keep walking
               around and I'm sure to find him."

Now you need to find Mr. Monkey... Next examine the lake and choose to
"throw a rock" and retreat after you have something like the following
message below..

The rock skipped 3 times

You need to get a phrase that says "The rock skipped many many times." 
You will know why later.. Now head to Dollet and you will find a train 
station near it right. On the extreme left, you will find a forest.
[Dollet- Hasberry Plains] and you will have the following message.

There is a monkey
   Throw a rock <---
   Sing (very funny.. hahahahaha!)

You will ALWAYS miss if you picked a stone that skip between 1 ~ 5 
times.. and you will always get this message..

"Ahh Darn it!" Y-You're just a big loser. I make to skip the rock as
many times as I want! So there! Ha-ha! Loser! Dork! Idiot! Your mom
wear combat boots"

If you use the rock "The rock skipped many many times."... you will 
definately see this message:

 "... OUCH!
   ... D-Darn it
    ... You're gonna to pay for that!"
The monkey will then threw a rock at you and upon inspecting the rock, 
you will find some carving on it. "URHAEO"

Now report back to Black Shadow.
You need to talk to the Shadow until he have you the corresponding 
phrases:

1st rock >>>
Balamb Area <Rinual Shores>
Phrase: "At the beach in Balamb something special washes a shore all 
        times"
Now head to Balamb Town [don't enter it]. Instead search the shore
way.. There is a special edge-out of sand when the tides are low. Just
check that area and you will find the second rock "STSLRM"

2nd rock >>>
That's the rock that you have obtained from Mr Monkey. Anyway, if you 
can't find him the Shadow will give the following hints:
"If he's not around, perhaps he took a train towards Dollet."
--> that's when you can't find Mr. Monkey...
"Mr. Monkey had a rock like this I think..."
that's the clue for that rock... "URHAEO"

3rd rock >>>
Galbadia Area <Timber- Mandy Beach>
"You'll find something on an island of east of Timber, too."
It's an elevated island where you need enter through Ragnarok. Enter
it through Balamb is possible. But will be very hard... Just search
along the land and you find the rock, "REAIDR"

4th rock >>>
Galbadia Area <Galbadia- Monterosa Plataeu>
"There's also something on top of a mountain with a lake and cavern."
Just followed the trails of the river and it will lead to a waterfall.
Now landed Ragnarok on top of the mountain and search the edge where
you will found the waterfall and you will have the following message:

A bird is warming an egg.
Check it up     <-- 
Leave it alone  

Check the egg out and you will have a fight against 2x Thrustaevis,
they are quite simple {Mug: 8x Shear Feathers, 6 AP} and you will found 
the 4th rock "EASNPD"

 Writings on the man-made rock:

  No.   Rock Location    : Carvings on the rock
  1.  Balamb rock        : S T S L R M
  2.  Mr. Monkey rock    : U R H A E O
  3.  Timber rock        : R E A I D R
  4.  Lake Cavern rock   : E A S N P D

Words Build taken from the 4 Rock: MORDRED PLAINS HAS TREASURE 
Hint: Read from right to left from top to bottom on the carvings.

Okay time to head for the Morded Plains. It is north from the Great 
Plains of Esthar, behind the mountains. You can find the entrance of 
Trabia Canyon [where Laguna's 4th Dream Sequence occured there...]
Next you need to search it thorougly and here is a small map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
tt  - Trabia- Vienne Mountains
XX  - Esthar- Morded Plains
*   - Treasure [Three Stars]
ee  - Esthar- Norties Mountains

Clear enough? Actually, the Morded Plains looks more like a hexagon
compared to a star to me. Just simply press X with XXX Area [they 
look a bit more brighter...] and you will have the following message:
[you can't view them on the world map, instead you will find message
boxes instead..]

"There are many multicolored rocks with faces all over the place.."
Press "X" again then a rock will spoke:    
The blue-faced rock whispers 
"People call us :The Liars Rocks!"  
"I don't know were the treasure is..."

It will also gives some hints..
"Some just talk nonsense." 
"Some just repeat the same thing."
"Some just say opposite of what we say."

Next press X and you have a couple of speeches from other rocks and
they are:

The black-faced rock tell you sternly: 
"The treasure is probably at the direction of the North Star"

The white-faced rock tells you coldly
"The treasure is located at the west." or 
"The treasure is located at the east." or
"The treasure is located at the north." or 
"The treasure is located at the south."

The red-faced rock tells you angrily
"The treasure is to the east." or
"The treasure is to the west." or
"The treasure is to the north." or
"The treasure is to the south." or
"The treasure is not here."

As you could figure out, that the black-faced rock is the one that keep
on telling you the same thing. However if you attempt to follow the 
white-faced rock to north and next it will say to the east, to all sort
of directions!. Therefore the mostly reliable source of information 
comes from the red-faced rock! Just watch for its speech and move a step
towards it's direction each. Ignore all other messages except for the 
red-faced rock. The treasure, which is a Three Star item is found in the
center of the star.. But you must have this message box: " The treasure
is not here.", press X again and you will get the treasure. It takes 
time and patient to solve this mystery. Avoid taking long distances, 
that's a tip that I could give.

There are still two more spots...

Hint #1
"Take sometime off at Eldbeak Peninsula. I bet its a wonderful place."

[that's located at Trabia, and you will see a small edge out facing 
Dollet if you view the World Map. It is between the vertical distance
between Shumi Village and Balamb Town.]

Eldbeak Peninsula : TRETIMEASUREATMINOFFDEISLE
Break the password up and it will give you the following:
If you take out the words TIME and OFF
TRE - TIME - ASUREATMIN - OFF - DEISLE
You get: TREASURE AT MINDE ISLE. The black-faced rock kept saying the 
treasure was at the north, but instead the blue rock has mentioned that
some of the rocks meant opposite of what they mean. At the lower-left 
area of Esthar, you will find: MINDE ISLAND! [Isle is a common short 
found used for "Island"]. Refer to Fig 10.1. Now head there (required the
Ragnarok] and search the area and you will find another item, Luck-J 
Scroll!

Hint #2:
This one I am still searching for it. "Take a break at the railway 
road." I think the treasure could be a draw point. I have just simply
follow the train track and search it on the oher side where I find a
draw point [Curaga] on West Coast of Esthar. You will also find a man 
in the Seaside Station. That person also uses Level 7 cards!

Thanks to a fellow contributor, he manages to find out the reason (which
is very convincing) but I did made some corrections to suit the
walkthrough.

From Jack Taylor:
" Firstly, I have found the answer to "take a break at the railroad 
bridge"; "I wonder what it means?" This is a little joke on behalf of 
Squaresoft. They mean you to take the words very literally, and sure 
enough, on the Galbadia continent, there is a bridge with both a 
railway and a road going across it (hence railroad). There is a 
little area of land to the right hand side of the bridge, between 
the cliff and the river that can only be accessed with the Ragnarok. 
Land the Ragnarok on this strip of land then walk to the corner 
nearest the bridge, press X button, and there is a draw point with.... 
you guessed it.... "break" spells in it (hence "take a break"). 
This is hardly very valuable, and as far as I know there is nothing 
else there, so it is just Squaresoft wasting our time." 

Hint #4:
Unexpectedly, there was indeed a fourth hint from Mr Shadow..

Well, I think that Jack Taylor really deserves a round of applause for
solving the remainder of secret, which turn out to be another joke...

Mr Shadow always says "take a break at the railroad bridge" and "take 
some time off at Eldbeak Peninsula" Thanks to Jack, he managed to cover
something else...

According to him:
Mr Shadow says "Back in the day, South of here, there used to be a 
small but beautiful village surrounded by deep forests. Everyone lived 
a happy life there". 

And here is his solution for the problem.

"This refers to a spot on the southernmost Centra continent. It is a 
more or less circular clearing surrounded by forest. When you walk up 
to it on the world map and press the X button and it says "nothing here 
but rubble" and if you press X again it says "absolutely nothing".

Finding The Rare Cards - through Quest
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some cards that are very hard to find... There are typically
4 quests for you to go through.. and the most confusing one is the 
Chicobo Card. Even Markweb has spoiled the word wrap, but he has done an
excellent job in explaining this section. I have made several 
corrections and expanding the Card Queen's Quest. Except for the Card
Queen's Quest and CC Group, the remainding two quests does not required
any card playing..

         1x Protect Stone, 3x Meteor Stone, 2x Ultima Stone, 1x Chicobo
         Card.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know that there are six Chocobo forests found at various regions
of the world map? The seventh one is being surrounded by Grandidi 
Forests and also known as the "Chocobo Holy Region". You could reach 
there by crossing the shallow waters from the Chocobo Forest found at 
Trabia's Bika Snowfields.

What is needed to done for this sub-quest?
You needed catch to a "Mother Chocobo" at each forest without needed 
any help from the "Chocoboy". Next you needed to find an item (Ultima 
Stone, Meteor Stone, etc.) These items shows that the Chocobo have some
affection to Squall it signifies that Squall was like 'one of them'. 

Here is the ChocoWhis Menu. You will given a tutorial for 1,000 gil 
from the Chocoboy. He will typically explains on what does the Sonar 
do..

ChocoWhis Menu (Press Square to bring up the menu)
To detect: [Choco Sonar]  --> explaination (1)
To catch: [Choco Ziner]   --> explaination (2)
Help Me --> explaination (3)
No way, I'm not doing this --> explaination (4)

(1) Choco Sonar
This part of whistle allows you to detect the traces of Chicobos. At
the lower right hand corner, you will find a red bar. That's the sonar.
It will reacts tremendously to strong signals and you can activate it.
Press X to select Chocobo Sonar and hold down the Triangle button and 
walk around the area... High signals area always produces a high pitch.

(2) Choco Ziner
This part of the whistle allows you to catch the Chicobo. Just after
finding the area with the strongest signal... Press Square to activate
the menu and press X to choose Choco Ziner. Press Triangle to whistle..
A Chicobo will come down. If failed, Squall's ChocoWhis will be stolen.
[you will find the Chicobo standing on Squall's head.) If it is stolen, 
talk to Chocoboy and pay 700 gil for the replacement.

(3) Help Me
This will cause Squall to ask the ChocoBoy to ask for help. You need to
pay 1200 gil and the Mother Chocobo will appear. However you can't have
that Mother Chocobo to dig for Stones.

(4) No way, I'm not doing this
Quit from the ChocoWhis Menu and do nothing.

Familiar with the Tutorial? Each Chocobo Forests have different 
requirements and your aim to capture all Chicobos so that the Mother
Chocobo will appear. For those whom have summon the Mother Chocobo for
the first time, you will be able to name your Chicobo for the Choco
World in Pocketstation. How to load data to your Pocketstation, refer to
your manual. During your detection process, you can talk to the Chocoboy
and he will give the following options:

A hint                    600 gil
Gyashl Greens 5x / 10x    3000 gil / 6000 gil
Question                  Free, nah 10 gil
Forget It.

Here the list of the Chocobo Forest and a Hint:

X- the spot where you can gather the stones.
C- denotes where you find the Chocoboy.

UFO Sighting Incident                                         ffviii_073
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   5x Elixirs, 1x Aegis Armlet, 1x PuPu's Card
Magic:   n/a
Save Pt: n/a
Occur:   World Map.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now time for some good looking quests, I would recommend you to do this
after getting Tonberry GF as it has ability that allows you to buy 
Elixir [but it will be expensive, so followed the cheat at the end of 
the section.] To make things work it easier, equip Enc-None [GF Diablos'
ability]. You will be able sight UFOs in battles.

UFO Sighting Spots [you don't have to do this sequence in this order]
1. Winhill Bluffs (east from Winhill) (Cow)
2. Mandy Beach [shores] (south-east from Timber). (head of a Statue)
3. Esthar-Kashkabald Desert (north-west from Cactuar Island) (Pyramid)
4. Health Island (east from Trabia Garden) *you needed the Ragnarok
   to accomplished this. (Artifact)
 
How pilot Ragnarok and head to the Great Grandidi Forests [errr.. there
is only one huge forest found in Esthar continent.] Just head towards
north from the Chocobo Holy Area which you done in Disc 2. And land
Ragnarok on the hilltop north from it. Wonder around and you will 
encounter the UFO!

UFO?  Stats
HP: 12,100 LV.100   AP: none    
Attack: none        Draw: Demi
Steal: none         Win: Aegis Amulet

It does not attack, just keep on attacking it. Well, the item dropped
seems to be a good one..

*Make sure you have the Item Command

After it fled away with a Big BANG, you can now head towards the area 
where Balamb Garden is formerly located and you will encounter the PuPu, 
(it's the pilot of the UFO and he was ejected before his ship explodes). 
You can choose kill it and receive Accelerator or help him recover by 
giving him (Accelerators are cheap stuff compared to the Hungry Cookpot)
, it keep on saying "Elixir Please" and "More Elixir please" gave it 5x 
Elixirs, which you have brought then you will receive PuPu card.
  
PuPu   Stats
HP: 810  LV. 100   AP: none 
Attack: none        Draw: Firaga, Blizzardga, Thundaga, Curaga
Steal:  none        Help: PuPu Card   Defeat: Accelerator 

Just help and get that PuPu's Card. In my opinion, 5x Elixirs for a 
Hungry Cookpot and a PuPu card into the collection, is definately
better than an Accelerator. [besides the ability learn is also much 
better]

Card Queen's Quest                                            ffviii_074
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 1x Kiros' Card, 1x Chubby Chocobo's Card, 1x Doomtrain's Card,
       1x Phoenix's Card, 1x Irvine's Card
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Card Queen, or in the game she is being addressed as "Queen". She is
actually the person whom monitors the card rules in the region where you
found her. You can actually add or remove a card rule by pay her 30,000
gil each time. But most of time, you won't get rules that you wished..
But I found her quite useful as you can remove a ton of rules after you
have returned from the space journey. You will find her at the train 
station of Balamb as you start the game.

The Card Queen will says that she will start to get bored after she 
have gotten a Rare Card or lost a Rare Card. But normally you need to
lose one rare card at the beginning ^_^; She is also quite formidible 
as she could be dramatic changes to the card trading rule.. Okay after
lost a card where she will go? Here are the locations:

Name of Town         Where is she?

Balamb               In front of Balamb Train station 
Dollet               2F of Pub where you find the Card Master.
Deling               Inside the Galbadia Hotel. (not in the room!)
FH                   At the screen left of the deserted train track.
Winhill              Found her at 1F of Flower Restaurant
Esthar               Found her inside the Presidential Palace. 
Lunar Site           Random spot [not avaliable after gotten Ragnarok)
Shumi Village        In the Inn of Shumi Village.

Okay.. typically it is a trading of cards. Now lost a rare card and make
sure that she head back to Dollet. Now proceed to the Pub and she will
say that she will tell you that if you lost a certain card, her father
will paint another card.. 

Card Lost      Card Gained      [Location]/Who?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
MiniMog        Kiros            [Deling] Collect it from the guy in 
                                black wandering at the shopping street.
Sacred         Irvine           [FH] Collect it from Mayor Dobe's wife, 
                                Flo
Chicobo        Chubby Chocobo   [Balamb Garden], collect it from the 
                                man sitting outside library
Alexander      Doomtrain        [Timber], collect it from Owner of the 
                                Timber Pub
Doomtrain      Phoenix          [Esthar] collect it from Odine's 
                                assistant, Aide found inside the 
                                Presidental Palace.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can never get the card without losing the card that the Card Queen
requested to do so. [how is her father going to paint it for you.] 
Remember that if you have defeat her to get a rare card or lost another 
rare card, she will moved to another region.. So it is best to obey 
instructions! For this quest, it is best to save your game frequently.
The Card Queen is also not a person whom you can messed with.

Hint: Remove the Random, by playing in Balamb Region, so that you could
      choose the card that you wish to lose.

CC Group Members                                              ffviii_075
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 1x MiniMog's Card, 1x Leviathan's Card, 1x Carbuncle's Card,
       1x Gilgamesh's Card
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will only start to gather cards once I have gotten sufficient cards.
You need to get aleast the Minotaur's, Sacred's, Ifit's and Diablos' 
cards. They are very important for the card quest as they are your 
ultimate cards for this quest. You can get more cards such as Odin [if
you decided to head for Centra Ruins first..]. It will be better if you
have completed the previous card pages before for this quest. The fifth
card is optional..

Ultimate Card Strategy!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 2 3    1) Place Sacred's card at spot 3
4 5 6    2) Place Minotaur's card at spot 9
7 8 9    3) Place Ifrit's card at spot 8
         4) Place Diablo's card at spot 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Card Strategy for Plus/Same.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It cannot be counted as a strategy but it works for me. Place your 
weakest card in the center. Upon the computer has finished for its turn,
look out for any applications of Plus/Same. Next, the computer will
normally try to counter with Plus and Same. Look out for it before 
placing down your card. Good strategy if you needed to protect your 
cards while trying to eliminate the Random rule by keep on playing at
Balamb Area.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After getting all the cards [for other pages, note that the Cards page
5 that there is blank as you can't get that card now.. it is a rare 
card...] Try to get as many as possible.. You should have no problem in
covering all cards execept for the characters, BOSS [page 6 & 7] and 
GFs. In Balamb, there are a lot of players. So try your luck. After you
have completed page 1 to 5 cards [get aleast 3x cards each...], It's 
time to seek a higher challenge.. the Card Group. Note: do all these 
stuff in Balamb Garden, you are not really to challenge the outside 
world.. If you have incurred the random rule from your previous card
games, continue to play at Balamb Garden and it will eventually switch 
to Balamb Garden's rules.

The Card Group is considered as the most strongest group of card players
in FF8. All except the Card Master can be found in Balamb Garden. Here 
is the sequence [remember that it is vital to save your game..]:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:  CC Group Jack
Area:  In front of the elevator. Usually walks from Library...
Description
He is a Garden Cadet. He will be the first one to introduce to you 
about the CC Group. He will be the first one to challenge you in a 
card game. Remember the guy that ask you whether you have challenged 
the Card Group?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Jack has been defeated (guess what? You have become one of the 
best card players!), other members will started to show up.. which also
marks the beginning of the 4-Suit Quest. Follow in order..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-Suit: CC Group Knight Club
Area: The area where you find the Dormitory, Parking Lot and Cafeteria
Description:
He is also a Garden cadet. He will says "Draw.." once you have 
approached him. Quite easy as he rarely uses Level 7 Cards. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Suit: CC Group Princess Diamond
Area: The Lobby, where you find the Directory. 
Description:
Two female Garden cadets. They are usually in pairs and chit-chat with
each other. Can only play with them, while they were chit-chating at 
the Directory. Normally, you will get a lot of Level 7 cards from them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-Suit: CC Group Prince Spade
Area: The 2F alley, the man near the elevator. 
Description:
He is the same guy, who have given the 7 cards in Disc 1 if you talk to 
him. (he normally say "so can you finished the game"). Not quite 
strong.. It is quite easy to defeat him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-Suit: CC Group Queen Heart 
Area: Area at the bridge 
Description:
She is actually Xu.. Defeat her in order to get the Carbuncle Card. She
is quite strong in her card tactics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Former Card King: Dr. Kadowaki
Area: Infirmary
Description:
You have seen her so many times in the game.. She is quite strong.. as
she will have at least one Level 7 card in the game. Even with the above
ultimate strategy, I also lost... I believe that you need to defeat her
in order to challenge the present cardmaster king
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CC Group Leader: Master King 
Area: At the Dormitory after you have defeat all suits and Dr Kadowaki.
      Head to Dormitory and choose to be alone and sleep.. "he" will
      challenge Squall at the middle of the night.
Description:
Believe it or not.. "he" is actually Quistis! She is really strong in
her card tactics. Defeat her in order to get the Gilgamesh Card. You
will be able to challenge her at the bridge after the night incident.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last CC Group Member: CC Group Magician Joker
Area: Training Center, where you find the wooden planks.
Description:
He is actually the "Man in Garden" whom sold items.. You will get a 
Battle Meter Upgrade if you defeat him. You can get the Levithan Card
from him. The upgrade is actually adding in the GF report...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can still challenge the CC Group in Disc 4..

Enter the door found nearest to Ultimecia's Castle.

Just simply walk through that thick forests and find a huge Chocobo
Forests. [you should know the shape by now..]. Just simply enter the 
forest and get a Chocobo from there. For my case, I have found six 
Chocobos already.

After gotten Chocobo, do not press X. Just go through the western side
of Esthar Continent. You will find those transparent barriers along 
your way. Remember that Chocobo can cross shallow waters as due to 
their quickness [I suppose that the Chocobos here are more powerful..]

Just simply wonder down the continent and you will find great 
Khashabald Desert.. Southeast of that great desert [from World Map 
point of view. The red dot that's not moving is actually the Ragnarok]
you will find a path lead into the desert and you will find the 
Ragnarok landed next the door. Now unboard from the Chocobo and enter 
Ragnarok and press the following:

Press Circle [this will lead to the cockpit] and hold Triangle.

You will reached the sequence, if you battle all the CC Group members
in the Balamb Garden. At the haul, you will meet Xu and she will talk
to Squall that CC Group has come to seek for revenge and decide to 
challenge him for cards once more. Here is list, where you will
encounter them:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Member                Location
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CC Group Heart        Haul of the Ragnarok
CC Group Spade        Hangar
CC Group Diamonds:    Main Hall
CC Group Jack:        Hallway that's located on right side of the Haul
CC Group Club:        2F- Stairway
CC Group Joker:       You will find this guy near the elevator [where
                      you need to board to head for Ragnarok.]
CC Group King:        Just get Quistis in your party and head for the
                      cockpit and challenge her for the card game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

My experience in this quest:

Virtually, the CC Group Members have hold all the cards that you have 
not collect since the beginning of the game. [except for the Cards that
you have used Card-Mod which you will find status screen saying "Used
Up"]. Now this is really an headache. First of all, they will start to
add rules each time you battle them. Like in this order:

Balamb - Dollet - Galbadia - Trabia - FH - Centra - Esthar - Lunar Base

Worst still, the cards does not appear all the time.. You may depend a 
lot on luck. Remember that you must getting the card according to the
card order in the card page. That means if you haven't gotten the 
Phoenix's and Doomtrain's Card, you must gotten the Phoenix's Card 
before you could challenge them for the last cards. Some of the cards 
that is originally found with CC Group Members such Leviathan being 
found from the CC Group Magician Joker, will only be won from the 
original owner only. The more rules you add [by challenging them, they
will add rules], the more chances you will get the rare cards in the
game. BTW, the above cards that you found here can be obtained from the
Card Queen's Quest which is described in detail in Part I.

There are two rare cards for Gilgamesh. First of all, you must get the
Gilgamesh from the CC Group King. There you must modified it using
Card-Mod and get 10x Holy Wars. Now head for the haul and challenge
Xu for a card game and you will see another Gilgamesh card! Currently,
I am still trying out for other cards. 

How to win card battles? Here is what I normally do [even my own 
record does seems that great, I have only ~40% winning percentage 
compared to my brother's ~50% winning percentage. But I have played 
over a thousand card games, whereas my brother has only play 20 card
games (but he has played the tougher ones more often).]... Once you 
reached the Ragnarok, head to the Ragnarok to save your game. Next 
challenge for cards, [most of the rare cards are obtained Diamonds], 
and get the rare card. If you lost a rare card, reset and replay again. 
Once you have gotten a rare card, save your game and then resume. Make 
sure you don't lose any rare cards, or it will be much harder.. Here
is a brief summary on how I play card games with the following rules:
[I only include the tough ones]

Random: don't bother whether it is lousy cards or rare cards. Just 
shoot. In my opinion, some of Level 4~5 cards are great for Plus and
Same Rule. They could kill my opponent through Card Combo and Plus.

Same/Plus: Just required some more mental calculations. If you are not
quite good in mathematics, just use a calculator. Plus rule is more
useful compared to the Same Rule in my opinion. You can even make use of
this to turn over the tables at your opponent. Imagine that I have only
1 card left on the board and the last slot, I put. I got a straight 
combo with Pluses and Same. As the result, I won. [That's all I got 
Edea's card.]

Sudden Death: Never ever place your most powerful cards on the board
under this rule. Remember that you need to protect them. As if it ended
up with a draw, you will continue with the cards that you have earlier
got under your control. This is most dangerous rule in my opinion.

The rest are not that importance, but do not ignore them as they are
quite helpful. If you have forgetten the rule, just press Circle while
having the game and a glimpse of the summary. One last tip: no matter
how strong your opponent are, there is always a glimpse of hope in
defeating them. Never give up!

After done with this, you can pay a visit to the Card Queen at the 
Abadan Plains where you first met Piet at Crashed Lunar Base.

2 rare cards? It has been confirmed for the Gilgamesh. But I myself
will assume that there are 2 rare cards. One is from the present and
the other one is from the future. Ugh! The Time Compression is giving
me headaches! Except for PuPu's card, I guess there are actually 2
rare cards... Still testing.

Zell's Love Quest                                             ffviii_076
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before heading to the above areas, I recommend you to return back to 
Balamb Garden. Make sure that Zell is in your party so that you can do
this.. Head inside the Library. BTW, I have to repeat some of 
paragraphs, just to remind you as it last until Disc 3... One of the
contributors has even given me a detailed sequence about the game and
also the girl's name. [Shizuka is the name of the ponytail girl's 
friend]

Before going to the Fire Cavern. The girl with pigtail will mention 
something about Library regulations for kids then talks about someone 
she likes.

Before going to Timber, with Zell in party, talk to the girl and Zell 
will talk about his long wait for the book "Goodbye Pupurun". (That 
book is borrowed forever by Raijin! Check out the Study Panel)

Zell will meet up with the girl with pigtail and was asking whether his
book "Good Bye- Pupurun" is ready or not. (Well, he has already been 
waiting for several months already.. in fact, it has been borrowed by 
Raijin forever) Now exit and continue with the other quests first [one 
will do..] I am not sure whether this needed to be done before Balamb 
Garden has turned into a mobile ship or not.. I have did this after I 
have defeat NORG. (which means Zell is in the Alpha Team..)

Now head back and you wil find a conceited SeeD passing by the counter
asking whether the girl with pigtail is around. She will told him that
the girl is on leave. [complete all quests before your jounery to 
Balamb Town]

Once you have free Balamb Town from Galbadia, remember to head to the
train station where you will find a girl [dressed in school uniform..
talk to her.] 

Before heading for Trabia, for Library once again and you will meet the
friends of girl with pigtail and asking Zell a questionaire...

What's Zell's favourite colour?
Red on my jacket
Blue on my pants
I'm embaressed but pink

What's Zell's favourite food?
Beef
Fish
Hot Dogs..

Then you will be asked to leave the area. Before meeting up with 
Galbadia Garden (after Trabia incident) and head back to Balamb Garden.
Head for the area in the Library where you find the Esuna draw point. 
Next you will have a sequence.. Guess what is it? 

At Disc 3, after Squall is being asked to head for Edea's House.. head
back to the Library and girl at the counter will tell Zell that the girl
with pigtail is looking for you. Now head back to Balamb Town and you 
will find the girl that you have meet in train station. Talk to her and
she will tell Zell that she has been here.. Now head to Zell's House
and you will find Zell's mom telling him that the girl with pigtail was
here already on... Now head for the hotel, and pay 100 gil. The next
morning, your party will find Zell missing.. Head downstairs and you 
will find Zell and girl with pigtail. She will hand in the Combat King 
003 to Zell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bone Quest.
Well, Dollet is really an area of mystery.. During the trip to Galbadia
Garden, you can head there and do this side quest. But you can have this
quest done on Disc 2 onwards. Just simply enter the city, through the 
back path. Next you will reached the Rent-A-Car Shop.. Walk south and 
you will find a restaurant and harbour. Head west and you will be back
at the place where you first battle the Galbadians [with Seifer in your
party]. The city has been revamped... Next walk up and you will find the
dog! Talk it and a cat with the bell will fall onto the ground. Enter
the house on the left. You will find a man whom is upset over the boy 
for messing up his painting by drawing bones. [you can play cards with
the boy..] Talk to the boy. Next you will find a painting [observe.. 
it's a painting of Dollet!] Now let's begin the quest.

Painting No.1: Painting of the Fountain in front of Dollet Hotel
Head there and examine the dog and choose 1st option ["Look"] and you
will get a Potion!

Painting No.2: Painting of the Dollet's Pub and the overhead bridge.
Head there and examine the dog [which is under the bridge.] Pick the
first option "Look" and you will get 1x Phoenix Down!

Painting No.3: Painting of the alleyway outside the house.
Just exit and examine the dog [which is on left], pick the first 
option and you will get 1x Soft!

This time, you will have a quarrel.. do it yourself! Actually the
man is also known as the Card Artist. The boy is actually the son of
the Card Queen!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the subquest, it is time to navigate around the town.. Now head 
for Pub. Head up to the second floor and you can get another copy of the
Timber Maniacs.. Now talk to the man [dressed like a rich fellow..] and
he will give the following options. Pick the 2nd option each time and 
you will be able to challenge him. Note that he is tough. After defeat
him in the first time, he will brought to you to his fighting arena..
He is the Card Master! Now examine the layer of documents/magazines 
lying on the ground. You will get a lot of items from there and here is
the list: 2x Potion, 1x Phoenix Down, 1x Antidote and 1x Occult Fan II!
Talk to the Card Master and he will reward you with the following:

5x Geezard's Card
4x Red Bat's Card
3x Buel's Card
2x Anacondaur's Card
1x Cactaur's Card

Challenge him in the card game and get the Siren's Card! [if I am not
wrong, the area will add "Same" rule to your card game. Same and Plus
may seems difficult in the beginning but I can tell you that these rules
are going to be your most decision wining elements, refer to the section
above for more information.]

Head for the Hotel and pay 100 gil. You will be able to find a copy of 
Timber Maniacs at the desk found inside the room. You can get pass the
Dollet guard stationed along the path towards the Dollet Communications
Tower. Just talk with the guard twice and he will have..... and charge!
You will encounter Galbadian Soldiers there.

Infinite Money Trick                                          ffviii_078
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get infinite gil at any time later in the game (well, it applies 
any time after you get Tonberry to be exact).  Have Tonberry learn all 
menu abilities. Call an Item shop.  Buy as many Tents as possible. Even
without doing any SeeD Tests, I managed to accumulated sufficient cash.
You needed at most 100,000 gil (75,000 gil if you have Discount) to have 
100x Tents.

Now convert them into Mega Potions with Leviathan's Recov Med-RF 
ability. The exchange rate is 4 Tents = 1 Mega Potion. You will get 25x 
Mega Potions. Now sell them and you can get 187,500 gil in return! 
That's a quick gil.. Unlike you have to wonder and wait for a salary
payment from SeeD. If you don't like the idea of sacrificing a Tent, you
can also go nuts with Mesmerize Blade, which can be won from Mesmerize!
That's a short cut to get quick money.

GF Enhancement Setup                                          ffviii_079
========================================================================
GFs are extremely good for not only combat as also it could customize
your characters to great superb characters, but allowing Magic to be 
junctioned through the Junction System and boost up their stats. Unlike
in previous FF Series, Character's strength will be in greatly by 
getting their new weapons. In FF8, Weapon remodel only increases the 
strength by only a maximum of 20+ and the is Squall's Lion Heart.

GFs' Abilities are not quite evenly spread out. Therefore we could make 
use of Amnesia Greens to customize the characters into the stronger 
ones. In order to get the GF Items, refer to Item List for more 
information.

This section is fully contributed by Markweb Jimenez.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Characters Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Character:   Squall Leonhart
Recommend to Boost:  Str-J [255], Spd-J [80+]
Reason:
Squall's Lion Heart is extremely dangerous when Squall has accquired
255 Str stats and there will generally be more slashes if his speed is
higher. Squall's Lion Heart can ONLY does 9999 HP damage when his
strength is 255. But it is possible without Str 255, if you have cast
Meltdown on the enemy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Character:   Rinoa Heartilly
Recommend to Boost:  Str-J [200+], Mag-J [200+], Spd-J [70+]
Rinoa needed Str-J to increase damage of her Angelo Strike/ Cannon. 
Strength and Speed increases the number of hits and damage of 
Wishing Star. Magic Junction increases the effectiveness of Invinsible
Moon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Character:   Quistis Trepe
Recommend to Boost:  Str-J [200+], Mag-J [200+]
The higher her Strength, the more damage her ultimate Limit Break,
Shockwave Pulsar does. Magic is pretty important as it increases the
effectiveness of her magic-based Limit Breaks, such as the Mighty Guard
for example.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Character:   Selphie Tilmitt
Recommend to Boost:  Mag-J [255], Luck-J [20+]
Magic helps to increase the number of spells and damage of her Limit 
Breaks. Her Limit Breaks are typically based on magic. Luck helps to 
increase probability of using powerful spells in her Limit Breaks

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Character:   Zell Dincht and Irvine Kinneas
Recommend to Boost:  Str-J [255], Spd-J [120+]
Speed is almost everything for these two great offensive characters.
With a strength stats of 255, Zell's Punch Rush can does an outstanding
damage of 3000+ [more if Meltdown is being cast]. Speed helps to 
increase the amount of time for his Limit Breaks.

As for Irvine, both Strength and Speed are equally important [but you
would not get that much trouble if Irvine is being levelling up with
HP Bonus, Strength Bonus, Vitality Bonus and Magic Bonus. Speed helps
to slower the Timer and increases the recovery time for each ammo. With
a strength of 255, Irvine can does 9999 HP damage with his AP Ammo [
which is much easier to get and faster recovery time compared to Pulse
Ammo.]
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for their defense, Vit-J must get at least for 200+ for the members,
that are battling against the Weapons and Spr-J have to get at least 
100+ for defense against BOSSES such as Ultimecia, Sorceress etc.

Now here is an important note:
Don't remove a GF ability if you don't have the ability to replace to 
it. Remove GF abilities only if your character don't needed than 
ability or its replaceable.

Here will be Markweb's Setup for his customized GFs.

Defeating Malboros
by Qiao2324 
   Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Malboros can be defeated! Just meet the following requirements 
  - Berserk, Confuse, Sleep and Death (Pain will be quite good...)
  - 3x Initiative (c) [Pandemona, Tonberry, Cactaur]
  - Spd +40% [Pandemona, Cerberus]
  - Spd J [Cerberus, Pandemona] 
  - Auto Haste [Cerberus]
  - Aura [gotten from the Draw Points at the borders of Island closest
    to Hell/Heaven or the shoreline at the tip of Long Horn Island.]
  - Squall's Lionheart or Quistis' Degenarator]
  - Meltdown [needed if using Lionheart, draw from Gayla]
  - Treatment or Esuna [drawn from Mesmerize]
  - Str-J [if have Lionheart, junction to Squall's Str until 255]
  <> With Lion Heart
     Have all status ailment magic junctioned to ST-Def-J to that 
     character and give that character the Treatment command. First of 
     all, have the first character to cast Meltdown to weaken the 
     Malboro. Next after the Malboro have used the Bad Breath, have 
     that character use the Treatment to cure others and have the 
     members casting Aura on Squall. There will be a high probability 
     that Squall will use Lion Heart on the Malboro.... 
     Note: Malboro will not use Bad Breath if a character is still 
           under the status ailments.
  <> With Degenarator
     As you go into the battle, cast Aura on Quistis and have she
     cast Degenarator [first item on the 2nd Specials page.] This
     strategy works well against tough cookies such as the Ruby 
     Dragon.
  <> As a Party (NEW!, added by Scott Ong)
     Pretty amazed by this strategy.. You can get 2x Elem-Def-J x4
     One from Alexander and the other one from Doomtrain. Just 
     junction 100x Sleep, Confuse, Pain, Berserk to the character and
     give the character the Treatment command. Once the Malboro has
     used its Bad Breath, have that character cast Treatment on the
     remainding characters. Draw Demi from the Malboro and use on it.
     It will does 9999 HP damage each time.. Attack!

Status Elemental Strategy 
by Markweb Jimenez (markweb_3t@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Junctioned 100x Zombie to the 1st character's ST-Atk-J.
  - Junctioned 100x Pain to the 2nd character's ST-Atk-J
  - Junctioned 100x Death to the 3rd character's ST-Atk-J

  Commands ASCII Diagram
    __________          __________          __________
   |Commands  |        |Commands  |        |Commands  |
   |Attack    |  1st   |Attack    |  2nd   |Attack    |  3rd

   |__________|        |__________|        |__________|

   Start off with the 1st character attacking the monster [make sure 
   that it is not undead]. Have the second character used a Phoenix 
   Down, if it misses have the third character used the Revive Command.
   And the monster will be instantly killed! (if you do not have 
   Revive, just used Life Magic) If the monster is instantly undead, 
   used a Phoenix Down for an easy kill. Death works well against most
   monsters such as Behemoths.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fighting against Undead 
by Markweb Jimenez (markweb_3t@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't bother to attack, just use a Phoenix Down or cast Life on the 
monster. [Life can be drawn from Mesmerize] Note that you can make 
undead with Zombie, refer to the strategy above for more details. 
Zombie does not work on plants-type monsters such as Ochu and of course 
the undead.

Fighting against the monsters found at the Island closest to Hell
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In summary, here is a brief list and their toughest rating. Please read
as it is kinda important for survival. Currently, I am still figuring
out a better objective in defeating the Ruby Dragon. So watch for the
next update. [well, it can't be possible using Degenerator everytime..
unless you are willing to keep Quistis at low HP..]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name          Difficulty Rating
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Dragon   *****
Malboro       ****1/2
Grendel       ***
Hexdragon     ***
T-Rexaur      ***
Blue Dragon   ***
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy:
Ruby Dragon - I think it is the most dangerous monster in FF8. It's 
              Breath [when it is at Level 100] does 9999 HP to any 
              character who has less than 100 Vit Stats. Currently, I
              am still thinking a way to prevent that. I guess the best
              way is to use Degenerator and summon GF Doomtrain.
Malboro - refer to the strategy above.
Grendel - Junction Death/Sleep/Blind to your characters' ST-Atk-J along
          with Elem-Atk-J [Quake, Aero* or Blizzard*]. Well, just 
          attack. Blind junctioned ST-Atk-J is very important.
Hexdragon - Make sure you have high attacking power. Junction Firaga to
            your character's Elem-Def-J to nullify its Breath Attack.
T-Rexaur - Make sure that you have accquired Blizzaga junctioned to 
           Elem-Atk-J. Blind junctioned to the ST-Atk-J is vital or you
           will be its prey.
Blue Dragon - quite weak against status such as Blind, Death or Sleep.
              Quite an easy foe, so no fear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defeating the T-Rexaur
by Rob Strokes (r_stokes@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The T-Rexaur is weak against Ice. Junction 100x Blizzaga to your 
character's Elem-Atk-J and he/she can does as much as 4000 even with 
the Str stats of 100+. This is due to the weak defense of the T-Rexaur. 
Also junction 100x Blind to your character's ST-Atk-J so it is 
defenceless or use Doom to have the monster met his "doom".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleep ST-Atk-J Strategy
by Markweb Jimenez (markweb_3t@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all you must gotten spells such as Sleep, Haste, Slow
<> Sleep:   Funguar 
<> Slow:    LV 20+ Caterchipillar
<> Haste:   Iron Giant, Cactaur
Junction 100x Sleep to Squall's ST-Atk-J and make sure that he has high 
Speed stats. Give him also Auto-Haste. Junction 100x Slow to another 
character's ST-Atk-J. As for the last character, junction 100x Pain for 
his/her ST-Atk-J. Give that character with Slow, the Initiative ability 
first. Just keep on attacking with the third character summoning a GF 
and have the character with Slow, does the attacking first and followed 
Squall doing his job. In this way, you can conserve most of the HP of 
your GFs for BOSS fights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy defeat Iron Giant
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very bothering with the Iron Giant attacking your characters with the
Grand Sword which can inflict a minimum damage of 1000+ to all 
characters? Here is a method:
-> Junction 100x Sleep to every characters' ST-Atk-J!
-> Junction 100x Thundaga to every characters' Elem-Atk-J.
-> Equip GFs Diablos, Quezacotl, Lv100 Cactaur
Now as soon as your characters reaches his/her turn, attack the Iron 
Giant and it will be instantly under the Sleep status. Once under the 
Sleep status, summon Diablos and Quezacotl which should last about 2 
summons for each GF (unless superb compatibility). Have one character 
do stocking of Haste, if you don't have or have that character wait 
until the Sleep status wear off. And start to attack again. In this way, 
there is no chance for the Iron Giant to does damage on your characters. 
It also works on monsters such as Behemoth. Blind also workes well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy gaining EXP and AP through escaping
by Prasetia Gunawan
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have gotten Ragnarok and have GF Odin. Head for the Island
closest to Hell. The monsters give a handsome sum of EXP. Just simply
junction 1x Initiative for each character and run once you begin a
battle [press L2 and R2 to escape] If you are lucky, you will experience 
Odin entering the battle. It is Zantesuken doing the job.. works quite
well for repeated battles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Demi HP-Calculator 
by Markweb Jimenez (markweb_3t@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may know the monster's current HP by looking at the damage done by 
Demi spell. Example if the damage inflict is 3,600 and you know that 
Demi does 1/4 of damage. Multiply by 3 and you will get 10,800 HP and 
you don't have to trouble yourself in using the Scan spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meteor Destruction 
by Sung Kato (ssj3kato@hotmail.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An old strategy which I have forgotten to mention. Firstly you must have 
acquired GF Eden and have Expendx3-1 [or use the Three Stars which can 
be stolen from the Ultima Weapon, or the Card Refinement of Squall's
Card]. Stock Meteor from your fight against Ruby Dragon. Do here is the 
fun. Junction 100x Sleep to every character's ST-Atk-J and cause them in
Sleep status and summon GF Cerberus. Once the Triple Status is on, cast 
Meteor and you will be able to summon it thrice for the price of one 
without the monster attacking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The deadly of Doomtrain! 
by r_rjonah
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have Squall being equipped the Initiative command from Pandemona to get 
the first turn in battle right. Make sure that Squall was junctioned the 
GF Doomtrain. Make sure that Squall has a high compatibility with 
Doomtrain is about 1000! Once the battle began, summon the Doomtrain! 
BOOM!! almost all of the monsters have the SLOW, PETRIFY, SLEEP, 
DARKNESS, DEATH, BERSERK, POISON, VIT 0 all in one turn!!! Once it has 
happen just kill the monster IN ANY MANNER YOU WANT!!! But some 
monster are immune to the above effects (one good example is the 
Malboro) but many strong monsters are affected like the RUBY DRAGON, 
IRON GIANT ,BEHEMOTH and almost any other monsters will be affected!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Murderer.. 
by r_rjonah
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, have the following magic being junctioned to the
character's ST-Atk.
Squall --> 100x Death spells, will arise 100% for Sudden Death!
Zell   --> 100x Zombie spells, will arise 100% for Zombie!
Irvine --> 100x Break spells, will arise 100% for Petrify!
Make sure that Squall is protect from Confuse (otherwise, you will be
dead meat in no time if the other characters does not have 100% 
protection against Sudden Death. If the opponent is under Zombie 
status, use Recover for a quick kill. Revive will be much better.

The Stealer of HP
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty amazed when I first time discovered this. You can get HP too, by
using this superb combo. 100x Drain junctioned to ST-Atk-J. But it is
pretty weak and sometimes causes a huge damage.. Here is a brief 
summary. Typically it seldom works on BOSSES, that's I did not 
mentioned in the walkthrough!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Any element will support the case, unless the monster can absorbs the 
  element damage. Example:
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Snow Lion             Absorption Success Elements
  Weak against Fire     Elem-Atk-J: Fire/Wind/Earth/Thunder/Holy/Poison
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notice that I did not include Ice element? Because the Snow Lion 
  nullifies Blizzard*. If you don't have any magic junctioned to 
  Elem-Atk-J, it will be still a success. Happy stealing..

Ruby Dragons? No Fear!
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Dragons are extremely tough at high level as they could does an
astonishing 9999 HP damage to any characters with a Vitality less than 
100. The Breath carries no element unlike the Japanese version. Just to
reduce the damage, you must get a couple of important magic. Protect is
generally a must as it reduces physical/non-elemental damage by half. 
You must also get GF Cerberus or you need to have a lot of Triple. Make
use of Expendx3-1 as it saves Magic. You need magic such as Regen, 
Firaga [junctioned to Elem-Def-J], Blizzarga or Holy to Elem-Atk-J, 
Aura and GF Doomtrain [if you don't have 100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J and 
100x Meltdown.] Ruby Dragons are strong against Darkness, Poison, 
Petrify, Stop, Silence except for Slow, Vit 0 and Sleep. [if you have
100 quantity of that magic.] Drain to ST-Atk-J works well, but it is
not quite advisble. Instead prefer to use ST-Atk-J with Sleep 
junctioned. Just cast Protect on all characters, after casting Triple
(summon GF Cerberus.). Attack the Ruby Dragon with the characters that
has Sleep to ST-Atk-J only and followed by summoning Doomtrain [or 
Meltdown]. The Ruby Dragons will be greatly weaken and you can easily 
killed it off by summoning GFs such as Bahamut and Eden. You can also
choose to eliminate the Ruby Dragon with Limit Breaks.

Usefulness of Darkside
by Psyco Schizophrenic <psyco_2@usa.net>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one useful tip. Typically it only works on basic monsters such
as Ruby Dragons except for BOSS (exceptions: Fujin and Raijin). Just
simply has 100x Drain junctioned to ST-Atk-J. Equip Darkside command.
Now just use Darkside [which allows you to attack thrice as much and
also suffer a deflict of 1/10 of the current HP), you will be able to
drain the HP back while inflict as much as 3 times!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reduce EXP gain
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A helpful strategy for those whom want to train your characters. I 
myself typically started training when he has accquired LV 20. [for him,
his Strength stats is really good. LV 100, he can already gotten 175+
and that's without any bonus!]
Just give him Str Bonus while he have accquired Str Bonus. There is 
generally three methods to reduce EXP.. and gain a lot of AP:

1. Run! - don't quite like this method as your hands will generally got
   sore if you do that every moment. You will still get a portion of 
   EXP if you have attack the opponent.
2. Fight Cactuars - yep.. They give low EXP and at the same high AP. 
   Seize the opportunity to master Str Bonus for Ifrit, Mag Bonus for
   Siren, HP bonus for Brothers, Vitality Bonus for Carbuncle and Spirit 
   for Leviathan.
3. Use LV Down or LV Up. LV Down will reduce greatly the EXP gain. As 
   the lower levels, the more easier is the fight. The higher EXP, the
   faster the character will level up.

The Well of Souls

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase:                After Departing Timber/Before Laguna's 
                      Dream Sequence #2
Location:             Due West of Timber in brown area bordering
                      mountains, between ocean and train bridge
Monster:              Vysage, Lefty, Righty
Requirements:         Squall at Limit Break
                      All characters stocked with Silence and
                      Blind magic
Preferred Abilities:  All characters with ST-ATK-J
                      Squall with Silence
                      2nd Character with Silence
                      3rd Character with Blind
Order of Attack:      Squall, #2, #3
Target Priorities:    Silence Vysage
                      Silence Lefty
                      Blind Righty
                      Blind Vysage
                      Blind Lefty
Strategy:
  First Round
    Squall casts/attacks Vysage with Silence
    #2 casts/attacks Lefty with Silence
    #3 casts/attacks Righty with Blind
  2nd Round (assuming all 1st round attacks succeeded)
    Squall casts/attacks Vysage with Blind
    #2 casts/attacks Lefty with Blind
    #3 waits for 3rd round OR 
  Subsequent Rounds
    Draw and stock magic
  When the Head begins to use Curse (usually at higher
    levels and long after you have stocked all available
    magic) use Squall's Limit Break in the first round
    to KO the Head or Righty. The Curse cannot be
    summoned unless all three are parts of the Vysage
    are there. Silencing or blinding the Head does not
    stop the Vysage from casting Curse.
    
Each successful battle yields 12 AP and special items.
The most prized of the special items are Life Rings
and Regen Rings. You can also get Lightweights.

Using Siren's L MAG-RF, you can convert the Life
Ring into Life magic and the Regen Ring into Full-Life
magic at this early stage of the game. Otherwise, you
have to wait until the Esthar phase to grab/win these
items or after the Lunar adventure to fly to the
Island Closest to Heaven/Island Closest to Hell to
get this magic from the hidden Draw Points.

100x Lightweights can be converted to 1x Accelerator
after gaining Eden's GFAbl Med-RF in order to have a
GF learn Auto-Haste.

This is also an excellent opportunity to level-up your
characters, level-up your GFs, and add GF abilities.
Coming back at intervals before Esthar will help you
get those costly GF abilities in a short amount of time.

Depending upon your character's levels, you can draw
magic now from the Head (Esuna, Haste, Bio), Lefty
(Bio, Demi, Quake, Regen, Blind, Drain, Slow), and Righty
(Shell, Protect) instead of having to bog down through
later sections drawing from other monsters.

Well of Dark Matter
by borayar@home.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase:        Deep Sea Deposit, Battle Area #1
Location:     Battle Area #1
Monster:      Tri-Face (occurs at three locations all the time)
              Behind column before reaching Save Point
              Top of 2nd small stairs
              Top of stairs to next screen
   Note:      All monster locations can be reset by doing one of
              the following:
              Going to next screen and returning.
              Going back to Save Point and switching party
              members. Switching junctions is not required.
              Remember to keep Quistis in the middle position.

Requirements:
  . Quistis at Limit Break (Blue Magic - Degerator)
  . Siren at Level 100 with Tool-RF Ability
  . Move-Find Ability

Preferred Abilities:
   All characters with ST-ATK-J and Blind magic junctioned
   All characters with Initiative, Auto-Haste, and/or High
     Speed Junction             

Order of Attack:  #1, Quistis, #3

Strategy:
    #1 attacks Tri-Face with Blind
    If Quistis's Limit Break activates, Quistis casts Blue
      Magic - Degerator [auto-victory]
    If Quistis's Limit Break does not activate, press "O" to
      go to #3.
    #3 attacks Tri-Face with Blind
    Continue to press "O" until Quistis's Limit Break
      activates, then cast Blue Magic - Degerator [auto-
      victory]
    
Each successful battle yields 8 AP and special items (8x
Poison Powders, 8x Curse Spikes, or 3x Star Fragments).
The occurrence of Poison Powders/Curse Spikes is about 50/50,
with the Star Fragments being infrequent. Another Rare Item
is Tri-Face's Card.

Using Siren's TOOL-RF, you can convert 100x Curse Spikes
into 1x Dark Matter. The Dark Matter can be used to:
. Have Quistis learn Shockwave Pulsar
. Refine 100x Ultima Magic (Bahamut's Forbid Mag-RF)
. Refine 1x Luck-J Scroll (Eden's GFAbl Med-RF)
. Refine 1x Shaman Stone (Eden's Forbid Med-RF)
. Refine 1x SHaman Stone into
   . 1x Rosetta Stone (Eden's Forbid Med-RF)
   . 1x LuvLuv G (Siren's Tool-RF)

Using Siren's ST Med-RF, you can convert 1x Poison
Powder into 3x Antidotes. Using Call Shop, you can sell the
Antidotes for cash.

In fact, this is an another, excellent location to level-up characters, 
GFs, and GF abilities. You simply run up and down and use the local 
Save Point to assist in resetting the monster locations and switching 
out characters that achieve level 100 with others that haven't.

Remember to equip any Bonus Abilities (HP, Mag, Hit) to specific 
characters in order to get those additional levels in addition to 
experience levels.

I was able to accumulate 7x Dark Matters before all my characters 
achieved Experience Level 100. That provides enough Rosetta Stones to 
have every character have Ability x4 after modification and distribution 
of GFs.

Power-Up with Bonuses
by SnowBall87@aol.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What you need to do is get through the game on the smallest level 
possible, what I recommend is getting everyone to level 30 and stopping
there. You'll have to use enc-none or run to avoid getting exp. Then 
once you get the 4 bonuses from jumbo cactuar give them all to one 
character, kill the other members of your party and level him up till 
level 100. Then revive another character and give the bonuses to 
him/her and do that until everyone has gotten the bonuses and are at 
level 100. This will add 70 to you base stats. Don't put on the hp 
bonus though. I've played around with the different spells and I think 
I've got a pretty good junction now. Junction the spells like this:

HP- Ultima 
Str- Meteor 
Vit- Meltdown 
Mag- Flare(mag isn't that important), 
Spr- Reflect 
Spd- Triple 
Eva- Tornado 
Hit- Double 
Luck- Aura.
Elem-Atk- None 
Elem-Def- Shell, Life, Full-Life
ST-Atk- Pain, 
ST-Def- Death, Holy, Esuna, Reflect (But if you're fighting Malboro 
        make it Confuse, Sleep, Beserk, and Silence)

Now that you have all magic junctioned up set your abilties. The two 
must have abilties are Vit+%60 and Spr+%60. If you have those the 
ruby dragons breath attack only does 400 damage(pretty good huh?) and 
the last boss becomes a joke because the most damge she ever does 
aside from Gravija is 300 or so. Str+60% is also important on two of 
the characters but the other one should be a healer. What I have on my 
characters is Squall: Vit+60, Spr+60, Str+60, Spd+40 Zell: Vit+60, 
Spr+60, Str+60, Spd+40 Rinoa: Vit+60, Spr+60, Expend3x-1, Spd+40

If you followed my advice you'll have the most powerful characters 
around. Enjoy never fearing any opponent(except the weapons which can 
still kill you with ease)

Fast Levelling Up with Death Combo!
by MuxerMan@aol.com 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a strategy for beating practically ANY enemy (the only ones 
i've yet to see it work on are Malboros, Hexadragons, and Ruby Dragons,
and bosses of course.)!  Simply junction 100x death to all of your 
characters' attack. Watch the enemies drop!! It kills them in one hit, 
although sometimes it won't work until 2nd or 3rd hit. It will inflict 
no damage and the monster just fades away in a red transparency (kind 
of like how bosses died in FF3.) GREAT for leveling up, I gained 40 
levels in one day with it!! I'm not exactly sure but I think my rare 
item chance has gone up significantly when using this strategy..

The Perpetual Squall's Limit Break.
by Fong Liu <fongliu@ugcs.caltech.edu>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do this all you need is:
Aura OR Really low HP for Squall + Hero/Invincible Moon

The method is based on one simple realization: there is a chance for a
limit break whenever you press Circle [that's to change turns for your
characters] while in combat. Every time, you select Squall by pressing 
the Circle button, you give him a chance to use his Limit Breaks.

So here is one possible way to utilize Squall's Perpetual limit break:
(Pre-combat) Make sure Squall has no elemental junctions on his weapon

1) Get Squall as fast as possible--haste, speed etc.
2) Aura Squall somehow. or get him at low HP
3) make the other 2 characters busy (summon a GF or something)
4) Keep pressing the Circle button really fast until you hear the 
   little ring that signals a limit break (you may have to 
   practice this so you don't miss the ring). Use the limit break 
   quick! Don't miss your triggers!
5) Repeat 4 until the other two characters are done with their 
   action. When they are done with their actions make them busy 
   again and keep repeating 4.

Squall does the most damage with his limit break if he's at 1 HP...
so against Omega Weapon, wait for a Terra Break before you use Hero on 
him.

Otherwise, with this technique, EVERY BOSS is eliminated very easily...
INCLUDING Ultimecia. Omega is the only challenge.

Elynoles Extinction!
by Vox Necros <vox_necros@unforgettable.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sure-fire strategy can be done by juntioniong 100x Zombies to 
ST-Atk-J, which seems to have a 95% chance of zombying the Elynole. 
Then just cast Life on it, and *poof* you win. I've noticed that 
Phoenix Downs always seem to miss it, but haven't had a problem with 
the spell yet. I usually take the thing down before it even gets a 
chance to act, and my characters does have have Initiative ability 
equipped

Some of the strategies from the contributors. They are pretty efficient.
If you have a problem in battling a BOSS, I will add it here. Just 
submit the status (include GFs you have, level of your characters, name
of weapon) to me and I will try.

Armagedon Madness I: Defeating the GF Jumbo Cactaur 
by Akuma20000
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basics Requirements:
- Level 60. Have Zell in the party and have his HP keep at the critical
  status, yellow in color. Have tons of Phoenix Downs. Have the other
  characters with the item and Draw.
- Magic needed:
  100x Ultima - junctioned it to Zell's Str stats through Str-J. Triple 
  works quite well too. Get this from the draw points found at the 
  Island closest to Hell/Heaven and the draw point found at the second 
  floor of the windmill at FH. You can get a lot of this at the Shumi
  Village but it is rather costly.
  Meltdown - you can get that from the BOSS or you can get that by 
  drawing from Gayla.
  Slow - you can draw this magic from the Caterchipillar.
  Protect - most monsters have them, refer to Monsters section for more
  details. 
  Haste - draw from the GIM52A while at D-District Tower or the Iron 
  Giant.
  Curaga - draw from Caterchipillar while your characters are at 
  Level 60+. Mesmerize will be a preferred choice.
  Water - draw from the Grant Mantis. Stock 100x Water and junctioned
  to Elem-Atk-J. If Zell's Str Stats are 255, you can do 9999 HP damage!

Steps in defeating the Jumbo Cactaur
1. Draw Meltdown from the Cactaur and cast on the BOSS, this will 
   decrease the defensive stats of the Cactaur.
2. Have one character cast Slow on the Cactaur.
3. Have the others cast Triple and followed by Haste and Protect
4. Now just keep on using Zell's Limit Break [tap Circle repeatedly 
   until it appears and each of his hits will take over 1000+ and if 
   you're lucky, the rate of critical that will be about 3000+
5. Just using the normal moves, such as Punch Rush and Booya. Let's 
   say you can get 9 seconds for Zell's special technique and for each 
   second you get around 3 hits (each hit giving around 1500 damage) 
   that's a total of 4500 for 1 second and if you can get nine seconds, 
   Zell can easily cause around 40,000+ HP damage!
6. Meanwhile have the other two characters, for healing lost HP and 
   drawing. Don't bother to heal Zell and just keep him at critical
   status so that you can use his Limit Break each time. Just make
   sure that the other characters have maintained their HP above 3000
   (just in case, the Cactaur uses its elbow drop!) If Zell dies 
   just use a Phoenix Down or cast Life on him and that'll be enough

OTHER STUFFS
- This strategy isn't meant for people who want to beat the Cactaur
  at low levels. This method has only one aim, that's this consume 
  items and magic spells [such as precious Aura]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armagedon Maddness I: Defeating the Bahamut 
by Akuma 20000
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basics Requirements
- Have Zell at Level 60 and have him at critical status. Junction 
  powerful magic to boast up his Str stats. Equip Auto Haste and
  3x Initiative [each for one character..]
Magic needed:
- Slow -> Draw this magic from the Caterchipillar
  Meltdown -> Draw this magic from the Gayla
Steps in defeating the Bahamut
1. Cast Meltdown and Slow while have Zell doing his limit techniques.
   Kept everyone's HP above 4000+. You will be able to finish of the
   Bahamut with just two Limit Breaks [9 seconds... it is
   indeed a killer.] Have tons of Phoenix Down in your inventory.
   Meanwhile seize the opportunity to get spells such as Full-life.

The War against Jumbo Cactaur with Water
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you seen Squall does 9999 HP everytime, you uses the Attack 
Command? It is possible.. But you need to get the following ^_^;

Water - draw from the Grand Mantis found at the Lenown Plains. Get 100x
        of this and junction 100x Water to Elem-Atk-J. [well, the 
        Cactaur is weak against that.]
Revive - just in case the BOSS uses its 10,000 Needles.. The Revive 
         Command restore the character's HP back to full health!

Get Squall's Str stats to 255. [Ultima will be the best choice. If you
can't junction Str +20%, Str +40% to boost it to that status.] Have
Squall in Critical Status and you will see the might. I have defeat it 
with the Lion Heart as I have uses Irvine's Pulse Destruction and 
Zell's Armagedon Fist Madness. Lion Heart will be the top option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defeat the Odin in less than 3 minutes 
by Markweb Jimenez (markweb_3t@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, have Squall equipped with Str +20% and Str +40%. This will 
make Squall's Str stats to be increased by 60%! Next have him does 
attack [making him in critical status] and have him using his Limit 
Breaks on the Odin. You will be able to finish the Odin in a turn or 
two.. [this will help to conserve some precious Aura magic] There is a 
way of get Squall in critical status, first have Squall being killed in 
a battle. Next revive Squall with a Phoenix Down and you will be able to 
use Squall's Limit Break easily when you tap Circle repeatedly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gun-Destruction Fire against Bahamut
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course, you need the character that most people does not like most..
Irvine Kinneas. But he is relatively one of the most strongest as you 
used the ultimate level up technique (mentioned in the Miscellaneous 
section)

For Irvine.
100x Pulse Ammo - you can get Energy Crystal fast and easy... by defeat
the Elnoyle at Esthar City (refer to Monster Besitary for more info.)
100x AP Ammo - you can get this, by refine Chef's Knife through 
Ammo-RF.
100x Triple/Meteor/Ultima - this works well, if you junction to boost 
his Str-J.
100x Blind - draw from the Grat, or heck, search through the Besitary.
Junctioned it to other character's ST-Atk-J
Initative 

Have Irvine in critical status (aka. yellow HP.) and tap Circle 
repeatedly to use Limit Break. Note have him attack with a normal 
attack first to inflicit the Darkness status on the Bahamut. Next uses
his Limit Break. Start off with the AP Ammo and then the Pulse Ammo.
You will be able to finish it off within a minute...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy Defeat of Diablos (later stages.)
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diablos are indeed tough in the later stages. It has awesomely strong
attack against your characters.. (about 2000+ HP for that charge if you
battle it at Level 100). Junction 100x Blind and Sleep to each 
character's ST-Atk-J. Stock up Demi and use the "stocked" Demi and it
will counter with Curaga. Once your characters are on critical status,
attack with Limit Breaks and it is all over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defeating Adel (Disc 3)
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wonder why I keep on getting e-mails on how to defeat Adel? It was 
beginning to annoy me.. I guess I think I know what's wrong. Remember
that Adel has Rinoa being embedded in her? You can easily defeat her if
you concentrate on her and keep on maintaining Rinoa's HP. I guess the
guy's team will be fine for this battle. Have all GFs junctioned to all
the characters. Particularly make Zell's and Irvine's Str up to at least
190. [For Irvine get a lot of AP Ammo]. Just keep have Zell and Irvine
doing the Limit Breaks [Irvine: don't use his Flame Ammo and Shotgun 
Ammo as it will inflcit more of Rinoa and Adel]. Why not Squall as the
key attacking character? Occassionally he may unleash his Blasting 
Zone.. [remember it does 9999 HP..] Rinoa's HP is at only up to the
maximum as 9034... So do considerate and don't be too dependant on 
Squall. Instead have Squall as the healing party. [BTW, he can also be
a good healer!] I have notice a lot of people has problems in fighting
against Adel as due to low levels and low-level weapons... 

Solution:
- Make sure you have at least 3x HP-J and junctioned it with your second
  strongest magic. [Full-Life gives the highest boosting.. which you
  can stock it from Master Tonberry, Fujin [disc 3 at Lunatic Pandora],
  and Bahamut [he is a worm if you know its weakness..].
- Get as many Ultima to junctioned to either Zell or Irvine. They are 
  the best fighters besides Squall. Of course, you should have at least
  3x Str-J. Have Zell excute the Armageddon Fist.
- Get as many Curaga as possible. Life is more useful compared to 
  Full-Life as it gives your characters revived from K.O and in critical
  status. If you don't have Life, you better get Phoenix Downs. Always
  kept Squall in his highest HP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy Fight against Ultimecia
by Joshua Banker Rock Hill, SC (jbanker@kanawha.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Towards the end of the game, everyone should be maxed out with all the
GF abilities. Give everyone Auto-Potion and sell off anything that's 
weaker than an X-Potion. Make 100 X-Potions by using Med LV Up. Also, 
give one person Treatment and another member the Recover command. Don't
waste time with Revive. If you do things right, you won't need to 
Revive or even use a Phoenix Down. Make your party Squall (duh), Rinoa 
and Qusitis. 

A: Squall... two words, Lion Heart. Nuff said. 
B: Rinoa... Limit Breaks Wishing Star (massive amounts of damage) and 
   Invincible Moon (like a Woly War). C: 
C: Quistis... Mighty Guard and Shockwave Pulsar (obscene amounts of 
   damage, possibly the third or fourth most damaging attack in the 
   game).

To begin with, waste off anyone starting in the party who is not one of 
the three mentioned above, or let Ultimecia do it while you summon 
Doomtrain (for the Vit 0 effect if nothing else). Once you have all 
three up and running, cast Aura or use Aura stones on everyone and 
start hitting away.

Once the attacks start rolling in, Auto-Potion should kick in. This is
especially helpful when hit with Demi, Gravija and Maelstorm. Also, you
might want to use the Luck + 50% ability to raise you chances of 
getting Gilgamesh and the stronger Limit Breaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy Battle against Bahamut
by Sami "Elvenlord" Hautamaki (mustahaltia@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First put Ifrit to Squall and use Str bonus ability. Level Up in order 
to get more strength. Then change Str bonus to Str+20%, Str+40% and get 
HP +80% from Diablos. After that put strong magic to Hp-J (Meltdown is 
good) and very good magic to strength (Ultima is best to this. Get 100x 
of both magic.) Now you should have HP about 9000+ and massive strength 
of 255. Next put good weapon to Squall and give high HP and strength to 
Zell and Irvine.

How I fight. That's dead simple. Use Aura to Squall and use Limit Break. 
Make one or two perfect Limit Break and you should have one badly 
beaten GF. 

You can use this tactic to all other boss too. It's more effective if 
you give Zell and Irvine high strength stats and HP. They are the 
probably the only characters who can do multiple damage when using 
Limits.

Where to get Aura? You get them from Fury Fragments. 1x Fury Fragment 
can be changed to 5x Aura magic with Supt Mag-RF. It take some time but 
you can get lot of them when you are waiting that Ultima draw point to 
recharge. 

Hint. If character doesn't get limit change characters with O button 
      until they got it.

Easy Fight at Centra Ruins
by Christopher Ong Boon Siong (sci90140@nus.edu.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this to work get Odin first to remove the time limit. 
Junction to Squall the following: Attack, magic, item and GF only. 
To the 2 other characters: Attack, magic, item and GF. If you have 
recover and/or revive you can replace magic with them. Magic need only 
to be junction if you have Life or Full-life. Junction 100x Death to 
ST-Def-J. 

Basically the idea is to have Squall use his Limit Breaks constantly on 
the Tonberry by maintaining a low HP for Squall. As Squall's Limit Break
generally have a total damage hit of more than 9999 if you trigger it 
perfectly and with a chance to include a finishing blow. Thus it is much 
more damaging and faster than the GF Diablos animation. If Squall is 
killed, just use a Phoenix Down or use Life to revive him with the other 
2 characters. This method have another advantage being that Squall's 
Limit Break automatically jumps into battle the next turn even though 
it is not his turn yet. Thus you don't have to spend a long time to 
kill the 20 Tonberries. Just remember to save every time and then and 
definitely after the 19th Tonberry. The only danger is not saving and 
have your entire party killed. 

As for the Tonberry King, the above method can also be use but it is
recommended that the other 2 characters have full HP constantly to 
withstand the junk attack of the king, so as to be able to revive Squall 
after the attack or just alternate healing after the attack and GF 
attacks on the king when the entire party are at full life. 

I accquire the GF Tonberry after getting Odin before atttacking Galbadia
Garden and finished disc 2 with Squall at level 100 and with his 
Punishment, using both Zell (Ehergiz) and Quistis (Red Scorpion) for the
battle.

No woes in fighting Sorceress Edea!
by Shawn Nicholas (msshawn@mbox4.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A way to defeat Sorceress without being touched...  Just junction Sleep 
to ST-Atk-J in one of the character's weapons or cast Sleep on her. 
Boy, what can I say, Edea is sleepy.  She'll sleep throughout the battle 
and all you need is to do is to cast Diablos which drains about 3,000 to 
4,000 HP each turn. The funny thing is that, she still sleeps.. maybe 
under reaches her coffin!

Getting Diablos before the train trip
by Omega 2003 (omega_2003@hotmail.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diablos' vital statistics: HP: 9200 ~ 9400
Attacks: Demi > removes 1/4 of the character's HP
         Gravija > removes 1/4 of the entire party's HP
         (charge) > physical attack on one member.

Recommended Party: Squall, Selphie and Zell

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zell                        Command: Attack  GFs: Ifrit
HP-J        100x Esuna               Magic       - 100x Blind
Str-J       100x Fire                Draw
Elem-Atk-J  100x Thunder             GF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Squall                      Command: Attack  GFs: Siren, Quezacotl
HP-J        100x Esuna               Magic       
Mag-J       100x Blind               Draw 
ST-Atk-J    100x Sleep               Item
ST-Def-J    100x Silence
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selphie                     Command: Attack  GFs: Shiva
Str-J       100x Fire                Magic       - 100x Blind
Spr-J       100x Esuna               Draw        - Full-cure acquired
                                     Item
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just keep on casting Blind, until GF Diablos is under Darkness status.
Just draw in Demi magic and stocked until it is about 150+ Demi. While
drawing GF Diablos will be using his Gravija or casting Demi. Don't
heal your characters as these magics only reduces the HP. Once the
characters are in critical status, have Squall unleashes his 
Renzoukuken and Zell doing his Duel. While Selphie should be cast 
Full-cure on the entire party through her Slots Limit Breaks. Just
repeated the process and you will be able to kill off GF Diablos in
no time. Full-cure is essentially as there is an odd chance of GF 
Diablos using the charge..

Hints: stock Blind from the BOSS Fight against Granaldo
       stock Fire from Elite Soldiers, G-Soldiers during Dollet exam
       stock Esuna from Biggs while battling at Communications Tower
       stock Silence and Sleep from Grat found in Balamb Garden-
       Training Center.

Easy defeat of GF Diablos with GF Carbuncle
by PokemonWI@aol.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't want any risk in fighting this mean GF. Just get GF 
Carbuncle which can be drawn from Iguions. Demi can be reflected by
the Ruby Light! But make use you uses item as your healing items so that
you will not lose out that much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Foolproof against Adel
by Jason Kennedy (leeann1013@juno.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to defeat Adel at level 40. With a party combination of
Squall (at level 41), Selphie (at level 21), and Irvine (at level 23)
To beat Adel at such a low level, Cerberus must be cast, and you must 
have at least 50 Cure spells (preferably Curaga) with each player. A 
Cure spell must also be cast on Rinoa every so often. Ok, here is how 
you do it...

1) Cast Cerberus
2) Cast Haste on all three players (repeat this when necessary)
3) Have Squall do the attacking
4) Have the other 2 players cast Thundaga or Firaga
5) Cast Curaga when necessary

I only had one character die once with this method, and that was 
because I didn't cure when I should've. It seems pretty foolproof.

Defeating the Weapons                                         ffviii_083
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Weapons are the most toughest BOSSES in Final Fantasies as the 
nightmares such as the Diamond, Ruby, Ultimate, Emerald and Sapphire 
Weapon from FF7 and Omega Weapon from FF5. I myself have come up with 
some strategies. Whom is going into the battles? Actually for myself, 
I believed that every character is good! 

----[ Character Analysis ]----

Squall Leonhart
Of course you don't have the choice of not using him. But he is indeed 
a great character and perhaps the most damaging Limit Break (physical) 
when you have gotten his Lion Heart. Extremely dangerous if you have 
junctioned his Str to 255. How to get Lion Heart, refer to Part II or
the Weapon Upgrading Guide (sigh..)

Zell Dincht 
Don't look down on this super hyperactive kid. He has great Speed 
stats and can does a handful amount of damage when you chain his 
moves when executing his Limit Break. Hmm.. Armageddon Fists.. (the
chain between Punch Rush and Booya)

Irvine Kinneas 
The most well-rounded character with decent attacking power and 
defense stats. He could easily knocked down any formidable foe if you 
have Pulse Ammo in the inventory. Best if you have junction Drain to 
his ST-Atk-J! He can be a superb character if you have train him with
Cactaur junctioned with all the bonuses. Simply a dangerous man..

Quistis Trepe 
She is also a great character plus she has a move [Mighty Guard] that 
could cause Haste, Protect, Float, Shell, Regen and sometimes Aura! 
Best of all, her Shockwave Pulsar could does over 9999 HP damage to all 
foes! Monsters (except for certain monsters such as Tonberry) have the
most fear for her Degenerator.

Selphie Tilmitt 
Probably the best support character. Even though her offense isn't 
great compared to Quistis, but she could make something like cast 
Full Cure and Wall on the entire party. She can does more damage with 
her awesome trademark "The End". However her Rapture does not work 
that well... Her Strange Vision has an amazing hit rate of 255%!

Rinoa Heartilly 
I would recommend her if you does have enough Hero. Make sure that you 
have acquired Invincible Moon and Angelo will be able to cast 
Invincibility on the entire party. Her Angelo Cannon is also rather 
massive, could does over 9999 HP damage when she has acquired high
levels.

I myself have made the following combinations (they may not 100% 
worked, so don't sue me ^_^;) but most of them worked for me. 

Top Combinations of Party!   
___________________________________________________________________
|          |          |          |          |          |          |
|  Squall  |  Squall  |  Squall  |  Squall  |  Squall  |  Squall  |
|  Irvine  |  Quistis |  Selphie |  Zell    |  Zell    |  Irvine  |
|  Zell    |  Rinoa   |  Rinoa   |  Rinoa   |  Quistis |  Selphie |
|__________|__________|__________|__________|__________|__________|

ESSENTIAL WEAPONS                
Preferred if you have gotten their best weapons. Lion Heart is a must 
when battling against Weapons. Refer to The Weapon Upgrading section 
for more details. I myself think that characters such as Zell and 
Irvine will not be great if they does have their ultimate weapons. I 
have noticed that the better the weapon, the better the hit rate. 

ESSENTIAL MAGIC
Magic is really important.. if you don't have them, your attacking
power will not be too good.. So here is the list where you will get
the spells.

<<< Curaga >>>
An important factor for tough battles as they could recover most of 
damage. Make sure that all characters have them. You can get this by 
drawing from Mesmerize at high levels or Caterchipillar.

<<< Meltdown >>> 
This magic can lowers the defensive stats of the BOSS, thus weakening 
them. For example, if Squall inflicts 4000+ HP damage with his 
Renzoukuken, now when Meltdown is being cast on that foe, he can do up 
6,000+ damage. You can obtain this spell by drawing from Gayla.

<<< Full-life >>>
This magic is great as it could revive a death character back to full 
health. You can get tons of these from the Draw Points found at the 
borders of the Island closest to Hell/Heaven. You can also stock up 
this from your fights against the King Tonberry and the Bahamut.

<<< Aura >>> 
A very important magic. This magic will allows you to unleash the 
character's Limit Breaks! You can get this from the Draw Points found 
at the borders of the Islands closest to Hell/Heaven. You can also 
stock up during the last battle against Seifer at the Lunatic Pandora.

<<< Haste >>>
It is impossible to have three Spd +40% [if you are willing to sacrifice 
Irvine's Card..], This magic will do it's best as you will be able to do 
a lot of turns before the Weapons have reaches their turns. You can 
draw this from the Iron Giant and GIM52A 

<<< Regen >>>
This magic allows you to restore HP once the character have reached his/
her turn and this magic works its best against the Omega. You can draw 
this spell from the Behemoths. Quite good support [however I still 
prefer the previous Regen where it restores 1 HP for every second..]

<<< Ultima >>>
Used for junctioning to your characters' stats thus bolstering them up. 
You can get most of these from the Draw Points found at the borders of 
the Island closest to Hell/Heaven or pay 5,000 gil at the Shumi Tribe 
[where you find the elevator]. There is another one found the second 
floor of the windmill in FH.

<<< Triple >>>
Quite a good spell in bolstering your character's abilities. You can 
draw this from the BOSSES fight against Cerberus and the Odin. You can 
get this magic by converting 5 Double Magic to 1 Triple Magic through 
Hi-Mag-RF Menu ability [Alexander]. You can get Double magic by drawing 
from Grendel. It works like the All Materia in FF7

<<< Meteor >>>
Quite a good spell when comes to junction against the character's Str 
stats. You can get this by drawing from the Ruby Dragon. I would 
recommend to draw from the draw points found at the Island Closest to
Hell/Heaven.

<<< Death >>>
You need this spell to protect your characters from death-type attacks 
such as LV 5 Death [Level 100 characters will die instantly.] You can 
draw this from the Tonberry.

Essential GFs [don't bother to summon it unless the character has high
compatibility against it, use GF comptability items to do this. To 
improve comptability such as Eden, summoned them frequently!]
________________________________________________________________________
GFs FOR Squall Leonhart
<> Cerberus --- of course you have seen it appearing in most parts of
   my strategies against BOSSES. Actually while fighting against 
   Weapons, there is no need in summoning it but make sure that it has
   the following abilities:
   - Auto Haste (c), Spd +40% (c), Spd-J (j), ST-Def x4 (j)
<> GF Quezacotl, Shiva, Bahamut, Tonberry
   - HP-J, Mag-J, Str-J, Str +60%, Mag +60%, Auto Protect, Ability x4, 
     Initiative, Vit J [make sure that it has hit at least 200]
________________________________________________________________________
GFs FOR Second Character [the character whom has lower Speed stats]
<> Pandemona -- Another great GF when comes to Speed. This fact actually 
   allows your characters to select his/her commands before the BOSSES 
   does its turn.
   - Spd +40% (c), Initiative (c), Str-J (j)
<> GF Brothers, Alexander, Carbuncle, Doomtrain
   - HP +80%, HP-J, Vitality J, Revive, Ability x3, ST-Def x4, Str-J
________________________________________________________________________
GFs FOR Third Character [the character whom has higher Speed stats]
<> Cactaur -- Another great GF which can helps in building up a 
   strong character with all bonuses such as Str Bonus, HP Bonus
   and much more. Train the character with Vit Bonus equipped.
   - Initiative (c)
<> GF Ifrit, Diablos, Leviathan, Siren
   - HP-J, Str-J, HP +80%, [Enc-None], Str +40%, 
     ST-Def x2 (junction against Death), Ability x4 (use a 
     Rosetta Stone if you have one, just eliminate SumMag +10%
     from any following GFs), Recover, Mag-J

Speed Battle against Ultima Weapon
By Sung Kato (ssj3kato@hotmail.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way to tackle the weapons is to acquired Squall's Lion Heart [
his ultimate weapon which can does 17x 9999 HP damage to any foe at the
Str Stats of 255.] Don't bother in summoning GFs because even though 
they does damage, but now that your characters can do comparable damage. 
Summoning a GF requires time, and speed is the key to victory in 
defeating the Weapons. Start the battle by cast Meltdown [all your 
character's ATB Time Bar should be full as you can automatically 
selects the command immediately as you started the battle. Cast Haste 
on the characters with the lowest Speed stats. Have Squall or someone 
else casting Aura on Squall and have him does the Renzoukuken. If your 
party is being hurt by the Ultima Weapon, use Recover to restore lost 
HP and cast Full-Life on death characters [which can be drawn from the 
BOSS]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Light of War
By Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speed is everything for this war.. Junction 100x Ultima to Squall's 
Str-J and make sure it is 255. Make full use Lion Heart as it will be
the most damaging attack. Junction 100x Quake to all character's 
Elem-Def-J. Make sure that you have all GFs (except for Eden or you can
get that....) Okay make sure you have a couple of Aura magic or Aura 
Stones. It is very important. How to get Aura, scroll to the essential
magic section.

- Give every character Initative (from Tonberry, Cactaur, Pandemona)
- Junction Spd-J for every characters (Auto-Haste is a top option for
  Squall) 
- 1000 compatibility with Cerberus for Squall. 
- Juntion 100x Quake to every characters' Elem-Def-J.
- Make sure you have aleast 50x Regen, Aura, Meltdown.
- If you have gotten Quistis, make sure you have Mighty Guard. and she
  must be in critical status.
- 50x Mega Phoenix in your inventory or Phoenix Down. Phoenix Pinion 
  is essentail in case of accident ^_^;

Starting off...
- Cast Mighty Guard or having in this sequence.
  Summon Cerberus and have the two character cast Meltdown on Ultima
  and the other character cast Regen on all characters.
- Next turn, cast Aura and Curaga to restore lost HP from the sword
  swipe attack. Use Phoenix Down (if one character is down) or Mega
  Phoenix if other two characters are down.
- Once in Aura, use Squall's Renzoukuken... Continue to have other do
  the healing [Zell and Irvine can also join in the fight too, but 
  make sure at least one of them do the healing]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultima Weapon to be finished in 2 minutes.
by BoBaFeT & Sephiroth <bobafetlonestar@yahoo.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you must have Aura magic. Next you must have Irvine in 
your party. You also need to have AP Ammo which you can buy this in
Esthar. You must use Aura in battle on Irvine this way he will get his 
Limit Break every time you can choose him. Now you must use AP Ammo and 
you will shoot 9999 points of damage every time you shoot on the Ultima
Weapon. Irvine's strength must be 255.

/ Omega Weapon \________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defeating The Omega Weapon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nightmare from FF5 is back.. more powerful and it's a killer. When
I first play against it in the Japanese Version, I thought that it was
just like the Ultima (not that though).. but surprising it is a killer.
My party HP is less than 9999 as I have just fought the Tiamat.. Here
you will find the strategy to kill it! If you defeat it, you will find
the Proof of Omega.

Easy Ultima Cheat.
- You CAN run from the Omega! Just have 100x Triple to Spd-J (from GF 
  Cerberus and Pandemona) plus an Auto-Haste for last character. Give
  them the draw command and have them keep on drawing Ultima from the
  Omega. Have 100x Death junctioned to ST-Def-J. Once it does the LV
  5 Death attack, run after it has been excuted as the Omega will
  compile his remaining attacks.

Some Shocking statistics:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Omega Weapon 
Level 100 HP: 1,161,000 (if Squall's Level is 100)
              Str 255! Mag 255! (well, quite shocking huh?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attack List of the Omega Weapon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
LV5 Death (all)
Description: A devil rises from the ground and attacks all characters.
Damage:      n/a (if fully protected), Extreme (if not protected)
Avoid:       Anyone with levels,multiple of 5 will be killed. Junction
             100x Death to ST-Def-J to prevent this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meteor (all)
Description: The characters are being transported into space and thus 
             a meteorite shower is formed.
Damage:      Average
Avoid:       Just simply increase Vit-J and Spr-J
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultima (all)
Description: A green ball of energy appears just like a explosion of
             energy.
Damage:      High
Avoid:       Increase Mag Def by junction magic to Spr-J
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gravija (all)
Description:  The Omega Weapon summons a black ball of Gravity energy
              that attacks all members.
Damage:       Medium ~ Extreme
Avoid:        Can't but he is helping you to get critical status ^_^;,
              But make sure that your character's HP are kept at its
              fullest!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Light Pillar <Licht Saule> (single)
Description:  The Omega Weapon launches a beam of light energy from its
              torso. (rapid firing)
Damage:       9999 HP, Danger!
Avoid:        Use a 9999 HP GF as your block shield.. Or resurrect your
              characters using Mega Phoenix or Phoenix Down. 
              Invincibility from Hero works well..
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Megido Flame <Megid Flamme> (all)                                    
Description:  The Omega fires a beam that attacks all characters.
Damage:       9998 HP to all characters, Extreme
Avoid:        Same as above. But it will be better if you have some 
              Phoenix Pinion in your inventory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terra Break <Terra Brake> (all)
Description:  The Omega leaps in mid-air and blast down with flames of
              energy on the entire party. 
Damage:       Does random, multiple hits. Medium to Extreme damage.
Avoid:        Very hard to dodge. High Vit can minimize the damage to 
              200 HP only.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditions:
- All characters' HP must be 9999 HP.
- Get all GFs to Level 100.
- Get 3x ST-Def-J.
- Get 100x Ultima for each character and junctioned to Str-J. Add some
  Str +20%, Str+40%, Str+60%, to reached 255.
- Get aleast 2x Phoenix Pinion - you can get more through the following
  method. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Phoenix Pinions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why need this? You are facing the toughest BOSS in FF8 and you need to
guarrantee that you can stay in the battle for a long time.

(1) 50x Phoenix Down -> 1x Mega Phoenix [or buy at Esthar Shop]
(2) Get 3x Mega Phoenix [use Quick Gil Cheat... refer to Part II]
(3) Convert it Phoenix Pinion (3 Mega Phoenix :1 Phoenix Pinion) through
    Tool-RF (GF Siren)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Holy War (it is rather tedious..)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah.. This is rather tedious. You need to get a lot of items (
especially Cursed Spikes) where you can get Heroes through several 
refinement sections. However, there is an alternate way and that is
through Card Mod-RF where you can change: 
BTW, a Holy War is equalvent to 3x Heroes..

Card Mod-RF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gilgamesh's Card: 1x -> 10x Holy Wars
Laguna's Card: 1x -> 100x Heroes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tough way..... (extremely tedious)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In summarising, you need to get 10,000 Cursed Spikes to get 1x Holy War!

(1) Get 100x Cursed Spike (win from Imp [rare], Forbiddon [rare], 
    Tri-Face)
(2) Convert 100x Cursed Spike in 1x Dark Matter through Tool-RF (GF
    Siren must be at Level 100)
(3) Tool-RF List (GF Siren) 
    1x Rosetta Stone --> 1x Shaman Stone (Water Gate Incident)
    1x Hungry Cookpot --> 1x Shaman Stone (UFO Incident)
    1x Mog's Amulet --> 1x Shaman Stone (Pocketstation)
    1x Dark Matter --> 1x Shaman Stone (the tedious method..)
Scott: "Don't be shocked.."
(4) Forbid Med-RF (GF Doomtrain)
    10x Shaman Stone --> 1x Holy War Trial (^_^; feel like crying huh?)
Scott: "The next step will make you vomit blood"
(5) Med LV-Up (GF Alexander)
    10x Holy War Trial -> 1x Holy War

So in "5" steps you can get a Holy War ^_^;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now you will know the importance of the Card Game? The Pocketstation
also plays a vital role in the game, as you can get these items easily..

Speed Battle against Omega Weapon
by Sung Kato (ssj3kato@hotmail.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This method works with the Offensive Team [Squall, Zell and Irvine]
Have Zell as the healer for this battle. Make sure that everyone has
100x Death being junctioned to the character's ST-Def-J. Make sure that 
both Irvine and Squall's Str stats has hit 255. First of all, have Zell 
casting Triple on himself, have the rest does the attacking. Have Zell
cast Aura on the entire party. Next have Squall and Irvine executing 
their Limit Breaks. Meanwhile, have Zell cast Haste on the entire 
party. Continue your attacks until the party's HP have drop to one.. 
Next have Irvine casting Recover on Squall while Zell [whom have Mag 
255] casting Curaga on Irvine and himself. If the Omega has killed one 
of the members, revive him with Revive or Full-Life [if you use Life/
Phoenix Down/Mega Phoenix, has that character summon a HP 9999 GF to 
withstand the damage for him. Continue your endurance and you will be 
able to trash the Omega.

The Extreme Combat
by Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*EVERYONE'S HP MUST REACHED 9999 **
Members required: Squall, Quistis and Zell
Others: - 100x Ultima junctioned to Str and get 255 for both Squall and 
          Zell.
        - Get about 40x Aura
        - 100x Death and junctioned it to ST-Def-J
        - 100x Triple or high affection with GF Cereberus. (refer above)
        - 100x Haste 
        - Mighty Guard (use Barrier (steal from Behemoth)
        - 3x Intitative (Pandemona, Cactaur, Tonberry)
        - Lion Heart (ugh.. if someone asked me about this.. I gonna to
          kill him. Explain a couple of times already...)

Start off..
(1) - Cast Aura on everyone.
(2) - Have Quistis cast Mighty Guard. Squall using Renzoukuken and Zell
      uses Armageddon Fist. [Switch turns, don't have both to attack at
      the same time.]
(3) - Omega should be casting the Lv5 Death already. Cast Regen on 
      everyone. (hopefully that you are lucky..) Have Squall continue 
      attacking. 
(4) - Omega will now be casting the Meteor. STOP Attack! Use Recover and
      Curaga and keep HP to its maximum.
(5) - Omega will be using its Megid Flamme which does 9998 HP. Use a
      Megalixir/Recover/Mega Phoenix (if someone's killed)
(6) - The Omega may switch its combat tactics from now onwards.. So be
      carefully of Gravijia. Again use Recover and Curaga to restore
      back to full health. If it uses Licht Scale.. revive that 
      character immediately. It has to be a 3 on 1 fight. 
(7) - Next the Omega will uses a series of spells such as Ultima, 
      Demi to attack. So seize the opportunity, still have Quistis as
      the support member.
(8) - Once the Omega has uses Lv5 Death once again.. it is back to
      (1). Keep up the edurance and you will be able to beat it!

Rush Hour.. Holy War Attack!
by squal.leonheart@eudoramail.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly you have to level up all GFs and characters until it reached 
level 100 and the GFs have learned all the abilities (not necessarily), 
and you must have gotten the best weapon. 
After that, junction the GF to your character as you wish, try to get HP 
with 9999, in example; here is the character i've used,

Zell at HP 9999 and level 100
Squall at Level 100 and his best weapon Lion Heart
Irvine with hp 9999 and level 100

Don't junction Eden to Squall, because Squall's only attacking arsenal 
is his Limit Break. Remember that, you must have a lot of Holy Wars, 
which you can obtained from by using Card Mod on Gilgamesh card.
Get a lot of Aura spells which can be gotten through Supt Mag-RF [1x
Fury Fragment [mugged from Blue Dragon] --> 5x Aura]

During battle,
The first thing you do, cast Aura onto Squall and have the other use 
Holy Wars and another summon a GF [note: you must cast Aura to Squall 
first before using the Holy Wars, if your magic will cause a miss)
After that, continue with Squall unleash his Limit Breaks and summon GF 
Eden without worry getting hit with the enemy. But don't forget to cast 
Aura on Squall again, after the effect of Holy Wars have worn off, and 
used another Holy War. Keep on continuing using this pattern, and the
Omega will be dead meat in no time..

Fighting Omega without Aura
by oDiN (Dino_de_la_Rama@yahoo.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. All you need is your three best characters (I really don't care who,
   besides Squall and Zell of course) equipped with Initiative and the 
   BEST junctions (probably all best magic junctioned to Spd-J, Str-J, 
   Spr-J, Eva-J and Vit-J). 

2. Characters at Level 100 and 100 Deaths at St-Def-J and at least 
   everyone must have the Item command and Holy War as first selection 
   in the Battle. 

3. EXTREMELY LOW HP (probably 800-1000 HP is enough) but be sure that 
   your characters have their max base HP (1000/9999). Remember this: 
   you want Zell's 12-second Duel, Squall's Lion Heart and Irvine's 
   slow Time Bar do you? And since you may want the idea of not 
   wasting any Aura spells because it's junctioned to a stat, a low HP 
   increases the chances of a better Limit Break rather than an Aura 
   spell (heck, its my opinion)

4. A couple of Holy Wars or Rinoa's Invincible Moon (for the holy wars:
   Card Mod Laguna card, then Med Lev Up all 100 Heroes into 10 Holy 
   War-Trials, then 10 Holy War-Trials into 1 Holy War or Card Mod 
   Gilgamesh card for 10 Holy Wars).

5. Speedy characters but leave a weak character because you want him/
   her to do the Holy War thingies and probably a cast of Meltdown to 
   lower Omega's vitality stats (junction 100 Triple to Spd-J plus a 
   couple of Spd+% percentages, it's up to you plus the Initiative 
   ability for all three characters from Pandemona, Cactuar and 
   Tonberry).

START THE FIGHT!!!

If Omega Weapon will use a Physical Attack at the start of the fight:
Answer : Junction lots to Vit-J plus lots of Vit+% percentages and lots
         to Spd-J and Eva-J if you don't have Vit-J junction. 
If Omega will use LV5 Death at the start of the fight:
Answer : Junction 100 Death to St-Def-J beforehand or any level that's 
         not a multiple of 5.

1. Use this character lineup:
   First : your average fighter, probably a support member for using 
           Holy Wars and casting Life/Phoenix Downs/Mega Phoenix
   Second : Squall
   Third : your next strongest fighter, also a speedy, but fighting, 
           character

2. Your first member must use the Holy War (scrap Aura, you'll have 
   low HP and higher chances of a stronger limit break).

3. Heck, you know what to do right now, do you? If not, cast Meltdown, 
   then LION HEART! DUEL! SHOT! Those interactive Limit Breaks can 
   surely bring Omega Weapon down easily.

4. If you lose Invincibility status, use any of your characters to 
   Holy War (you have speedy characters, so you may outrun Omega 
   Weapon's attacks before he uses the deadly Mendigo Flame (9998 
   damage) or Terra Break (meteor-like attack that deals 5000-9000).

5. Well, that's about it! Just repeat these four steps and Omega'll 
   go down fast. (Lousy suggestion : since you'll be gaining 250 AP 
   afterwards, I suggest that you move Eden's learning to Expend-3x1, 
   that is if you're not done researching all those high-priced 
   abilities. Lousy, isn't it? :)

NOTE that you can _lower_ the damage done by the Terra Break IF you 
     junction to 255 Spirit (magic defense). One time Krysta (the 
     crystal boss in the balcony at the back room of the chandelier) 
     casted Ultima on me and did about 200 damage!

ALSO NOTE that above I said 'the BEST junctions (probably all best 
magic junctioned to Spd-J, Str-J, Spr-J, Eva-J and Vit-J)'. It's 
actually optional to junction to Eva-J and Spr-J/Vit-J but it's 
better to play safe in case you lose Invincibility status and Omega 
suddenly attacks you.

Defeat Omega at Ease
by SnowBall87@aol.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Refer to Power Up with Bonuses for the preparations section

After fighting him several times I think I found a pretty good strategy
that works. You need to refine the Gilgamesh card to get 10 holy wars,
Laguna too if you want extra insurance. This strategy is a bit risky 
but overall it kills him fast and is easy to pull off. Simply go into 
battle with Squall at about 400 or 500 hp to eliminate the need to 
cast Aura on him (and he seems more likely to pull off Lion Heart the 
lower his HP are). When the battles starts have the first character 
cast haste on Squall and the second character cast meltdown on Omega 
and then the third use Holy War. Then just hit round after round of 
Renzouken. Squall doesn't seem to like using Lion Heart on Omega Weapon
so don't expect him to use it too much. Of the three times I fought 
Omega Squall only used Lion Heart once. The Holy War seems to wear off 
of Squall before the others using this strategy so either use Hero on 
him or just use another Holy War. You should only have to use 3 or 4 
Holy Wars because Squall can get in about 5 or 6 limit breaks every 
Holy War.

Gameshark Codes                                               ffviii_084
========================================================================
After looking into other great FAQs written by other authors, it seems 
that a great FAQ can't do without a list of decent Gameshark codes. 
Anyway surprisingly, my version of GameShark still works! I have managed
to put some of the codes to work. For the codes to work, you need to
input them by using a Gameshark. How to input codes? Refer to your 
manual ^_^; The following codes are the courtesy of Gameshark Codes 
Creator Club and here is the URL:

http://www.cmgsccc.com/psx/ff8/ -check here for the full list.

Card Modifier Codes
Cards are extremely hard to get and you can have them in your inventory
effortless by inputting the 117 codes for those whose Gameshark is 
older than version 2.2. Gameshark users (version 2.2 and above) should
use the Ultimate card code, just to save time!

Item Modifier Codes 
I know that getting rare items are "extremely" time consuming. Anyway,
I have found a great modifier list from the above-named site. This also 
includes items that you can gotten from the Pocketstation! I have also
added some of my experience.

* MiniMog Command will results nothing if GF MiniMog is not unlocked.
* Chicbo will not be summoned if you haven't "summon" GF Chicobo in a 
  Chocobo Forest

Notes:
With the following codes, you don't need to have the item, or quantity
in the position you are modifying. 

Here is the list of 198 slots of the Item menu.

Choco World [Mini-Pocketstation Guide]                        ffviii_085
========================================================================
Please read this before proceeding on:
This section is formerly written by The Saint <saintly@innocent.com>,
which has been edited by me to suit the FAQ's format. If you have any
enquire regarding the Pocketstation section of the game, please contact
the Saint at saintly@innocent.com. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's a Pocketstation?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sony SCPH-4000 Pocketstation is a special memory card for the Sony 
Playstation. Like the standard card, it holds 15 blocks of regular data.
In addition to that, it has a small screen (32x32 pixels) and can run
programs that are designed to work with the game. For people who are 
interested, it uses an ARM7TDMI Thumb processor chip developed by Atmel 
Corp. (San Jose, CA) which manufactures many chips for mobile products 
and other Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), including the ARM7 and the 
StrongARM RISC processors. The processor is a 32-bit RISC chip with 
contains the CPU, flash memory, RAM, LCD controller, D/A converter (for 
controlling a speaker) and IrDA communication system. It has 2k of SRAM 
(for executing programs) and 128k of Flash RAM (holds the memory card 
data; programs also use it store their data as well).

It is powered by a standard Cr2032 watch battery. The biggest drain on
the battery life is, of course, the LCD screen. Chocobo World can run 
for at least 5-6 months without needing a battery replacement under 
normal conditions, but leaving some screens displayed (i.e. screen is 
all black with the 'Event!' message) can drain the battery 10 times as 
fast.

Sony released the Pocketstation in Japan in Dec 98, but cancelled a 
scheduled US release due to manufacturing difficulties. For now, the 
only way to get on in the US is to order it from a console import shop 
like National Console Support (http://www.ncsx.com). That is where I 
ordered mine. They charge about $50. Since the release was cancelled, 
most US games have removed support for it if there was any in the 
original Japanese title. So far, only 'Final Fantasy 8', 'Street Fighter 
Alpha Zero' and 'Ridge Racer' english titles support this device. 
Moreover, Street Fighter must be unlocked with a GameShark to support 
this feature. Don't expect to be using the Pocketstation for much 
besides FF8.

You can choose one of two spiffy colors; White or Crystal (clear).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfering Data to the Chocobo World
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you get a 'Chicobo' in the main Final Fantasy 8 game (directly
after you catch a Chocobo by yourself for the first time in any Chocobo 
Forest), you can play Choco World. The earliest you can really do this 
is near the beginning of Disc 2 after you have can cross over the ocean.

Once you have the Chicobo, go to the 'Save' screen of the menu, and 
select 'Chocobo World'. The first time you do this, the game will tell 
you that you need to initialize the pocketstation. If you select "Yes", 
Chocobo World will be transferred to the Pocketstation. Since you cannot 
have more than one 'Chocobo World' game on the pocketstation at a time, 
this will erase any previous games. The new game of Chocobo World will 
be assigned a new weapon (usually 2211), given it's own ID (usually the 
last three digits of the Pocketstation's unique ID) and also given a 
random hidden ID number. This is the number transmitted as the 'header' 
during a vs. battle.

From there on, you can play the game. FF8 will direct you to also save 
your game before you exit the save screen. This is important because of 
the hidden ID number; FF8 will not let you import data from a 
Pocketstation that does not match this number! 

Your Chocobo can begin its adventure in the pocketstation, collect items 
for you, and gain levels and power. To import all this data back into 
your FF8 game, go to the save screen again, select Chocobo world. Next
select the option "Home" to bring all the collected items and the state 
of the Chocobo back to the FF8 game. Select "World" to send him back to 
the Pocketstation. When the chocobo is in the pocketstation, he cannot 
be summoned with Gysahl Greens and the MiniMog ability won't work in the
FF8 game. When he is in the FF8 game, you cannot play Chocobo World on
the Pocketstation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started at the Chocobo World
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is something of a plot to the game, but it's not all that deep
(Hey! What did you expect out of 32x32 pixels?). In the first part of
the game, you are supposedly trying to find your friend Mog (a moogle,
like the ones in FF7). Later on you have to rescue this female Chocobo
that you've only ever seen twice before. After you do that, the game is
pretty much over, although you can wander around forever and collect
items to send back to FF8.  

Boko (the name of your Chocobo if you didn't change it, I named him
Spike), wanders around in the desert most of the time (well, he seems 
to sleep most of the time in my games, grr...). You can see his 
handsome self walking around.  The direction he is facing (and the 
direction the dots are going on the ground) tell you which way he is 
headed. If you press Enter at this screen, you can see a map. The 
square is the map you are walking on. The flashing dot is you, the solid 
dots are 'Events'. The big arrow on the right is the direction you are 
headed, and under the map is the level you are on and the current time.  

Look at the map and steer Boko towards a black Event dot (NOTE: you
cannot do this on the map!  Press Enter to leave the map and go to the
walking screen, then use the direction buttons to guide Boko toward a
dot). Boko runs faster if you hold down the button in the direction that
you want to go. Running off one side of the map will put you on the 
other side (is each level a sphere or something?)  

Hitting a dot will give you an 'Event'. There are a few kinds of Events
that you can hit:
    
1. Battles (most common) - Boko fights a monster
2. Moomba  (about 10%)   - A Moomba appears and offers you a weapon
3. Cactaur (about 10%)   - A Cactuar appears and gives you an item
4. Special Event         - Depends on level and settings

Because this is a boring game, Boko gets bored too. After a while of
wandering around, he will get distracted with something else and will
stop walking. There are several other activities he'll do:

- Listen to a portable radio
- Eat a picnic lunch
- Fishing
- Watching a TV
- Sitting around a campfire with Moomba

(The minimized screen says '???' during any of these)

There is also a percentage chance per each step that he will go to sleep
on his own. It seems to be based on how damaged he is. If he is at 1 HP, 
he will probably sleep when he moves onto the next map square. He 
regains HP while sleeping or doing any of the other activities listed 
above. If he is on Rank 2-6, he regains 4 HP every few seconds, on Rank 
1 he regains 5 HP. After a minute or two of sleeping with full HP or 
doing one of the other activities, he will wake up and keep going on his 
journey. While sleeping, the minimized screen says 'Zzz...". While 
fighting or walking on the map, the screen says 'Walking'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weapons
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All 'weapons' are just a series of four numbers. When you hit someone 
in the battle, one of the numbers is selected randomly and that is how 
much damage you do. So, to make an obvious point, the average damage 
you will do with any weapon can be figured by adding up all four numbers 
and dividing by 4. A 5544 weapon does an average damage of 4.5, and is 
thus more powerful than a 9111 (ave. damage 3.0). The best weapon you 
can get is based on your Rank.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Class of Items in Chocobo World
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are four categories of items; called, oddly enough A items, B 
items, C items and D items. When you import back into the FF8 game, each 
A/B/C/D item becomes one or more real items in the FF8 game. D items 
become cheap stuff like condition curing items and the M-Stone Pieces. 
C items become slightly better stuff, like Potions, Hi Potions, a few of 
the weaker GF ability items (like Turtle Shells, Healing Mail, etc..) 
and some of the stronger junk items. B items become the best GF ability 
items (including cool stuff, like Three Stars, Rosetta Stones, Moon 
Curtains), rare items (Malboro Tentacles, Inferno Fangs), and even 
unique items (Girl Next Door, Solomon's Ring, Magical Lamp) and the 
various power-up items (Str Up, Mag Up, etc..). Yup, that's right 
buckaroos; you can get the solomon ring and all the items you need to 
summon Doomtrain in disc 2! A items become the best B items.

Some items I have never gotten outside of the pocketstation are:

- Ribbon: Gives GF the 'Ribbon' ability (immunity to all status changes)
- Mog Amulet: Gives GF the 'MiniMog' ability (heals GF during battle)
- Friendship: Use item for 'MoombaMoomba' attack; lowers enemy to 1Hp!
- Chocobo Tag: Rename the chocobo

Some notable really rare items that you can get:

- Rosetta Stones
- Power Generators, Dark Matter (for Quistis' Blue Magic, 'B'/'A' items)
- Samantha Soul, Energy Crystal, Gaea's Ring, Diamond Armor ('B' items)
- Hero and Hero-Trial (rare 'B' items!)
  
Thanks to <HuskerCubs@aol.com> for sending me a list of how the items 
are determined (for the PC version of Chocobo World). This seems to be 
accurate for the Pocketstation game too, but some things may be off. He
pointed out that you can also get some items not listed here, like Pulse
Ammo and (Hi-)Potion+. I have also gotten Hero-Trials. I thought I had
gotten a 'Holy War-trial' item, but it was a mistake. I haven't ever 
gotten another after thousands of items imported, so I don't think it 
is possible.

Each time an item is brought in, a random number 1-64 is generated with
each number being mapped to an item. Often, a range of numbers is 
mapped to one item to make an item more common. So if an item has a 2/64 
chance, then 2 numbers out of 64 can end up to be that item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battles in Chocobo World
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battles in Chocobo World are fairly simple. Your Chocobo appears on the
right side of the screen, the monster on the left. The monster you get 
in the battle is related to the map you are on. They don't really have
names, but they look like some monsters in the FF8:

Level  1-100: Creep (Monster A)       , HP is Map Level/5 +6
Level 10-100: Vampire Bat (Monster B) , HP is Map Level/5 +8
Level 30-100: Blobra (Monster C)      , HP is Map Level/5 +10
Level 70-100: Wendigo (Monster D)     , HP is Map Level/5 +16

The monster's HP appears on the left, yours is on the right. In the
middle of the bottom portion of the screen are two numbers counting down 
to 0. When one of the numbers hits '0', the person on that side (either 
you or the monster) makes an Attack and both counters reset and begin 
counting down again. The speed at which the your counter counts down is 
constant, but you can make it count faster by pressing the left/right 
buttons alternately. The easiest way I've found to do this is to use two 
hands, one thumb to each button. The speed at which the monster counts 
varies by monster type (A is slowest, D is fastest). When either side is 
reduced to 0 HP, the battle ends.  

If you're not on level 100, you will go to a tic-tac-toe grid a little
rock will whiz around and land on one of the empty squares. If you get
three dots to line up in a row, you go to the next level. You should be
able to advance a level in not less than 3 battles won, and not more 
than 6 battles won.  Left alone, Boko advances one level about every 20 
minutes or so.  

When Boko gets reduced to 0 HP, he goes to sleep. While he sleeps, he 
will slowly recovers HP. After a while of wandering around, he will go
to sleep anyway (regardless of current HP). He eventually wakes up 
after some time (long after he has reached full HP). You can wake him up 
by pressing the 'Enter' button while he is sleeping. This doesn't work 
if he has 0 HP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reports and Preferences
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lastly, if you go to the map screen, you can view your status and change
settings by pressing left/right. In order of pressing 'Right' from the
map screen:

- Status screen: Displays current weapon, power level, map level, HP and 
  ID
- Item screen: Displays how many of each item you have
- Chocobo World Vs. Screen: Lets you challenge another Pocketstation
- Event Wait screen: Lets you set Event Wait on or off
- Mog screen (after level 25): Lets you set Mog to sleep or standby
- Move screen: Lets you set the movement rate

Since Chocobo World is amazing boring after a while, you can make it 
just play itself automatically. Set 'Event Wait' OFF by pressing the 
Down button on that screen. Boko will wander, sleep, fight, collect 
items and do random stuff without waiting to tell you.  

Normally, Boko just heads on forever in a straight line if you leave the
game running. Fix this by setting Movement rate on the move screen to a 
higher number. Boko will 'scan' for a number of pixels around him and 
turn toward an event dot within his sight range. The Movement rate tells 
him how many pixels to 'look'. So, setting it to '6', he will turn 
towards an event dot that is less than 6 squares away. Event dots 
disappear after he moves onto them and reappear somewhere else on the 
map. Sometimes, there will be no dots within 6 squares of Boko's line 
of travel and he will just keep going in the same direction forever. 
Check him occasionally if you leave him in Event Wait Off for long 
periods of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chocobo World Game Special Events
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Various special events will pause the game even if you have Event Wait 
Off and wait for you to come watch them. This will totally drain the 
battery in a few weeks (at most!) so don't leave the game displaying the 
'Event!' screen forever. The Level specified here is usually just the 
earliest level the event occurs, you may meet Koko any time after level 
20 for example. Only the Level 50 and Level 100 events are fixed to that 
level.

Level 20: Meet Koko (this occurs even if event wait is off) 
Koko bumps into Boko (or the other way around if event wait is off. Love 
at first sight, which makes sense since these two seem to be the only 
overgrown chickens in the game.

Level 25: Find Mog, initial settings (event wait can be off)
Koko and Mog jump up and down a few times. You can set Mog to either
Standby or Sleep. If he's on standby, and you are killed in battle, he 
will jump in and make one final attack for you. If that attack reduces 
the enemy to HP 0, you will survive the battle with 1 HP. If not, then 
you lose Mog and have to find him again.  

Level 50, event wait on: Rescue Koko (1st powerup)
or Level 50, event wait off: Fall into a pit 
It is IMPORTANT to have Event Wait on before you hit your first event
dot on level 50! If you have it off, Boko falls into a pit, misses the 
first powerup (meaning you may only get two!) and dies. Some people have 
reported not being able to get *ANY* powerups if they miss the first 
one, so if you miss yours, it is much better to use 'Do over' to reset 
your CW back to an old level. DO NOT USE THE 'HOME' command if you 
missed it, because it will update the 'Do over' command. 

Level 75: Hurry up!
The Cactuar guy and the Moomba tell you to hurry up and watch the 
fireworks.

Level 100: Koko abducted!
A demon monster grabs Koko and disappears. What a demon wants with a big 
chicken is beyond me. Still, you get to go rescue her.

Set MV to 1 to fight demon king
He has 99 HP, but is pretty slow & easy to beat.

Visit event dots with 'event wait' on (and possibly mog on standby as 
well) to get the 2nd and 3rd powerup (random, but won't appear without
Event wait on).  Maybe it's just me, but both times I got the 3rd 
powerup I had MV set to 3. I got both powerups within 20 straight
battles after fighting the demon king (without losing any battles).

Each Powerup improves Boko in FF8. When you summon Boko with the Gysahl 
Greens (available as an item in Chocobo World, or buyable from the 
ChocoBoy), he will appear, make an attack and leave. Depending on the 
number of powerups the attack strength varies:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Powerup Effects
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0 power-ups: ChocoFire (weak fire attack, about as strong as 'Fira')
  1 power-up : ChocoFlare (strong fire attack, 5000-9000 damage!)
  2 power-ups: ChocoMeteor (9999 damage!)
  3 power-ups: ChocoBuckle (INCOMING!  Usually 10,000-20,000 damage)

NOTE: That's not a typo, ChocoBuckle can do more than 10,000 damage in 
      a SINGLE ATTACK.  It is one of only a few attacks that can do
      that; the others are the Giant Cactuar's level 100 attack (does 
      exactly 10,000 damage), Eden (also can do 65,000 damage), Quistis'
      Shockwave Pulsar (sometimes does 10,000-20,000 damage). To see the 
      max HP damage, summon ChocoBuckle vs a weak enemy like the 
      Geezard.  

      Mostly it does 10,000-20,000 damage though.  To see Eden do 65,000 
      damage, summon her vs. a weak enemy after casting 'Meltdown' on 
      it.  Eden must be at level 100 and have all four SumMag +XX%s and 
      250 boost.

Q: Can this FAQ be used for European version/PC version/Japanese 
   version?
A: Well, it can be used but I would recommend you to pick the Japanese
   walkthrough that I have written for the Japanese version as due to 
   certain differences between the North Amercian Version and Japanese
   version.

Q: I have posted a hint for you, why you haven't added it?
A: It could be already found in the FAQ. Errr... please stop tell me 
   that you can draw Eden from Tiamat as it has been mentioned in the
   NA FAQs. This also applies to Quick Money Guide/plus some storylines
   related the one at Timber.

Sending a Question
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This problem has given me much problems from my previous FAQs. I have 
tried my best to answer when possible. Also don't ask me questions which
answers can be found in the FAQ. First of all, read the following before
sending an e-mail to Scott:

- Remember to add in "FF8" as your subject in the subject field of the 
  e-mail. I have gotten countless e-mails for FF8 and it will help me if 
  you classified it with the game titles.
- Next state your question as clearly as possible. If I find the e-mail
  quite hard to understand, I really don't know how to help it. 
- Make sure that words are not in CAPS lock [capital letters], which is
  quite rude, anywhere it doesn't matter to me. But try to avoid it 
  when necessary. Once I got really in a bad mood that I delete all
  e-mails that written in CAPS lock..
- If a question is too frequently asked, I will add it to the FAQ under
  frequently-asked section.
- Don't expect me to give answers which can be found in the FAQ. Or it
  will be useless for me to type it out so concisely.
- If you have problems in locating a shop/building, refer to the Maps
  section to settle out those problems.
- BTW, unlike other FAQ writers, I have only one motive and that's to
  help you guys out there by writting the FAQ as concise as possible. [
  in order to give the help that I could]. Well, the FAQ can be proved
  by judging the amount of e-mails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most Frequently Asked Questions [FAQs].
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- READ THIS BEFORE SENDING AN E-MAIL. Well, I do accept complaints and
  comments for my FAQs. I would prefer complaints as it allows me to 
  know what changes can be done for the FAQ. If you have a comments, 
  free to drop an e-mail. [it helps to urge me on!]

Q: Can I post the FAQ for your website?
A: Sure as long as the following steps are followed:
   - the disclaimer, including my name and format of the document is not
     altered.
   - No changes should not be made to the FAQ.
   - No HTMLizing of document, as this is same as editing the document. 
     You can't place banners on top of the FAQ. 
   - If you link to GameFAQs, don't link it directly to the FAQ, instead
     link it to the Final Fantasy VIII FAQs database at GameFAQs. 

Q: Where can I get the latest revisions of the FAQ?
A: At GameFAQs. If you want your site to be added to the addresses where
   this FAQ can be gotten, you need to seek permission from me. 

Q: Can you sent me the FAQ?
A: No. Otherwise, I would not have to post it to GameFAQs. Remember that
   this FAQ is a bit too huge to be posted via e-mail. Remember that you
   need to get the latest revisions yourself at GameFAQs. 
   (http://www.gamefaqs.com)

   I know that some guys out there have problems in access to Internet 
   due to personal reasons. But it can't be helped. Anyway, you can 
   always count on a friend to get it for you. I felt quite sorry for
   WebTV users as they can access a maximum of 170 Kbs. Don't worry, I
   will try my best to keep this file small. Or I may spilt the FAQ in
   separate FAQs.

Q: What other FAQs that you have written?
A: Quite a lot, you can check it out at my Contributor page anyway.

Q: Why you haven't answered my e-mail?
A: There perhaps may be a few reasons:
   - school [I still got tons of assignments/projects/tests]
   - the answer can be found in the FAQ [if you haven't received the 
     e-mail for two weeks]. I always check my e-mail during weekends/
     holidays, unless I am really busy for that week.
   - Other things may coped up.
   Note that if you can't contact me, feel free to contact other FAQ
   writers for the particular game. But I will be free most of the time
   during school breaks.
   - I may be busying playing the game to uncover more secrets.
