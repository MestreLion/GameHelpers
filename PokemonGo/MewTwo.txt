PC/FB: Top Defenders (Blissey, Chansey, Snorlax)
	- NORMAL type doubly-resists GHOST and is weak to FIGHTING, so FOCUS BLAST instead of SHADOW BALL
	- Against top defenders FB is not overkill 
	- PSYCHO CUT: maximize EPS for FB, its SE damage compensates lesser DPS than CONFUSION
	- Better dodgeability crucial to charge more 1-bar FB

PC/SB: Psychic Specialist (Mewtwo itself, Alakazam)
	- PSYCHIC type is weak to GHOST, so SHADOW BALL
	- PSYCHIC type resists PSYCHIC, so no PSYCHIC and fast move DPS not so relevant
	- PSYCHO CUT: maximize EPS for SB, its SE damage compensates lesser DPS than CONFUSION

C/SB: Generalist
	- CONFUSION highest neutral DPS
	- SHADOW BALL is 2-bar and highest neutral DPS

C/P: Fighting/Poison Specialist (Machamp, ?)
