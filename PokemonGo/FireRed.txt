Here is what a leveling up team could look like while trying to complete your playthrough.
Charizard, Lapras, Jolteon, Marowak, Kadabra, Snorlax.
Unless you can get 2 evee's through a trade, Pick either Vaporeon or Jolteon and get Lapras/Megaton as a substitute.

Best possible team you could try to get and what you should strive for in my humble opinion is.
Arcanine, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Marowak, Alakazam, and Snorlax.

Team Coverage
-------------
You don't need to cover every type. Some types, like steel and Dragon, are useless for attacking.
Steel hits Rock and Ice. Fighting hits Rock and Ice as well, along with Dark, Steel and Normal. Fighting > Steel.
Dragon hits Dragon. Ice hits Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground. Ice > Dragon

Best of each type
-----------------
Normal: Snorlax. Incredible stats and even better movepool. It'd be hard for him to faint even if you wanted him to.
Psychic: Alakazam if you can trade Kadabra for him, otherwise it's close between Kadabra and Mr. Mime. Both are very powerful special attackers, though.
Fighting: Hitmonlee for sure. Great speed, incredible attack, surprisingly good special defense.
Ghost: Not much choice here. Gengar. Gastly is very difficult to raise but the Shadow Ball TM makes everything worth it.
Dragon: Again, no choices here; Dragonite. I wouldn't recommend raising one though, because Dratini and Dragonair are pretty mediocre and take FOREVER to level. Not worth the time investment.
Flying: Not counting the legendary birds, Dodrio, hands down. Basically a way stronger version of Fearow. Drill peck is a win.
Poison: Muk has great offensive stats and a pretty good movepool. Pretty crappy type altogether, though. Just ask Team Rocket, lol.
Grass: Venusaur. Good overall stats and a very solid movepool including all three status powders.
Water: Close between Lapras and Blastoise. Blastoise has better defenses but Lapras has better typing and more HP and attacking powers. Lapras in my opinion, others would probably argue Blastoise's case.
Fire: Arcanine by FAR. He was originally meant to be a legendary, so his stats are way higher than any normally obtainable pokemon's stats should be, and he has access to some great moves, including Flamethrower and the superpowered version of Quick Attack, Extremespeed.
Ground: Dugtrio and Marowak are both good for different reasons. Dugtrio will pretty much always go first in battles, but doesn't hit that hard. Marowak is slower, but much stronger, and has a more diverse movepool. Your call.
Rock: Golem if you can trade for him, but otherwise, Rhydon is a very solid backup plan.
Ice: Lapras and Jynx are both vying for this position. I already chose Lapras, so we'll go with Jynx; great offensive stats and a wonderful movepool.
Electric: Jolteon by FAR. Outspeeds everything and does a lot of OHKOing even with Shock Wave, which is a TM you get after beating the first gym. Jolteon is easy to over-level, I know from experience; and it's a good problem to have.

Normal: Snorlax for sure, it's stats are insane. Hp: 160, Atk: 110 and Special defense: 110.
Psychic: Alakazam if you can trade, Kadabra if you can't.
Fighting: Hitmonlee is the strongest there with his 120 Atk and better rounded stats than Hitmonchan and Primape.
Ghost: Gengar or Haunter if you can't trade.
Dragon: Dragonite, incredibly rounded stats with a massive 134 in Atk. Very powerful if a bit grindy to level up.
Flying: Pure normal/flying, Dodrio. Aerodactyl is an interesting choice, but with 5 whopping weaknesses he isn't very viable.
Poison: Muk hands down. Has over 100 in Hp, Atk and special defense stats. Poison moves like Sludge and Sludge Bomb are physical attacks. So he is the perfect poison type to take advantage of those. Nidoking is a good second choice though.
Grass: Venusaur has a good rounded set of stats, with 100 in Special Attack which most grass moves utilize.
Water: Vaporeon hands down. With 130 in HP and 110 in special attack, there is no other water pokemon that has better stats than this guy. Blastoise and Lapras are subpar compared to Vaporeon.
Fire: Arcanine has the best stats by far, but he is very difficult to get in good shape. You have to raise a growlithe from an egg with the moves you want. Use fire stone from lvl 5 so you raise him up with maximum stat increases. Then TM whatever other you moves you want. Do all that and he is the king. Charizard however has a higher special attack rating and is still a very good 2nd choice.
Ground: Marowak by far, there is no competition. His speed stat is very bad, however he becomes a monster IF and only IF you have a -Thick Bone- equipped. Marowak has 80 in his Attack stat, which is nothing special. However with Thick Bone it doubles it. A whopping 160 freaking attack power. Insane.
Rock: Aerodactyl is the best Rock Pokemon oddly enough. Rhydon has great stats but a whopping 6 weaknesses with 2 of them being x4. Aerodactyl has better overall stats but less attack power. But with 5 weaknesses Rock type isn't recommended.
Ice: Lapras. There is literally only 3 ice type Pokemon that's not legendary. I would just recommend picking Vaporeon instead.
Electric: Jolteon is by far the strongest non legendary eletric type. Magneton has 10 more in special attack but has weaker stats in everything else. Along with 2 more weaknesses and a x4.

Paras(egg move)
Farfetch'd(Lv.46)
Cubone(Lv.33)
Marowak(Lv.39)
Scyther(Lv.16)
Pinsir(egg move)


=======================================
HM Slaves
=======================================

NidoKing/NidoQueen
-Strength
-Cut
-Rocksmash
-Dig/Surf---whichever one you need, but considering surf is actually a good move, one of your water Pokemon will probably have it.

Most Water and Grass types are good choices, namely Gyarados and Tropius. If you can get one, Smeargle can Sketch any move, and you can teach any HM to Mew.

Krabby
Gyarados

Psyduck can learn Surf, Strength, Flash, Rock Smash and Waterfall
Cut+Flash+Rock Smash: Paras
DRAGONITE can learn all except Flash.


=======================================
TMs
=======================================

water pulse - squirtle or poliwhirl. but only till you get surf.
dig - crap, don't bother. only useful in third gym.
rock tomb - decent, but the types that could use it usually learn it anyway
bullet seed - too weak
roar - the 'run' button has unlimited uses.
secret power - up to you
attract - don't bother
thief - use the snatch TM instead. use it on meowth and fish for mushrooms from paras at mt moon
