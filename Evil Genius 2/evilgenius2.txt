Stats
=====
- Meal Tables/Beds vs specialized stat-recover items (Re-Education Chair, Infirmary "Pods", Coffee TV-EG)
	- Tables/Beds recover stats only if non-critical (>~20?)
	- Specialized items needed for critical condition
	- Witinessing Genius executing a Minion also recover 100% of all stats

Stat Drains
-----------
Smarts (so only leave to eat):
- Guard Post
- Skill items at Casino
- Research
- Train

Morale (so only leave to sleep)
- Guard Table
- Resolve items at Casino
- See Body Bag
- Interrogate Prisioner
- Salary not paid

Smarts and Morale (usually smarts much faster than Morale):
- Security Table
- Generate Intel at Control Room


Casino
======
- Per pass through the casino, no agent will use the same kind of casino furniture twice
- Each investigator has about a 50% chance to ignore a piece of casino furniture when he gets within its aggro radius.

Security Cameras
================
- Spotting Power basically depends on manning minion class and its max smarts (50, 75, 100).
- Depends solely on the best manning minion. So 1 Mercenary + X Workers = 8 Spotting Power anyway.
- Max Spotting is 10 (Hitman/MA with 100 smarts)
- Having more cameras than your security tables can support DOES NOT DISABLE THE CAMERAS, they only take a penalty on your Spotting power.
- Lowering Agent's Smarts lower their disguise "power", so lower Spotting Power needed

Staff
=====
- Sattelite Links don't need to be manned

Schemes
========
- Heat Reduction schemes with Intel does NOT lure Super-Agents!

Trap Combos
===========
- Frozen + (fan?) + Shark Tank
- Frozen + (fan?) + Pinball
- Giant Fan + Shark Tank
- Giant Fan + Laser Wall + Shark Tank
- Giant Fan + Gas (blow gas to target)
- Giant Fan + Box Glove
- Giant Fan + Flamethrower
- Box Glove + Bees
- 3-Pinball bounce
- J.Steele _killed_ by Shark

Henchmen
================
- Sir Daniel requires all Super Agents to be alive!
	Carrion Flower (first mission)
- Always keep 1 Henchmen slot available (ie, have at most 4 Henchmen at a time), so all side-stories can appear
- Full Metal Jackie will appear very late in the game and only if you have a slot free
- Jubei:
	Meditation Stone
- Eli Barracuda Jr.
	Statue of Liberty's Torch
- Clara
	Terracotta Army
	Arabian Jars (1st mission)
	Carl and Clara are mutually exclusive: choose Clara, as Carl requires Loot Item

Super Agents
============
- Keep all alive until recruit Sir Daniel
- Symmetry
	Arabian Jars (1st mission)
	Let her succeed for Achievement
- Blue Saint
	Defeat with Jubei
- Atomic Olga
	Sword in the Stone
	Broken Time Machine
	Set her on fire for Achievement

 many side stories can get locked off if you progress too far with the main objectives, and can have non-intuitive methods for unlocking them. It's probably safer to assume most loot side stories will be locked off if you progress to the next main objective that unlocks the next batch of side stories.

A couple notes. Clara Jones, Jubei, and Eli are required for this achievement, so make sure you capture them, not kill them. Jubei is a good choice for the initial "freebie" henchman. Clara Jones and Carl Caffard are exclusive, as recruiting Clara Jones requires you to deal with Carl Caffard, so don't do Carl's side stories. No other henchmen are required, and only Agent X and Wrecking Bola need to be defeated before moving past chapter 14, which is the point of no return for the main objectives.

Edit: As Darth Hawk CZ pointed out, it is best to do this achievement with Zalika, so you can also obtain:
Evil Genius 2: World Domination
Technical Marvels
The Technical Marvels achievement in Evil Genius 2: World Domination worth 146 pointsAs Zalika, steal an extinct creature, one that is yet to hatch, and a treasure from another world.


Edit 2: This achievement should unlock when the final required side story is completed. Loot does not need to placed in your base, and nor should it matter if loot gets stolen by Symmetry or Rogue agents. You can always check completed side stories to ensure you've obtained every loot item in each batch.

Edit 3: I've continued adding in edits based on comments. I can assure you I completed the achievement as I originally wrote it, but just in case, I've been added in the reported requirements, as it's better safe than sorry. I'll repeat it here, one last time: Do this achievement slowly and methodically, as the unlock conditions are tricky, and missions will, repeat, WILL, disappear if you move the main story too quickly.
