========================================================================
      I’m sorry. Promise, hope to die, stick a poodle in my eye...
========================================================================

I hope you can forgive my unforgivable incompetence with this guide. 
(e.g. sloppy design, too many tiny updates, lack of an update for half a 
year...) This was the first guide I had ever written after all. The true 
is, I got really bored with Majora’s Mask after I had beaten it the 
first time, so going through it for a second run in such a short time 
span really wasn’t my favorite thing to do. But, I’m back, and here to 
complete this guide. Hopefully in the process, I’ll be making it the 
best one on GameFAQs! (shoot for the stars kiddies, and at least you’ll 
hit the moon.) And finding methods of speeding up the writing process 
will also help greatly... So enjoy the total reformatting of this guide!
For inspiration I looked at marshmallow’s Ocarina of Time FAQ. Very 
nicely laid out I might add.

-=(Current: Version 2.0)=-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday, September 29, 2001 - (Version 2.1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three days later, and lot’s more walkthrough is done -- up to the place 
where you need to access the Beneath the Well area. Next update will 
have the walkthrough going up to the start of Stone Tower Temple. And 
that’s coming soon. Ah... I can actually see the END of this project 
finally after so long...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday, September 26, 2001 - (Version 2.0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh...my...aching...hands... It one 2½ hour FAQ-writing binge I have 
completely finished off walkthrough for Great Bay Temple. Excuse me as I 
go do this thing called “eating”...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday, September 23, 2001 - (Version 1.9)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had some free time, so I decided to update this guide. It WILL be 
finished someday... I promise you that. Walkthrough for getting the 
third guardian mask up too the Great Bay Temple is finished! Temple 
walkthrough next update and there’s no grammatical errors either. :P

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday, August 27, 2001 - (Version 1.8)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

School has started up again for me, so that’s like a giant dagger in my 
side causing my spleen to rupture. Hopefully, you get the picture... 
This guide along with my others will be updated less frequently. The 
reorganization of the entire guide is 80% complete. Many Heart Piece 
locations have been added and some other sections started up. Keep in 
mind this document is still being worked on and most optional sections 
have not been started. I have added in a more comprehensive FAQ section, 
which should keep my email to a minimum... Also some walkthrough for 
getting the Third Guardian Mask has been written but has some bad 
grammatical errors and typos. But that shouldn’t hurt your pretty little 
eyes right? :P

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, August 14, 2001 - (Version 1.7)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When’s the last time I actually updated this guide? Seems like forever. 
Well, here it is folks. I completely finished all of “Getting Back 
Epona” in the walkthrough. That was a LOT of typing, almost too much, so 
I hope you enjoy it fully... I learned a new cool technique to tape 
record as you’re playing, so no more paper notes ever again for me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday, December 11, 2000 - (Version 1.6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a long day, and many hours of work, I have finally finished the
complete Snowhead Temple walkthrough! I added in a Prelude to the
“Starting Out” section. Along with that, many errors were fixed and a
few enemy listings added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday, December 4, 2000 - (Version 1.5)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hope all of you are happy, I have completed the “Trekking to Snowhead”
section, and the first half of the walkthrough of Snowhead Temple!
Expect another large update soon, as I am not so side-tracked with
Banjo-Tooie. The fairies for Snowhead Temple will also be coming as well
with a map guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday, November 27, 2000 - (Version 1.4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have gotten a little side-tracked playing Banjo-Tooie, =) so I have
not gotten a chance to work on the Snowhead Temple walkthrough. I did
however start the “Thread Walkthrough,” inspired by the “Bare-Boned
Walkthrough” by fellow GameFAQs writer, Dallas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday, November 23, 2000 - (Version 1.3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I am thankful that I am finally almost done
with the “Second Guardian Mask” asterisk section. I have completed about
half of the “Trekking to Snowhead” section, and the map showing the
layout of Snowhead Temple. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday, November 18, 2000 - (Version 1.2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have completed the “Lens of Truth Sees a Goron Ghost” section of the
walkthrough. Along with that, the “Sing the Crying Baby to Sleep” is
also completely done. I also finally started up advice in the “So, That
Vulture Stole Your Valuable Item(s)?” section. Many people have
complained about that darned Takkuri at the entrance to Milk Road. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday, November 15, 2000 - (Version 1.1) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have finished up the first three dash-sections on the asterisk-section
“Second Guardian Mask.” On the fourth section, it is now three fourths
complete. I also added in how to get the Great Fairy Mask in the “Fairy
Frenzy” section. Another update is coming soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday, November 11, 2000 - (Version 1.0) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update is long over-do. But the reason for the time frame is
instead of doing two smaller updates, I wanted to do one large one. And
here it is. I added a few masks and songs to there sections. And most
importantly, I completed the entire walkthrough for Woodfall Temple.
Including instructions to the fairy locations with a locator map in the
“Fairy Frenzy” section.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday, November 5, 2000 - (Version 0.9)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I finished up all of “On Your Way to Woodfall” and… 3 fourths of The
“Woodfall Temple” section! The other fourth shall be finished tomorrow
along with the fairy locations for the temple. I have all the research
done, I just need to type it up. I also started the “FAQ Section” and
the “Stupid, Idiotic Email I Get” section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday, November 2, 2000 - (Version 0.8)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I finally typed all of “Monkey Trouble in Deku Palace.” That was the
longest section yet. I also did the research for the “On Your Way to
Woodfall” section. That shall be done tomorrow. Along with the first
half of the “Woodfall Temple” section. Also started up the “Tracking
Down the 6 Bottles” and the “So, That Vulture Stole Your Valuable
Item(s)?” sections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Wednesday, November 1, 2000 - (Version 0.7)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today was a looooooooooong day. I did a lot of further research for the
walkthrough on getting the first guardian mask. I typed up all of the
section “Adventures With Koume and Kotake in Southern Swamp” and about
half of the “Monkey Trouble in Deku Palace” section. The other half will
be finished tomorrow and walkthrough on Woodfall Temple will finally
start to happen!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, October 31, 2000 - (Version 0.6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy Halloween everyone! And yes, like I promised, the large update
came today! I wrote half of the “First Guardian Mask” section. Which
includes “Transforming Back Into Your Normal Self,” “Leaving Clock Town
and Heading South,” and part of “Adventures With Koume and Kotake in
Southern Swamp.” I also added more information in the enemies section,
and fixed some more tiny errors. Expect it finished up to the “Second
Guardian Mask” section tomorrow, since I have a half-day in school.
Besides, Majora’s Mask just came out 5 days ago. :P

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Monday, October 30, 2000 - (Version 0.5)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well today was a small update, I was quite tired today, sorry! Anyway, I
added more to enemies and masks. I also fixed a few small errors in 
the walkthrough. The songs section is started up as well. I know on
Friday I said to expect a large update Saturday, however, it is coming
tomorrow! Just hold out a little longer... Anything worth doing is worth
doing right. =)

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Friday, October 25, 2000 - (Version 0.4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I finished typing up the “Astral Observatory and the Moon Tear” section,
and completed the “Give Skull Kid a Taste of His Own Mischief.” I am
continuing to work on this and expect another large update tomorrow. My
hands hurt! =) “How to Use This Document on Your Website” is under
construction, expect it to be done soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Thursday, October 26, 2000 - (Version 0.3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the third release, I am about 15% done making this walkthrough.
Yea! Majora’s Mask officially came out today! Wow... this walkthrough is 
getting very long already. I typed up “Deku Link Earns Some Magic Skill”
and “Having Some fun With the Bombers Crew.” I polished up the “Starting
Out” section. All the grammatical errors should be out of it, and the
detail to my quality level. The first half of the Astral Observatory
section is done, don’t worry I’ll make a better title for that section.
This is one large update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday, October 25, 2000 - (Version 0.2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The “Controls” and “Basics of the Game” section have been completed. I
typed up the “Starting Out” part on the walkthrough, expect that to be
further polished. I also have added in “Comments to Consider Before you
Start.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Monday, October 23, 2000 - (Version NEW!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release, I am approximately 5% completed with it. I
designed have the layout for the document, as well as typing up the
Prologue and Legal Information.

The Proper Way to Display This Guide on Your Site
========================================================================


This FAQ that you are currently reading may ONLY appear on: 

- GameFAQs <www.gamefaqs.com> 


The reason being, is that I DIRECTLY send my FAQs there. Not only that, 
but the webmaster CJayC does a good job of getting the FAQs up and 
keeping them updated. Along with, rejecting crappy work from the site 
and checking for plagiarists constantly.


HOWEVER, if you want to use my guide, but are not that one site listed 
above, here’s exactly what you do.

**** WEBMASTERS PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What NOT to do:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<<<<< DO NOT >>>>>>
...copy and paste this FAQ on your website. This obviously, does not 
apply to www.gamefaqs.com, like I said before.

<<<<<< DO NOT >>>>>> 
...link this FAQ directly to your webpage. Again, this does not apply to 
GameFAQs. In other words, DON’T link to anything that is the actual text 
guide or has a “.txt” or “.doc” at the end of the URL. I repeat, NOTHING 
that ends with a “.txt” or “.doc” Don’t make me repeat that a third 
time. Just don’t, because not only does it aggravate me, but it also 
violates the GameFAQs legal section that can be found here:

http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/legal/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE DO:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

...link to the GameFAQs Majora’s Mask page. In other words, link to the 
page on GameFAQs where it shows a COMPLETE list of ALL the guides for 
this game. That way, not only do you get my guide, but access to other 
peoples as well. No muss, no fuss. Since the webmaster of GameFAQs CJayC 
allows that, you DON’T even have to ask permission to do it either. It 
will probably take you thirty seconds max, then you never have to worry 
about any of the guides updating. You could name the link something like 
“GameFAQs guides about Zelda: Majora’s Mask.”

This is the first walkthrough I have ever written for a video game, and
from the look of it, it’s insanely long! The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s
Mask may at first appear to be a simple side quest to the Ocarina of
Time, but it is indeed worth commending as a self-supporting game. The
groundhogs’ day style of playing the same 3 days repeatedly might at
first be thought of as repetitive, but that is hardly the case, and only
serves to increase the challenge of an already difficult game. I put in
an enormous amount of time and effort into this project. I really hope
that this is a quality work that will answer most of your questions
about this video game masterpiece. This guide will hopefully insult your
intelligence, because I have included even the most basic concepts and
principles of the game in it. 

Again, if you have any additions, questions, comments, ect. feel free to

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is REQUIRED to play this 
video game. Without it, you might as well use Majora’s Mask for a hockey 
puck. Well, maybe a doorstop... REQUIRED, not optional? OK? It must be 
IN your Nintendo 64 before the game even works. There was a lot of 
confusion over this when Majora’s Mask was first released. People were 
thinking the Expansion Pak was used like it was in Perfect Dark -- the 
game would still work, just the pak gave you full access to the game. 
Not the case here. You must have the Expansion Pak to play Majora’s 
Mask. Period. 

NOTE #2: Since this document cannot be put into HTML format and is 
obviously very long, I strongly recommend that you highlight text you 
are reading. That way, if you need to skip to another section for more 
detailed instruction, you can easily get back to where you were 
previously at. Another way to easily scan this document is (Ctrl + F). 
When the table comes up, type in a specific term from the Table of 
Contents and off you go. Simple I hope. 

NOTE #3: If you are playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask for the 
first time, please, do not read the walkthrough in depth! It contains 
major spoilers on all aspects of the game. Most certainly you can take a
peek... But, I recommend that only if you have been stuck on something 
in the game for a good while and need a little help. It would be a shame 
if you spoiled this game for yourself. Then I’d have to beat you with a 
stick, and that’s bad...

The beginning of the Majora’s Mask saga begins roughly two months after 
our young adventurer Link had saved Hyrule from the clutches of the evil 
Ganondorf in the previous game, Ocarina of Time. Link is on a quest to 
find Navi the fairy, his partner whom departed right after he sealed 
away the Master Sword in the Temple of Time. 

In trying to find Navi, Link is off searching a desolate patch of forest 
while riding his horse Epona, when he bumps into the Skull Kid who wears 
the Mask of Majora. Skull Kid then causes much chaos -- stealing Link’s 
horse, ocarina, and turning Link into a Deku Scrub and transporting him 
to the world of Termina. Termina is a place doomed in just three days 
from an impact of the plummeting moon. Try to stop the moon and get back 
home in one piece! If you can, that is...

  5.   G A M E   C O N T R O L S


========================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal Link
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Description - Link, our main hero in his true form. 

Analog Joystick - This is the means of movement for Link. Push in a
direction with hard pressure for him to run that way, and soft pressure
for him to just walk along slowly.

B Button - This button allows Link to attack with his sword. Press this
button while steering with the analog joystick to swim in water. Hold it
down and release for a 360 degree spinning slash attack. Very useful,
but requires some magic to use.

A Button - This will execute an action, or confirm something. It allows
Link to open a door, scroll text when speaking to a person, ect. Combine
pushing  the A Button with pressing on the analog joystick to execute a
roll in that direction. You may also dive into the water using this
combination of controls. Add pressing the A Button with the Z Button and
you can execute a potent overhead leaping attack.

R Button - This allows you to use your shield to protect Link. Hold down
and the R Button and use the analog joystick to point which way the
shield should face.

Z Button - If no enemy is near Link, this allows him to look directly
forward. When enemies happen to be near and are in range, this signals
his Fairy to fly over and lock-on to them as a target. This is very
useful for battles, as that way Link will always be looking towards them
no matter which way they happen to move.

Camera Up Button - Press this button to move the camera into first
person mode allowing you to look around closely at your surroundings.

Camera Left, Camera Down, and Camera Right Buttons - You may set an item
from the selection screen to use on each of these buttons. 

Direction Pad - This is not used in this game.

L Button - Along with the Directional Pad, this button is not used.

Abilities that are unique to the Human Link is that he may dive
underwater and wear his multitude of masks. Plus, the fact that you can
only exit Clock Town in human form. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deku Scrub Link
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Description - Having a very short height, Deku Scrub Link has a
contrasting large round head. His limbs are extremely short, piercing
red eyes and a snout dot his face. He is wearing the same Kokirish
clothing as Link, although the length of his hat has increased.

Analog Joystick - This is the means of movement for Deku Scrub Link.
Push in a direction with hard pressure for him to scamper that way, and
soft pressure for him to just creep along.

B button - Pressing this button allows Deku Scrub Link to shoot bubbles
from his snout. Press B the first time to go into the aiming screen,
press it again to fire the Bubble Blast. Hold and release the B button
to shoot a larger bubble. -[This move must be earned, see the
walkthrough on the means of getting it.]-

A Button - If you have Deku Scrub Link stand upon a Deku flower and
press and hold A, he will bury himself in it. Wait until puffs of pollen
shoot out, then release the A button for him to soar into flight.
Pressing the B button in midair with allow him to drop the very useful
Deku Nut bombs. When not near a flower, using the A button will execute
a whirling attack causing him to spin his long hat around.

R Button - Using this button allows Deku Scrub Link to curl up into a
little ball. This in effect acts as his shielding.

Z Button - If no enemy is near Deku Scrub Link, this allows him to look
directly forward. When enemies happen to be near and are in range, this
signals his Fairy to fly over and lock-on to them as a target. This is
very useful for battles, as that way Deku Scrub Link will always be
looking towards them no matter which way they happen to move.

Camera Up Button - Press this button to move the camera into first
person mode allowing you to look around closely at your surroundings.

Camera Left, Camera Down, and Camera Right Buttons - You may set an item
from the selection screen to use on each of these buttons. 

Direction Pad - This is not used in this game.

L Button - Along with the Directional Pad, this button is not used

Abilities that are unique to the Deku Scrub Link is shooting bubbles
from his snout. He can also soar into flight using Deku Flowers and go 5
skips across the surface of water. Beware however, even though he can
skip on the water for limited periods of time, he can not swim.

contact with in some way to be able to beat the game. This of course is 
not a full list, I’d be insane to type in descriptions for every 
possible character you come across in your adventure. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Link  (Kokiri boy hero)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don’t know who Link is, pardon me as I run very, very, far away 
from you. This little Kokiri (Kokiri is the forest race from Ocarina of 
Time) elf wears clothes of green and is the main character of the game, 
and the one that you play as. A peculiar trait in this game is that Link 
can transform into multiple forms with magical masks. But, let’s not get 
ahead of ourselves yet...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skull Kid  (Thingy-I-can’t-identify)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skull kid... is an imp, I guess. Or maybe a gnome? He wear’s clothes 
that only a scarecrow would love. Whatever the case may be, this is the 
guy that stole the Majora’s Mask from the Happy Mask Salesman (Guess 
he’s not so happy anymore?) and your beloved Epona the horse. He is 
causing total chaos in the world of Termina by having the moon plummet 
from the sky, trying to kill everything. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tatl and Tael  (Fairy siblings)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These two fairies have become partners with Skull Kid in his crime 
spree. Tatl –- the white female fairy with a yellow halo, and Tael -- 
her brother who is purple with a blue halo. Fortunately for you, Tatl 
accidentally gets left behind when Skull Kid flees after stealing your 
horse, ending up helping you as a partner.    

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy Mask Salesman  (Guy with a large backpack)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This wandering man wears a gigantic backpack filled with all types of 
masks. (Check out that Mario mask too) This man was just wandering along 
when Skull Kid knocked him out and stole his most valuable mask -- the 
Mask of Majora. Skull Kid possessing it is very dangerous, so he wants 
you, Link, to get it back for him. He will of course reward you greatly 
for your efforts... but fear his temper. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epona (The stallion)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the same trusty horse Link had in his previous adventure, the 
Ocarina of Time. The horse is very graceful, sporting a brown coat and 
white main. To bad for you that Epona has been stolen in this game. 
Although you can ride her again once she’s won back...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Brown Owl  (An owl, stupid)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, a big shocker, this guy is an owl. Making a return appearance from 
the Ocarina of Time, he’s supposedly the reincarnation of an ancient 
sage says a gossip stone. Link will encounter this brown owl from time 
to time, giving him valuable help in his quest. You can also learn the 
Song of Soaring from the owl –- a song which allows you to warp to any 
owl statue throughout the land. More of that in the game basics.


========================================================================
Gameplay Basics
========================================================================


<Time is of the Essence...>

The entire game of Majora’s Mask is played around a time system. Link
has a duration of three days to get as many objectives completed before
the moon crashes and destroys everything in the island of Termina.
Before the lunar crash, travel back to the first day using the Ocarina
of Time and continue to relive the three days to continue to accomplish
more. Keeping a eye on the time should be easy, there is time counter
located on the playing screen. Three days equals 72 total hours, and one
minute of real time is equivalent to one hour of game time. This means
you have 72 minute intervals to get all you can done. Since some items
are lost when you travel in time, so make sure to deposit your
collection of rupees in the bank in West Clock Town.

<Saving Your Game and Warp Points>

Owl statues you may find in your journeys serve a dual purpose. Not only
do they save your game, but they also allow you to warp to the spot in
which you found them. To activate, you need only to strike the Owl
statue with your sword. Or as the statue itself is inscribed “Ye who
hold the sacred sword leave proof of our encounter.” Strike it again
anytime you wish to save your game. Playing the Song of Soaring on your
Ocarina and selecting a statue will allow you to travel to it. Owl
statues can be found in almost every area of the game, keep your eyes
open and look for them in any new places you come across in your
travels. The second form of saving is very simple, use your ocarina to
play the Song of Time. It will ask you if you wish to warp to the dawn
of the first day, and save your game.

<Those Icons... What do They Mean?>

Good understanding of the game screen is essential to playing well. When
playing, you will notice several meters and icons dotted around. In the
upper-left hand corner, the hearts symbolize how much life energy you
have left. If you happen to have earned it, a horizontally placed green
magic meter is located under the hearts. This displays how much magic
power you have left to use. The lower-left hand corner contains a tiny
gem and a counter recording how many rupees acquired thus far. Located
Directly at the bottom of the screen is a time clock. This shows the day
number on the green icon, current time on the lines, and whether its
night or daytime by the sun or moon symbol. Next to the time clock is a
map of the current area you are in. The yellow area is you, and it
points the direction you are traveling. The red arrow shows where  you
just came from. In Clock Town, a Map is only shown if you have purchased
one from the Map Dealer. The upper-right hand corner has the items you
have set to use on the yellow camera buttons for usage. Next to that, is
the icons of the blue A-button and green B-button. The A-button shows
the action displayed on it. Like “Drop,” “Grab,” or “Climb.” And the
green B-button shows the sword that your using on it, or a action that
can be done, just like the A button.

<Hunting Down Masks>

Unlike in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, masks and the Happy Mask
Trader play a key role in this game. Each mask gives Link a new skill or
ability. There are 24 total masks in the game track down. Four of the
masks change and transform Link into another form, while the other 20
empower abilities he has. Not all of them are required to complete the
game, but I would strongly consider earning as many of them as possible.

<The Sound of Music>

This time around, Link can learn many new tunes to play on a variety of
instruments. As a lowly Deku Scrub, he can use his Deku Pipes, while
Goron Link carries a nice set of  gourd drums. Remember though, the
Ocarina is your friend. Learning a tune may sometimes give Link tools to
manipulate time itself. Some songs make the minute shorter, while others
increase its length. When you do learn a song, you now have it forever
and can play it whenever you like. Forgetting how to play a song once
you have received it is not a problem. Simply pause your game and look
at the Game Status screen. From there, find the proper tune and the
correct buttons to press will be displayed. 

<Fairy Frenzy!>

In every temple you come across, there are 15 hidden fairies to find.
While it is not mandatory to collect them, try to track down as many of
them as possible because you will be greatly rewarded for your efforts,
such as increased magic meter. These magical fairies can be hiding
anywhere. Places like ceramic pots, within enemies, and treasure chests
are good places to start looking. The fairies don the color of either
yellow, green, blue, or pink depending upon the temple your currently
in hunting for them. When you locate all 15 fairies, simply return them
to the Great Fairy Fountain. One is conveniently located nearby every
temple. To have the location of every fairy, simply look below in the
“Temple Fairy Locations” section.

                      waged across time, he embarked
                        on a journey. A secret and
                            personal journey...

                         A journey in search of a
                      beloved and invaluable friend...

                          A friend whom he parted
                     ways when he finally fulfilled his
                     heroic destiny and took his place
                              among legends...

THINGS TO FIND: 10 Deku Nuts, at least 5 Rupees


Time to set off on your grand adventure, or misfortune you could say. As 
you start your game, a cinema scene starts to play... Link is trotting 
along in the Lost Woods on the back of his horse Epona. The forest is 
silent and misty. As Epona pauses to rest for a moment, out of now 
where, the two Fairies Tatl and Tael fly out and startle her. Link is 
knocked off the back of the pony and rendered unconscious. Seconds 
later, Skull Kid materializes next to a nearby tree. He congratulates 
his pint-sized pals for a job well done. 

Slinking over to Link, he starts rummaging through his pockets and comes 
across the Ocarina of Time. Skull Kid plays a few random notes on the 
instrument and Link awakens in a panic. Even though it is to late, Skull 
Kid tries to play dumb and hides the Ocarina behind his back. Sensing 
he’s already caught, he jumps on the back of Epona with Ocarina in hand 
and starts to ride off. In the nick of time, Link leaps forward and 
grabs a hold of Skull Kid’s ankle. Both of the them ride along but Link 
soon looses his grip and is dropped off in a small forest grove.
 
You now gain control of Link. Slash the two patches of scrubs ahead and 
collect at least 5 rupees. The 5 rupees are for buying a map in the up 
coming town. Now, head north and run through the knot hole. Continue 
running till you reach the group of tree stumps. Jump along the tops of 
them till you reach the ledge. Trot into the dark cavern.
 
A second cinema scene now begins. Link is shown walking, right of the 
edge of a rock face! He plummets down through the inky darkness. Strange 
multitudes of figures float around, Link lands on the top of a flower. 
Skull Kid is shown hovering a few feet away, his fairy pals on each side 
of him. He decides he wishes to have a little fun with you. Using the 
evil powers of the mask he is wearing, magic waves of energy fly at you. 
A dream sequence of dancing giant Deku Scrubs ensues in your mind. 
Fading away... you realize, you have now been transformed into a Deku 
Scrub! 

Skull Kid cackles at the predicament he’s just caused. With your ocarina 
and horse hidden away, and you in your present state, he floats back 
through the door behind him and seals it shut. Skull Kid and Tael dash 
away, but leave the white fairy Tatl behind with you. She decides that 
Skull Kid is no good and she should help you, becoming your fairy for 
this adventure. 

You can now control Deku Scrub Link. Run over and open the door. Walk 
through and run down through the hallway till the reach the very end. 
You should be standing on a ledge with a Deku Flower. Jump on top of it 
and hold down the A button. Wait till the puff of pollen shoots out the 
top then release the button. Use the Flowercopters in your hands and 
glide over to the platform in front of you. Run over and open the wooden 
door. You enter in and should be a another platform with another Deku 
Flower. Use the flower and glide over the pit to the first stone pillar. 
Repeat and glide over to the next pillar with the large treasure chest 
on it. Open it up and to receive 10 Deku Nuts. 

Now, use the Deku Flower on this platform and glide to the right of the 
treasure chest. Where your currently at, use the flower glide the 
maximum distance possible to the thin platform in the opposite direction 
of the treasure chest. Don’t bother talking to the Deku Scrub here. Jump 
over the pit and run out the cavern exit. Keep running through this 
spiraling hallway and open the metallic door.

THINGS TO FIND: Happy Mask Trader


It will now shut tightly and lock behind you. Your now in the basement 
of the Clock Tower. Travel up the ramp just left of the spinning 
turbine. Keep following up the ramps till you reach the top. Walk over 
to the wooden exit doors. 

When your about to open it, a backpack-bearing man calls your attention. 
You turn around to face him. He is the Happy-Mask Trader and admits he 
was following you. Engaging in a conversation, he states that “If you 
can get back that precious item stolen from you, I will return you to 
normal.” All he asks is that you return a precious mask to him, the one 
stolen by Skull Kid. But, he must leave when his time is up, in only 
three days. Finish up your conversation and head out the wooden doors to 
start your hunt for the Ocarina of Time...

THINGS TO FIND: Clock Town Map, Stray Fairy, Deku Bubble Shooter, Code 
into the Astral Observatory


After exiting out the door, you have now entered into Clock Town. You 
new fairy friend Tatl informs you that the Great Fairy watches over 
everything and should know about Skull Kid. Begin by walking forward and 
to the right. Run and turn right again just before the canal and go up 
the wooden ramp and past a small owl statue. Trot down to the end and go 
up the another ramp. Run forward and out the exit to your left. Entering 
in, your view will open up to a small park area, North Clock Town. You 
should see a small kid trying to shoot a balloon with a blowgun. Ignore 
him for now and walk past. Up ahead, you should see a short man wearing 
green jumpsuit and clutching a brown paper in his hand. Go over and talk 
to him. This is Tinkle, the Map Salesman for Clock Town. 

He claims that he is a Fairy Boy, but that a fairy has still not come to 
be his own even at age 35. Whatever the case may be, he befriends you 
because you have a fairy yourself and sells you a map for the low price 
of 5 rupees. Buy it. This will greatly help you navigate around town. 

Once you have it, run over to the ramp you see in the left corner. Go up 
both the ramps and enter into the Great Fairy Fountain. When you enter, 
walk forward till you reach the pool of water. You should see a swarm of 
tiny fairies flying around. Walk into the middle of the huddled mass. 
The Great Fairy will begin speaking to you and say that she was foolish 
and trusted that evil prankster Skull Kid. Who then shattered her into 
pieces making her into the current state. She asks you to recover the 
one missing piece, the Stray Fairy that got loose. Finish speaking with 
her and exit out of the Great Fairy Fountain. 

During the daytime, the Stray Fairy will be floating over the creek in 
the Laundry Pool area. At night, it will be flying around in East Clock 
Town near the Deku Flower. Check the Clock Town map and legend above, 
then map icon on your screen to guide you to the appropriate place(s). 
After you have nabbed the single Stray Fairy, return back to the Great 
Fairy Fountain.

Walk up to the water, the stray fairy will fly out and into the mass. 
The fairies will agglomerate into a sphere of white light, and the 
screen with flash. The task complete, the Great Fairy will scream up out 
of the water and float in the air, good as new. “Tatl, and you, young 
one of the altered shape... Thank you returning my broken and shattered 
body to normal.” She then rewards you with the gift of using magic and 
the ability to shoot Bubbles from your snout. The green Magic Meter will 
now appear under you Heart Gauge. Good job! 

After your Fairy hunting ordeal is over, walk back outside. Remember 
that kid attempting to shoot the balloon with his blowgun? Well, go down 
the ramps and walk over to where he’s standing. Aim up at the balloon 
with the tacky icon of Majora’s Mask on it. Strike it with a large 
bubble, it with pop in a explosion of light. Talk to the kid now. He 
turns out to be Jim, the leader of The Bomber Crew. He is quite 
impressed with your work, and asks if you would like to join there club 
and gain access to there hang-out, Astral Observatory. However, there is 
a test of skill you must pass to get in. Take up his offer on it. Jim 
will ask you to play Hide-N-Seek with them.
 
Five Bomber children will be hidden around Clock Town. To find the 
children, look in these locations: two are on the rooftops in East Clock 
Town. One in is the market square in West Clock Town. Two are right 
where you start out, North Clock Town. You starting place is the balloon 
location. Some of them can be pretty tricky. When you get near them, 
they will scurry about in a frantic pace. To “find” the person, simply 
tag him. I recommend cornering them against a wall so there easier to 
catch. The two children in East Clock Town are the hardest to catch, 
because both of them our located on rooftops. The one on the east side 
might try to hide under a crate. To gain access to the child on the west 
side of East Clock Town, use the Deku Flower in the alcove of the 
buildings. One you have tagged all the children, the screen will fade 
out in white light. 

It fades back in with all five of the Bomber Crew standing in a line and 
Jim speaking to you. The members detest you joining there club, “No way! 
No Scrubs!” they say. However, Jim still keeps half the bargain and 
teaches you the code to access Astral Observatory. 

If a guide gives you a number for the code, they’re wrong. The code is 
generated randomly every time you find all the children. The way it’s 
generated is in the order in which you find the children. Better off 
just playing the hide-N-seek game. Record the numbers they give you 
after you beat there Hide-N-Seek game. Now you have the key to access 
Astral Observatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS TO FIND: Moon Tear, Inverted Song of Time, Song of Double Time


Now that you have the code, you may access the Bomber Crew’s hang-out 
spot, Astral Observatory. Run south, out of the North Clock Town. Go 
along the left side of the clock tower past the Owl statue again. Run 
through the town square and under the string of flags hanging down. 
Watch out for this white dog running loose around here. He will try to 
attack and bite you. Although it does no damage, it is highly annoying. 
Think about it, your like one giant fetch stick to him... Turn left at 
the block with the red sign painted on it. Go up these stairs, to East 
Clock Town. 

Go to opposite end of East Clock Town, and trot up the steps.  Look to 
the right, you should see the entrance to Astral Observatory. It is a 
small hole in the wall blocked by a Bomber Kid wearing a yellow 
bandanna. Talk to the kid, set the code you earned on the spin wheels, 
and press A. Once the passage is clear, stroll on in. 

You must do a little spelunking in the sewers before you reach the 
observatory itself. Travel down the narrow brick corridor till you reach 
a large sewer chamber housing a small creek of water and some flickering 
torches. Move your attention to the right of the room. Run up to the 
creek. Skip across the water to the first little brick island. Move to 
the second, then the third, then left into the sewer tunnel alcove. The 
place with the source of the water creek. 

Scamper over to dry land, about 15 feet before the opening at the end. 
Watch out, a Skulltula will shoot down from the rafters and try to 
strike at you. Kill it and run in the through the opening. Turn right 
and run into the circular room. There are some pots along the walls here 
if you need magic energy. Shoot the balloon that’s in the way, for it 
prevents access to the ladder. Run over and climb up it.

Go forward into the darkness and keep running, you will reach the bottom 
floor of Astral Observatory. A enchanting music fills the air, like it 
was played on a Glass Harmonica. In this hexagonal room, you should see 
some rainbow painted stairs spiraling upwards and a small carrot patch 
with a scarecrow underneath them. Go over and talk to the scarecrow. 
Now, “Dance the night away” with him. Do this until it is the night of 
the final day. After you dance with him, he will tell you a tip more 
valuable then gold in this game. Which is if you play the Song of Time 
backwards, it will slow the flow of time, playing every note twice lets 
you skip half a day forward. After your scarecrow chat, climb up the 
rainbow stairs. 

When you reach the top, you will see a tie-dye stage holding the 
observing end of the telescope. Jump up on top and run around the  
telescope end. Talk to the friendly hunchback-man in the blue tunic. He 
likes how polite your manners are, and says that Skull Kid was causing 
trouble for him. “He said he’d break my equipment. He said he’d steal my 
Moon’s Tear. There was no stopping him.” Say yes to his question and 
look into the telescope. Aim it at the top of the Clock Tower and zoom
in. The Clock Tower should have a light spinning at the top. 

A cinema scene will start rolling. Skull Kid is up on the clock tower 
roof. Shaking his head back and forth, he awaits the arrival of the 
falling moon! It is almost ready to begin its final descent, and now is 
only about 400 feet in the air. The telescope now zooms in on the 
menacing face upon the moon. A small gem falls out of its eye and 
crashes to the ground in a thunderous thud.

The cinema scene ends, take Link over to the door on the wall. Open it 
and walk outside, look over to your left on the grass. A small crater 
and a gem will be present. Go over and pick up the blue object. You just 
got the Moon Tear! “Its sparkling beauty radiates rather strangely.” Go 
back inside through the door you just came from. Run all the way down 
the stairs, exit the observatory, retrace you steps back through the 
sewer and exit out back into town. Time for a showdown.

THINGS TO FIND: Land Title Deed


By now, it should be pretty late at night on the third day. Go into 
South Clock Town. You should see a Deku Flower that is golden yellow in 
color. It is located next to the gray wall and a small canal of water. 
Walk on over to it, and a Deku Scrub will get flustered and tell you not 
to mess around with his private property. It informs you that he’s 
looking for a gift for his wife, the gem that “shines brighter than no 
other.” Hand over your hard-earned Moon Tear to the Deku Scrub and in 
return, he will give you a Land Title Deed. This gives your ownership to 
this small piece of land with the Deku Flower included. Once the 
transaction is complete, the Deku Scrub packs up shop and flies away 
into the night. Just sit and wait for the time to go by.

THINGS TO FIND: 1 Heart Piece, Ocarina of Time, Song of Time


When the clock strikes midnight, the Clock Town Carnival will begin! A 
scene plays showing fireworks exploding in the sky. The “Eye of Truth” 
doors on the side of the Clock Tower open up to form a staircase. Use 
the Deku Flower and flowercopter over to the ledge next to the newly 
opened entrance. Even though instructions to collect heart pieces are in
another section, I’ll make an exception in this case. Collect the heart 
piece just sitting here in plain site. Climb up the stairs and go to the 
roof of the tower. 

Cinema begins to play on the screen. Link looks around uneasily... he 
spots Skull Kid hovering high in the air, watching the incoming moon. He 
senses he is being watched and turns around to face Link. He reveals the 
stolen Ocarina from his pocket and evilly throws it up and down in his 
hand. Overwhelmed with joy, Tatl greets her brother. But fearing for his 
safety, Tael still sticks to the side of Skull Kid. “Swamp. Mountain. 
Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... the four who are there... bring them here...”

Angrily Skull Kid smacks Tael aside for his outburst. “Don’t speak out 
of line stupid fairy!!!” Tatl gets furious at the prospect of this 
mischief-maker abusing her brother, but Skull Kid just laughs. He 
screams at the top of his lungs and a magic waves fly at you from his
mask. The battle has begun! Defeat Skull Kid and get back your Ocarina.
For details on how to defeat him, see the boss characters section.

THINGS TO FIND: Song of Healing, Deku Scrub Mask


Okay, hopefully you are now warping back to the dawn of day one. As you 
warp back, cinema begins showing Link fall down through a spiral of 
spinning white clocks, shedding away his excess of rupees and Deku Nuts. 
Glimpses of Link’s encounters with Skull Kid and the Happy Mask Trader 
flash around in his head. He reappears with Tatl next to him just 
outside the Clock Tower exit. Tatl pipes up and states “W-What just 
happened?! Everything has... started over...” To confirm this astounding 
statement, Link runs forward and peers up at the moon. Sure enough, it 
is back up high in the sky. 

Your fairy friend reminds you of the deal you made with the Happy Mask 
Trader. You now gain control of Link. Run forward and open the doors. 
Enter in to the Clock Tower. Pace down the stairs and go over and speak 
to the Happy Mask Trader. He shakes you with glee! “Oh! Oh! Ohhh!!! You 
got it!” Listen carefully to the song he plays to you on his organ. Now, 
repeat the notes on your Ocarina. Pink halos with hearts engulf your 
body. Once again, another dream sequence starts to happen within Link’s 
mind. However this time, it is a good dream, rather then a nightmare. It 
shows Link walking away and waving goodbye to a giant Deku Scrub. Link 
transforms back into his old form, a small Deku Scrub mask falls on the 
floor near is feet. 

The Happy Mask Trader tells you that “This is a melody that heals evil 
magic and troubled spirits, turning them into masks.” He is very polite 
and gives you the Deku Scrub mask in commemoration of this special day. 
Time to fulfill your end of the bargain. Since he changed you back to 
your normal form, time to return the mask that was stolen from him. 
Unfortunately for you... you don’t have it. Link looks down blankly at 
the floor. The Happy Mask Trader is no longer happy! He gets infuriated 
and anger streaks across his face. Ripping you off the ground, he shakes 
you tempestuously in the air. The Happy Mask Trader begins to tell you 
the legend behind the stolen mask. What was stolen from him... was none 
other then Majora’s Mask itself!
 
According to the legend, It was used in hexing rituals by ancient 
tribesman. One who wears the mask is filled with evil and wickedness. 
The ancients feared the misuse of the mask so much, they decided to seal 
it away forever in the “Shadow Realm.” Informing you that he took 
painstaking efforts to track down the mask, he finally got it only to 
have it stolen away by the mischievous Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Trader 
pleads and begs you that if you don’t get back that mask soon, something 
terrible will surely happen. Take control of the newly transformed Link 
and exit out of the clock tower.

When you exit out into town, Tatl vents her feelings and tells you that 
you must do something to stop Skull Kid. But she is puzzled on exactly 
how to do it. “...The swamp, mountains, ocean, and canyon that Tael was 
trying to tell us about...” Tatl suggests that you must start some 
place, and to try heading south to the swamp. Follow her advice. But 
first, head forward and to the right. Run up the wooden ramp. Remember 
that Owl Statue? Walk over to the front of it and strike it once with 
the blade of your sword. A sphere of green light will emerge and the 
wings unfold. You have just activated your first Owl Statue. 

For the time being, they are useless to you until you learn the Song of 
Soaring. Get out your newly won Ocarina of Time. On it, play the 
Inverted Song of Time. This will slow down the passage of time, making a 
minute double the length, very useful. If you don’t know how to do this, 
see my “Ocarina Songs” section. Go back to the entrance of the Clock 
Tower. Run through the town square past the white dog. Keep going till 
you pass the building under construction and over to the exit. You 
should see a lone solider with a spear guarding the way. Go speak with 
him. He will at first try to stop you from leaving, but since your 
mature enough to carry a sword, he lets you past. Exit out of Town.

THINGS TO FIND: Southern Swamp


The view opens up and you are now in Termina Field. A upbeat music 
starts to play. If any of you have played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to 
the Past for Super Nintendo, then this music will sound strikingly 
similar. Continue and walk off the wooden porch. Run along down the 
middle of the posts so there on either side of you. Go just past the 
small bushes and kill the Green Chuchu here. Collect the Magic Jar from 
it. Keep going till your reach a hollow tree trunk, run through that as 
well. Just ahead, you should see a tan tree with what appears to be a 
carving on it. Trot over to it. 

Tatl thinks back to when her and Tael carved that image the first day 
they met Skull Kid. A cinema scene begins to play. It is raining heavily 
in Termina field…Tatl and Tael are out flying around looking for some 
shelter. They finally spot a hollow tree trunk and go and hide under it. 
Sounds of shivers echo. The two fairies look over and spot Skull Kid 
huddled on the ground, shaking uncontrollably from the cold. The fairies 
comfort Skull Kid, making a new friend. Tatl and Tael hang out with 
Skull Kid, as he plays he ocarina, goofing off in the fields, and 
carving pictures. Tatl remembers when Skull Kid “got his power.” The 
next view shows the Happy Mask Trader lying unconscious on the ground, 
while Skull Kid steals Majora’s Mask from his backpack. 

Your now in control of Link again. Run around the tree and exit out of 
the Termina Field area. You enter into a small forested area. Travel 
along forward and slightly to left. Run over to the scrubs and cut them 
down to get the rupees. Kill another Green Chuchu. To your right should 
be a old dying tree. Be careful here, there are many Bad Bats up in the 
tree’s foliage. Make sure no Bad Bats are following you, and go past the 
dying tree. Kill the Red Chuchu and collect the heart if you need some 
health. You come to a fork in the road, take the right path. The left 
only comes to a dead-end with a small house. 

After you turn right, you should see the Tinkle the Map Salesmen 
floating high in the sky using a red balloon. You can buy a map of the 
upcoming area from him... but it costs 20 rupees. Quite frankly, it is a 
waste of time to buy. Just continue along and leave the grove. You have 
now entered into Southern Swamp.

THINGS TO FIND: Old Hags’ Potion Shop, Woods of Mystery


Now that your in Southern Swamp, trot forward. Run to the zebra-striped 
tree on your right, go past it and run to the corner. You should see a 
Mini Deku Baba, an owl statue, and two brown weeds. Activate the statue, 
and gather the items you get from cutting down the weeds. Run along the 
edge of the water to the beginning of the dock. Trot down to the end of 
the green wood dock and climb up the ladder. Forget the Deku Scrub 
positioned to your left. Walk forward and enter into the building.

You’re now in the “Tourist Information” building. Run over the plank 
floor and to the carpet on right, there will be a small dark window on 
the wall. Check out what is happening in there. It will say "Old Koume's 
Boat Cruise. Ticket Office Closed.” Follow the instructions it gives 
you, to visit the “Old Hags’ Potion Shop” in inquire about taking a 
cruise tour.  

Turn around and exit out of the building. Walk forward and off the 
wooden ledge. Fall down to the dock below. Look to your right, and you 
will see a trail of Lilly-pads leading off into the swamp. Set your Deku 
Scrub Mask onto a C button and then wear it. Will some struggling, Link 
will transform into a Deku Scrub. Run off the side of dock, skip Deku 
Scrub Link over the water to the first Lilly-pad, then the second. Then 
skip along past the orange colored pillar to the third. The fourth 
Lilly-pad will be right around this small corner. Move Deku Scrub Link 
past the gnarled tree and to the fifth and final one, then skip over to 
shore. On shore there should be a large ceramic pot bellowing smoke and 
a wooden over-hang sign. 

Travel under the over-hang and a sign will be to your left, “Magic Hag’s 
Potion Shop ahead.” Continue with the path, turn left with the bend. 
Make sure to keep a safe distance from the snapping Deku Baba here, and 
turn right and trot along. Turn left at the bend. Don’t bother with the 
Mini Deku Baba. Go forward and you will reach a large circular clearing, 
with a small flowing waterfall and the shop standing in the center of a 
shallow pond. The water is so shallow, you may walk on the ground 
contained underneath it. Walk over to the foundation of the Hags’ shop, 
the wooden base. Jump up on top, and climb up the ladder you see here. 
You will reach a second smaller wooden platform. The shop is appears to 
be shaped like a red magic jar. Open the engraved blue door and enter.
 
A familiar music starts, the same music in the Spirit Temple in Link’s 
previous adventure. Take off you Deku Mask, for they don’t cater to 
anything but humans here. Jog up to the old witch Kotake sitting behind 
the counter. Three jars of varied potion will be resting on the 
countertop. Kotake is not showing the best work ethic, and snoozing away
on the job. Start talking to the hag to get her to wake up. 

She will promote how great her potions work and ask if you are a Boat 
Cruise customer. You indeed are, and Kotake tells you that her sister 
Koume went out back to look for wild mushrooms. She is pretty late 
getting back, and asks you to find out what’s going on. Finish talking 
and exit back out of the shop. Go forward and jump down to the water 
below. Run around left of the wooden platform, going past the waterfall. 
Continue to the dry land where the gossip stone is. Move along the wall, 
another sign will be here. “Woods of Mystery. Beware the ferocious 
Turtles. Don’t worry, it sounds much worse then it is. Enter into the 
dark cave.

THINGS TO FIND: Koume the Witch

 
You are now in the Woods of Mystery. A white and brown monkey will be 
jumping up and down in the clearing in front of you. Go over and talk to 
the little guy. He will tell you to follow him, then take of running. 
Follow closely behind him. He will travel left, right, right, straight, 
left, and left. When following the monkey, keep a close eye on him for 
his movements are very eccentric. Any Snapped turtles you encounter 
should be ignored, just continue on your way. After your done following 
behind him, you will be in another clearing. 

The injured Koume is collapsed on the ground while two monkeys are 
attending to her. Go over and talk to the weary witch. She states that 
she was just minding her own business, trying to pick some mushrooms, 
when all of a sudden Skull came from behind and hit her. She is 
paralyzed and needs “something that gives energy.” Now that you have 
found what happened with her, exit through the dark cave behind her. The 
one partially obstructed by a sign. This will allow you to leave the 
Woods of Mystery and enter back into the watery clearing with the Hags’ 
potion shop.

THINGS TO FIND: Red Potion, Your first bottle


You’re back in the circular clearing, head forward across the water and 
to the wooden platform. Jump up on top of it and trot around the left 
side of the tree trunk, for it is a slightly shorter distance then going 
around the right side. Climb up the ladder and enter into the shop 
again. Go talk to once-again snoozing Kotake. Kotake is shocked at what 
has happened to her sister. “What’s that?!? The Skull Kid got Koume?!?” 
She doubts that Skull Kid has that kind of power, but gives you some 
medicine anyway. Good Job! You will receive some Red Potion and your 
first bottle! Exit out of the potion shop. Enter back into the Woods of 
Mystery now that you have something to revive Koume.

Follow that monkey again. Go over and talk to the injured Koume, giving 
the red potion for her to drink. She jumps up with glee and gulps it 
down. “Koume is revived!!!” With a blast of energy, the old witch is 
back to normal and hovering on her broomstick. She thanks you for 
helping her, and says she will give you a free Boat Cruise next time you 
stop by her business. Will a high-pitched cackle, Koume flies away into 
the sky. Exit out of the Woods of Mystery.

THINGS TO FIND: Free Cruise Boat ride, Pictograph Box


When you enter back into the clearing, a trio of monkeys will be 
blocking your path. Talk to the center one. He complements that you have 
special powers. And that strange things are going on. The swamp is 
filled with poisonous water and “temple above waterfall strange.” His 
brother went to the temple but was captured and being held hostage at 
the Deku Palace. You have better help out his brother. 

Time to retrace your steps. Run along past the shop and exit the 
clearing. Run back through the small path following avoiding the Deku 
Baba plants. Exit out past the over-hang sign. Use your Deku Scrub Mask 
and turn yourself into a Deku Scrub. Skip back along the Lilly-pads and
reach the green-wood dock. Jog over to the ladder and climb up it, enter
the “Tourist Information” building again. Remove your Deku Mask, Boat 
Cruises are for human-types only. Go back over to the darkened window.
Now Koume’s long nose and bugging eyes with be sticking out of the 
shadows. Talk to her. 

Koume thanks you again for helping her, and gives you a very special 
deal. You get one boat cruise for free, and she also gives you the free 
Pictograph Box. It is basically a primitive camera that can only develop 
one picture at a time. If you want to develop a picture, take one, then 
give the Pictograph Box to other man on the other side of this room. He 
is very large with a brown beard, you can’t miss him. The boat is now 
leaving! The next scene shows Link standing in the back of a small 
canoe. It departs from the waters beneath the “Tourist Information” 
building. A cheery carnival music starts to play. Disregard your 
Pictograph Box and sit back and enjoy the ride.
 
It slowly travels along, passing some water lilies, and a waterfall. At 
the end it reaches a small passageway, blocked by a pink and bulky 
Octolot. Normally this passage way would be impassable, but not anymore! 
The Cruise Boat rams itself into the Octolot, causing it to fall over 
and die. You sail through and are now in the Deku Kingdom.

THINGS TO FIND: The Deku Palace


Gelatinous purple water and reddish orange plants dot the landscape. The 
cruise boat pulls up to a small dock and stops. Make sure you heed the 
warning about the poisonous water, don’t swim in it or you will face 
almost certain death from health depletion. Say yes, and disembark from 
the ship. After you disembark from the ship, exit onto the docks and run 
down to the end of them. You monkey friend will be in front of you, but 
leap away when you get near. Run across the grass and through the 
striped entry way.

THINGS TO FIND: Deku King, Magic Beans, bottle of fresh Spring Water,
Monkey Cage, Sonata of Awakening

 
You enter in to the outer grounds of Deku Palace. The scene shows you 
standing on a small grass area. Looming ahead is the large Deku Palace 
complex. It its botanical spires tower up into the sky. A regal upbeat 
music begins to play. 

Take out your Deku Mask and change into a Deku Scrub. Run forward over 
they grass and to the end of the first log raft. Hop over to the second 
trio-log raft, and then the third. Only two Deku Guardsman block the 
entrance to the palace complex. And from the looks of them, there 
definitely inept at the job. Speak to one of the guardsmen. “This is the 
palace of the Deku Kingdom. Only those on official business may enter!” 
But today is your lucky day. They tell you that it is a special occasion 
and allow you to enter to see the punishment of a monkey that angered 
there king. They tell you to only go straight ahead, and enter no other 
part of the palace. Pass the guards and enter into the first corridor.

Run down the center of the open-roofed corridor and all the way down to 
the end. Go through the striped entry way. You enter into the “Deku 
King’s Chamber.” A great bon fire is burning in a pit in the center. A 
large leafed throne is in the background. The Deku King and has four 
subjects are all dancing around. Run around the right side of the bon 
fire and over to the stage where the subjects are. You can talk to them 
if you wish. They say that its rumored that the monkey ate the Deku 
Princess. Jump up onto the stage. 

Walk over and strike conversation with His Highness the Deku King. He is 
wearing a large crown of dried leaves and holds a pink flower scepter, 
you’ll instantly spot him dancing on his throne. He questions you if 
your a visitor since he has never seen you around before. The Deku King 
rudely states that normally he would never let someone of your low 
status into his Royal Chamber, but that today is special. “Were about to 
punish the foolish monkey who kidnapped the Deku Princess.” Finish up 
speaking with His Highness, then head up the ramp left of the stage. Go 
to the edge of the wood cage and talk to the prisoner monkey who’s 
struggling to get his ropes free. He claims no wrong doing and that if 
they don’t save the Deku Princess soon, she will be a victim to a 
monster. Turn away from the cage and jump off the ledge to the dirt 
floor below. Run forward and slightly right and exit. 

You come out into the open roof corridor. The difference is your monkey 
friend you met from the swamp is now here. Walk over and talk to him. 
The monkey asks if his brother is doing all right and that he knows a 
secret route of access to his cage. He states the point of entry is from 
the Outer Garden. It is in a tall place, so “Need bean from bean seller. 
Live beneath palace garden.” Hurry, help stop this monkey trouble! After 
he finishes talking, the monkey will run away. Go forward and turn left 
and enter into the Inner Palace Garden. 

The view of the game changes to and overhead one. Your objective is to 
get to the other end of the garden to the Magic Bean Salesman without 
being spotted by the Deku Patrollers. Your not allowed to be there, so 
they are on the lookout for any intruders. This task is not that 
difficult. There is no way for me to write walkthrough on this part, for 
the guards move at random intervals. Just wing it, you’ll do fine. I do 
have three tips however. One, use the scenery to hide yourself from the 
view of the Deku Patrollers. Two, make sure to only make a move when 
your sure that there not staring in the direction of where your at. And 
three, be patient. Don’t rush your self or you will get caught by them 
and thrown out of the palace grounds, having to run back and try again. 

There are only 3 Deku Patrollers in the first section of the garden. 
When you make it to the end, exit through the passage way. You will now 
be in the second section of the garden. This is trickier then the first 
half, but still really not that hard to play. There are only 2 guards 
here. Make it to the end, then fall into the dark hole.

When you land on the ground, you will be in a small grassy cavern. Right 
away, turn left and run through the thick grass and up the small 
incline. Here there will be a chubby kid sitting on carpet eating some 
beans. Go and talk to him. He says that your the first customer he has 
in a very long time. And gives you one free sample of Magic Beans. 
Listen to him, make sure to plant the beans in soft soil, and to water 
them. Turn right and go down the small slope. Turn left and run all the 
way to the back wall. You should see a small puddle of water here. Take 
off your Deku Mask and transform back to normal form, for Dekus can’t 
sink in water. Get out the empty bottle in you inventory. Wad a little 
ways into the water and scoop up a small quantity. Now you have the fuel 
for the Magic Beans. Turn around and run up past the brown soft soil 
spot. A common mistake is to plant here, don’t do it. Jog over to the 
middle of the spotlight. 

You are teleported to right in front of the hole on the surface. Your 
back in the garden, go over and purposely get caught by a guard. “Aha! 
An intruder!” You get thrown out to the front of the palace, onto the 
trio-log rafts leading to the entrance. Put your Deku Mask back on. Look 
over to your right. You will see a trail of Lilly-pads. Skip on over to 
the first one. The sign reads “Outer Palace Garden ahead.” Turn about 45 
degrees to the right. Run across the water to the second Lilly pad. Turn 
about 45 degrees again, this time to the left. Travel over to the next 
pad. Now just hop along the trail of Lilly-pads you see. Caution though, 
these are far a part and will take your full 4 to 5 skips across the 
water. At the end of the Lilly-pads, skip over to the grassy bank. There 
will be two trees and a clove of thick grass at the back wall. Go 
forward and to the left, a soft soil spot will be here, Brown in color 
with a black dot in the center. 

Stand on the edge of it. Take off your Deku Mask. Get out your Magic 
bean from your inventory. Set it to a C button and plant it. A tiny 
three-leafed sprout will emerge. This is no good in its present state. 
Get out your bottle of collected spring water. Pour it over the plant 
and soil. Ta-dah! The tiny sprout will grow into a full sized Bean Plant 
Hoverpad.
 
Jump on top of the Hoverpad and ride it up into the air. Jump left into 
the alcove. Put on your Deku Mask again. Rut to the end of the small 
path and drop to the wooden ledge with the Deku Flower below. Walk over 
and stand on top of the flower. Use the C-up button. Look over at the 
moving platform with a Deku Flower on it. Time for some Aerobatics. 
Don’t fall down, or you will have to start over. It will be ahead and a 
little to the right. After you spot it, dive into the Deku Flower. Wait 
inside... Wait for the platform to move towards you, then launch 
yourself out and flowercopter over to it. Land and turn your attention 
to the left. There will be a Deku Sniper on a wooden tower shooting Deku 
nuts at you. Fire a large bubble at him and kill him off. Stand on top 
of the flower and look in the direction of the tower. 

Dive down into the Deku Flower. You will see a log wall, past the tower 
with a section cut out of it. Look through that, and there will be 
another platform with a Deku Flower moving back and forth. Wait until 
your and that platform are in linear alignment, then shoot out and glide 
over to the second moving platform. Land carefully, you can tell by 
looking at your shadow beneath you. Turn to your left and kill this Deku 
Sniper. Using your C button, look past this wooden tower and you will 
see and ledge with two pots on it, and a exit. Use the flower and glide 
over to it when the platform is closest to it. Land on the ledge and run 
out the exit. Your half done will the Flower Power course. 

Run through the small tunnel and across the breezeway. Don’t hall off or 
you will have to go back over across the lake, ride the hoverpad and do 
the first section again. Continue through the second small tunnel. You 
enter out onto the second half of the Inner palace Garden. Your on a 
wooden ledge with a Deku Flower. Look slightly to your right, you will 
see another Deku Sniper shooting nuts at you. Your out of range so you 
wouldn’t get hit. Kill him anyway since he will try to shoot your down 
when your in the air. Look past the tower and you will see another 
platform with a Deku Flower on it moving back and forth. Dive into the 
flower near you. Wait till it just starts to move towards you and launch 
your self out. Glide over and land. 

Look to your right, over the gap in the wall. Kill the Deku Sniper. Bury 
yourself into the flower. Look way across the wall and to the other end 
of that garden section. You will see a platform traveling back and forth 
slowly. Wait till both platforms are lined up, the glide over. This is 
the trickiest jump due to the sheer distance of the jump. Land on it and 
feel a sigh of relief, the worst is over. Look up and to your right. On 
the green wall, you will see a ledge and an exit. This is the entrance 
to the Monkey’s cage. Dive into the flower. Wait for it to travel over 
near the wall, upwards, then pause. Shoot out and glide over to the 
platform. Enter into the darkness.
 
You’re now in the King’s Chamber again, but the key difference is you 
are inside the Monkey’s Cage. Run forward off the ledge. Hop down from 
the wicker box. The monkey is on the pole straight ahead. Struggling to
free his ropes. Remove your Deku Mask, or he will think your just 
another Deku fool. Face him and Z-target. Talk to the monkey. He will 
tell you to be quiet or you will get captured. Now attempt to cut the 
ropes tying him to the pole. Run back past the pole and jump on to the
large box. Turn around and Z-target the monkey again. Running forward 
and leaping off the ledge, press B in midair. This will cause you to do 
a downward slash at the ropes. But… it does not sever them. The monkey 
says its no use, and asks you if you have a instrument that can make a 
lot of noise. Put back on your Deku Mask and whip out your Deku Pipes. 
“Deku Pipes! Those will work great!!!” The king glances over at the cage 
to take a look at what’s going on. 

He states to you his plight... He went to the Woodfall Temple above the 
waterfall to check out what could be behind the poisonous water in the 
swamps. Only to find that the temple had been turned into an evil 
monster’s lair. The princess was captured and now you must save her, 
going in his place. The monkey teaches you a melody that will allow you 
to enter Woodfall Temple. He hums the tune silently as to not draw 
attention. Repeat the notes he just hummed on your Deku Pipes. “You have 
learned the Sonata of Awakening. This melody awakens those who have 
fallen into a deep sleep.” The King hears you playing the song. This 
convinces him that the monkey tricked the princess so he could enter the 
temple. The Deku King gives the order to commence on the monkey’s 
punishment. Two Deku Guardsman rush in and grab a hold of you, Oh no. 
You’re thrown back to the palace entrance. You know what to do next...       

You’re sitting on the tri-log rafts again, after being “royally”
thrown out of the palace. Look to your right. Skip across the water to
the Lilly-pad. Look about 45 degrees to the right, and skip to this next
pad. This time, instead of going to the Outer Place Garden, your on the
way to Woodfall. Skip on over to the small grass ledge with the Deku
Flower. The sign reads: “Woodfall Shortcut. For use by Deku Scrubs
only.” Jump inside the Deku Flower and launch into the air. Glide over
into the small alcove and enter.

THINGS TO FIND: Song of Soaring, Woodfall


You will come out on the other side, on the top of a large orange 
mushroom. Two annoying Dragonfly’s with be flying around in the air to
your left, kill them off. Mushroom Hoppin’ time. Walk to the center of
the mushroom-top where the Deku Flower is. To your right, in the 
distance will be the next mushroom. Jump in the flower, shoot over to
there and land. Look left, use this Deku Flower and glide over to the
next mushroom. On this mushroom will be yet again another Deku Flower.
Use it and glide to the twisted rock formation. After you land, run up
the slope and to the left to get on the mushroom. Turn left, past the
small river with be the waterfall. Next to it a small ledge with a large
owl perched on a stone tablet. Get inside the Deku Flower and launch
yourself into the air. Copter over to ledge and land.
 
The owl will begin speaking with you. “What business might you have in 
this poisoned swamp?” The owl informs you that the swamp has lost its 
guardian deity and that if you have the courage he will give something 
very useful. The owl is the one who has placed those Owl statues across 
the land, with them you can warp to one location to another. He flies 
away into the sky. Look at the tablet that was at his feet, a song is 
carved upon it. Link gets out his Deku Pipes and plays the tune. Now 
repeat the notes you just heard. “You learned the Song of Soaring! This 
melody swoops you up and sends you soaring to a stone bird statue in an 
instant.” Turn to your right and get in the Deku Flower. Launch into the 
air and glide across, passing the waterfall, and landing on the ledge on 
the other side of it. Run forward and turn into the cave.

THINGS TO FIND: Woodfall Temple 


You have arrived in Woodfall. Your on a small plot of land with some 
bushes. You have a few things to tidy up before attempting to take on 
Woodfall Temple. 

Turn to your right and run past the bushes. Run of the edge of the land 
and skip across the water to the Lilly-pad. Now skip over to the small 
dirt island. Don’t fall of the ramps or you will have to start all over 
again. Shed off your Deku Mask, turn and run up the wood ramp. Kill the 
Hiploop here. Run up the rest of the length of the ramp to the stone 
tear at the top. Turn left, and run up this next ramp. Kill this 
Hiploop, run up to the top of the ramp and get rid of the Mad Scrub. A
Deku Flower will appear beneath where he was. Put on your Deku Mask, 
dive into the flower. Shoot out and glide over the island a ways in 
front of you. Kill the Mad Scrub. Turn to your left, running across the
thin bridge. Get rid of this next Mad Scrub you find at the end. Jump 
into the flower and flowercopter over to the wooden island erected in
the water. 

You should see strings of flags, a pedestal with the image of a Deku 
Scrub, and an owl statue. Take off your Deku Mask. Now this is very 
important, activate the owl statue beside you first, then take out your
Ocarina. Play the Song of Time. Say yes, save your game and warp back to
the dawn of the first day. 

Your now at the entrance to the Clock Tower in South Clock Town. Get out 
your Ocarina again. Play the Song of Soaring, select the Woodfall statue 
and warp. The screen will turn red and Link will sprout wings. They wrap 
upon themselves and encase Links body in a large egg. The egg disappears 
with a puff of feathers. Your now back at the platform again. Take out 
your Ocarina for the third time. Play the Inverted Song of Time and slow 
down the flow of the minutes. Now you have a full three days, on slowed 
time to beat Woodfall Temple. Turn around and stand on the pedestal. Put 
on your Deku Mask transforming yourself into a Deku Scrub.
 
Now get out your Deku Pipes, this instrument makes a lot more noise then 
the Ocarina of Time. Play the Sonata of Awakening. The whole ground 
starts to tremble in a violent shaking motion. Up ahead a huge surge of 
water rises up. It swishes outwards revealing the newly risen Woodfall 
Temple! After it has stopped rising, run forward and jump into the Deku 
Flower. Now shoot out and glide forward over to the ledge on the side of 
the temple. This jump is tricky, you will have only enough flowercopter 
power to just barely make it. Walk to the Woodfall Temple entrance and 
enter into the unknown...

COMPLETE MAP OF WOODFALL TEMPLE

This map is only a bonus aide to you. The walkthrough I have written is 
self-sufficient, but I decided to make this map so you may better see 
the inner workings of Woodfall Temple. Remember, if you see a capital 
letter in (), there was no room and continues to where you find the 
other matching letter in the ()s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Your now in the first temple of the game, Woodfall Temple. Slow-paced 
jungle rhythm begins to play. This is the first chamber, a dimly lit, 
huge room with large tree branch columns. Starting out on a small ledge 
area with a Deku Flower, get an empty bottle read. Turn to your right 
and break the ceramic pot you see. A fairy that looks like Tatl, but 
pink will come out. Scoop it up into the bottle. This fairy will fly out 
of the bottle and revive you when you have used up all your life energy. 
Turn and run to the left corner of the small ledge and stand on the Deku 
Flower. Look out into the distance, there will be a half of a tree 
branch column with a flat surface and with a Deku Flower for you to land 
on. Dive into the Deku Flower and glide over to it. Land and turn to 
your right. 

Look out into the distance again, past the tree branch column to the 
right and you will see a platform with a treasure chest. Jump into the 
flower and glide all the way over there. Land on the platform. There is 
a Fairy in this chest, but tracking down Temple fairies can be found in 
the temple fairies section. Facing the treasure chest, look left to see 
another half of a tree branch column with a Deku Flower upon it. Get 
into the Deku Flower here and flowercopter over to it and land. As you 
were gliding in the air, to your left, you should have seen an area with 
two lit torches and an exit door. Get into the Deku Flower and glide 
over to the stage. Landing on the edge, in the center of it. Watch out, 
for two Skulltulas with come down from the ceiling just to the left and 
right of you. Run forward past the torches and exit out the door.
 
Your now in the second chamber, this is the Woodfall Temple Altar Room. 
A large wooden flower is in the center and poisonous purple water covers 
most of the floor. Tatl complains “Yah! That stench! This place stinks 
just like the poison swamp!” You start out on a little dirt area with a 
Deku Baba to your left. Turn right and run of the edge and fall down to 
the water below. Skip over the water to the platform with five pots on 
it. From here, turn left and skip over the water to the small area with 
the three totem-columns. Turn right and exit out of the door. You come 
to this third chamber.

In the center of a sea of poisoned water will be a small dirt island 
with a Deku Flower on it. Four Snapper Lilly-pads will be in a 
concentric circle around it. On this little area you start at, run off
the right corner and skip across the water to the Lilly-pad. Turn 
slightly left and skip over to the Deku Flower. Look to your left, you
will see a brick area with a gold-lined treasure chest and two lit 
torches. Jump into the flower and glide over. Land and walk up to the
chest. Opening it, you got a small key! Turn around, and run of the 
right corner and skip across the water. Get to the Lilly-pad and turn
left running back to the Deku Flower. Turn slightly left, you will see
another brick area. This time with a door and two torches on either
side. Dive into the flower and glide over there and land. 

Enter into the door. You are no longer alone. There are three Snapper 
Turtles in this room. Kill them off using the Deku Flowers (remember, 
you can always look in the enemy section on strategies to kill your 
foes.) and a large treasure chest will materialize. It will appear in 
the small puddle of water at the center of the room. Go over and open 
it. You have just gotten the Dungeon Map! This will greatly help you 
navigate around the temple. On the map, clear rooms have not be visited 
yet, will blue rooms have. Your current location is indicated by the 
flashing room. Turn around and run to the door, exiting out of it.

Run forward right off the ledge, skipping across the water to the Deku 
Flower island. Skip across this next gap of water and over to the stone 
ledge. Go over and open the door and exit out. Your now back into the 
Woodfall Temple Altar Room. 

Trot forward and around the column and skip across the water to the 
first Snapper Lilly-pad here. Turn left, and hop across the water to the 
next pad. Turn slightly right and skip to the final pad. Skip along the 
water over to the moss-covered brick bank. A Deku Baba will be to your 
left, kill it off. Along the back wall with be a door with a silver lock 
and chains on it. Walk up to it and open it. The locks with retract away 
from using the key you collected before. Enter through the door.
 
This room is covered in a pond of poisonous swamp water. Primitive 
wooden systems of catwalk run along the room. Ahead of you will be a 
granite block with a emblem of Majora’s Mask on it. Trot up to it, Tatl
will tell you “This looks pretty light. Well don’t just stand there — “
Run up against the block and press forward till you no longer can. The
catwalks will divide into two directions now. Turn right and run down to
the end. From here, turn right again, head down, then turn left. Go and
turn at the corner here and travel towards the lit torch. Swamp 
Butterflies will be swarming around the light source. Step carefully, a
Skulltula with pop down from the ceiling on the right side of the torch.
Kill it off then turn left and run down to the head of the catwalk. 

Turn left and run up to the block, press it forward as far as it will 
go. Turn around and run back, then turn right and run back to the lit 
torch. Remove your Deku Mask, turning back into human Link. Get out a 
Deku Stick and light the end of it on the torch. Turn around and once 
again run back down the catwalk. Turn left and trot towards the granite 
block. Turn right at the intersection and at the end you will see a 
barred door and a unlit torch. Travel down to the torch, waving the 
flaming end of the Deku Stick over it. It will light into flames and the 
barred door will open up. Press B to get rid of the Deku stick. The 
Swamp butterflies are now swarming around this lit torch. Go over and 
open the door, entering into the room.

The door shuts behind you and bars lock over it. Your in a room puddled 
with water and dotted with a few Deku Flowers. Two Dragonflies will be 
overhead. Put back on your Deku Mask. Kill off both of the Dragonflies. 
The door’s bars will be lifted and a treasure chest will materialize 
near the back of the room. Run over to the chest and open it. You have 
now gotten the compass. This will show where treasure chests are on your 
map and where the boss lurks at. Jog back to the door and exit back out 
in the room with the catwalks.

Remove your Deku Mask and get out a Deku Stick. Run over to the now-lit 
torch. Light the end of the Deku Stick, turn around and run across the 
bit of catwalk. Turn left at the corner and head up the stairs. At the 
top, light the torch your find here. The Swamp Butterflies will again 
follow you up here and swarm the light source which you have just 
provided them. Light another Deku stick and run right and jump over the 
gap to the platform. Link does an impressive somersault-jump. Turn left 
and jump over this gap to the next platform. The Swamp Butterflies may 
hurt you a little since there after the flaming stick you carry, but the 
damage is very minor. Jump to the ledge setting a flame the cobweb. Run 
in and 2 Deku Babas will be to your left. Kill them off to get the prize 
of a Deku Stick. Run forward out the corridor here and Link will travel 
up a spiraling staircase here. 

At the top the light becomes very dim and menacing. Tatl is worried at 
the surroundings. “Be careful, I sense a lot of evil here.” Run down the 
very dark hallway. About 4 Black Boes will materialize near the end. 
Kill them off. A little ways in front, you should see a small room with 
a simmering torch on a raised stage, the only source of light. And a 
barred door on the left side. Trot into the room and over to the torch. 
Jump up onto the stage where it is sitting. Four Black Boes will appears 
here. Get rid of them and get out a Deku Stick. Lit it and turn right, 
run past a pillar and to the wall. Ignore any Black Boes tailing you. 
Run along this back wall and light the first torch, then the second, 
then the third next to a barred door. After all three torches are lit, 
the door bars will retract. Put out your flaming Deku Stick and head 
through the door.

This chamber is huge in size with large tree branch columns. Deep holes 
dot the floor, don’t fall in them or you will plummet back down to the 
Woodfall Temple Altar Room. You start off on a area high up, with a Deku 
Flower. Put your Deku Mask back on and dive into the Deku Flower. In the 
distance ahead, you will see a small platform with a Deku Flower upon it 
moving back and forth. Wait till it is traveling left, and has just 
passed behind the tree branch column. Shooting out of the flower, glide 
over and on the small platform. A pair of Dragonflies will be buzzing 
around in the air here. Wait till you get there attention then kill 
them. Look perpendicular to the direction the platform is traveling. You 
will see a second platform traveling back and forth. Duck into the 
flower beneath your feet. Wait till the other platform is traveling 
right and both of them are about linear. Launch out, glide over, land. 

From here, glance and look in the direction this platform is moving. You 
will spot a small ledge in the corner, with an exit with two large totem 
poles on either side. Get into the flower and wait till it has traveled 
as close to the ledge as possible, then travel over to it and land. 
Enter into the doorway and Link will travel down a spiraling staircase.
 
Your now back in the Woodfall Temple Altar Room, except that your on a 
ledge on the back wall, higher up. Ahead you will see a brown “lump” 
sticking out of the floor. Run over to it. Remove your Deku Mask and 
step on the switch as normal Link. This will cause two ladders to 
appear, providing easy access from the bottom area of the altar room to
the top ledge. Turn right and exit out of the door you find here. 

Your in that room with the snapper Lilly-pads and Deku Flower island, 
but your once again higher upon a ledge. Spin to your left and run down 
to the edge of stone ledge. Turn right at the corner, trot to the end 
here and out of the door. 

Link enters in a large, open air room. All of a sudden, the camera zooms 
in on the roof. Through a small hole, a Dinofols jumps down to the 
floor. It rears up and hisses at you. Boss music begins to play. This is 
the first Mini-Boss of Woodfall Temple. For information on how to defeat 
the Dinofols, check the Bosses section. After defeating him, a treasure 
chest will appear in the center of the room. Go over and open it up. You 
just got the Hero’s Bow! Make sure to equip it on a C-button. Turn 
around and run over to the door, exiting out of the room.
 
Run forward and stand on top of the Deku Flower here. Get out your bow 
and load in an arrow. If you aim ahead, across the room you will see a 
ledge with a door. On the side of the ledge will be a eye inside a 
golden square. Aim carefully and shoot the arrow to poke the eye. It 
will close shut and the Deku Flower island below will begin to move up 
and down. Put away your bow and put on your Deku Mask. Dive into the 
flower. Launch and glide over to the moving island whenever you are 
ready. Land and duck into the flower here. Wait until the platform has
paused at it’s maximum altitude then shoot out. Glide over and land on 
the stone ledge. Run forward and open the door.

You enter a large room, bars cover the door behind you. The room
is covered with a thin layer of water and dotted with Deku Flowers. Boss
music begins again and the camera zooms in on the second Mini-Boss,
Gekko. Take off your Deku Mask and the battle has now begun. For 
information on how to defeat the Gekko, see the bosses section. After 
you defeat Gekko, he will shrink and turn into a small gray frog, just 
croaking and hopping up and down. The door you entered with unlock, 
along with a door on the opposite end of the room leading into a vine 
bar cage. 

Run over to the door on the front of the cage. Open it and run in. You 
will immediately spot a blue, gold-lined treasure chest. Go over to it 
and open it up. “You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber 
where the boss lurks!” Good job! Your now ready to take on the boss of 
Woodfall Temple. Turn around and open the door exiting the vine cage. 
Run all the way to the other side of them room and exit out. 

Put on your Deku Mask. Run forward and dive into the Deku Flower right 
in front of you. In front of you will be a small island with a Deku 
Flower on it traveling up and down. Shoot out and glide over to the 
small platform. Turn to your right and you will see the ledge with the 
exit door. Dive into the flower and wait for the platform to pause at 
the highest altitude. Launch from the flower and glide towards the door. 
Land on the ledge and walk through. Your now back in the Woodfall Temple
Altar room again.

Take off your Deku Mask. Run forward and stand on the center of the 
compressed switch. If you look down, over the edge you will see a pillar 
with a torch on it with some Swamp Butterflies swarming it. Below and 
beyond that will be the wooden flower with an unlit torch in the center. 
Get out your Hero’s Bow and load in an arrow. Aim it so that when you 
shoot the arrow, it will fire down through the lit torch, and hit the 
unlit torch. This will cause it to catch on fire. The wooden flower’s 
pedals will unfold and the flower will grow tall enough to be at the 
same elevation as the ledge your standing on. It begins spinning around 
on its axis. 

Turn right, end down to the corner of the ledge and turn left. Run all 
the way down, past the barred door to the pillar at the end. Run to the 
left side of it. If you look of the edge, you will see a twisted tree 
branch sticking out will and unlit torch on it. You must light this to 
unlock the door beside you. Turn yourself around and run forward and to 
the left. Jump on to a pedal of the spinning flower and run to the 
center off it where the inertia is less severe. Face the lit torch here. 
Gain bearing as to where the unlit torch is in relationship to you and 
get out your bow. Load in a arrow and aim through the flame. Fire an 
arrow so it travels through this flame and hits the torch out on that 
tree branch. It is not to hard a task, maybe take 5 - 6 tries. Once the 
torch is in fact lit, the bars on the door will retract. Put away your 
bow. Run off a pedal of the wooden flower and jump over to the ledge, 
going towards the door. Go over and open it and step inside.

Your in another large room. This chamber is the last one, next stop is 
the temple boss. You start up in a high alcove with a Deku Flower. Run 
forward and climb down the ladder. Go down until you reach the bottom 
then turn around. Your on a small area with another Deku Flower that is 
surrounded by water. Trot forward and jump into the water. Swim on over 
to the little stone island. Climb up onto the dry area. Wait here until 
you get the attention of a Dragonfly, then kill it off. Put on your Deku 
Mask and use this flower next to you. Flowercopter forward to the higher 
potion of the small stone island. Once again wait for a second Dragonfly 
to take notice of you. Kill it off. You can collect the four blue rupees 
here if you wish. 

Turn around and jump back to down the lower potion of the island. Use 
the Deku Flower and glide back towards the ladder. Land and run to stand 
on the Deku Flower you find here. Facing the ladder, look to your right. 
You will see a small alcove with a ledge sticking out and a Deku Flower. 
Jump down into the flower your standing on and glide over to the alcove. 
Repeat again to the next alcove higher up. Then do this one more time.
 
Stand as far towards the edge, and as far right as possible. In this 
highest alcove look out into the room. You will see two pillars with 
flames on the top of them. Look past both of them and you will see a 
structure back in the distance. Looking carefully, you will see a small 
“crystal-diamond” shaped switch. Remove your Deku Mask and get out your 
bow with an arrow loaded in. Aim carefully, shoot a arrow so it hits the 
crystal-diamond switch. It will turn yellow and the flames on the top of 
the two pillars will die out. Quickly now, you must hustle or the flames 
will ignite again. Put on your Deku Mask. Look out, see the structure 
closest to you, with a roof. Jump into the Deku Flower at your side and 
glide over there, then pause right before you reach the room. Drift down 
slowly. When you lower then the roof, fly down to that Deku Flower. 
Stand on it, and turn your attention slight right. 

Face towards the pillars and dive into the flower. Shoot aloft and glide 
out of the structure, over the top of the first pillar, landing on the 
top of the second. Quickly now, dive into the Deku Flower right here and 
glide forward to the roof of this second structure. Your now safe, the 
flames should start bellowing in a few more seconds. Now look to your 
left. On the back wall there will be small area. On it will be a large 
door with a golden lock on it and a torch and two pots on either side. 
Dive into the Deku Flower on this roof and glide all the way over there.
 
Land on the stone area and forward up to the large door. Open it up and 
the chains will retract away and the golden lock will disappear. This 
uses up the Boss Key you got from fighting Gekko. Walk into the Boss 
Chamber of Woodfall Temple. The room is huge in dimensions. But also 
quiet and empty, almost too quiet. Trot forward to the center of the 
room. In an instant, from up above a large creature plunges down from a
hole in the ceiling. Massive in size, it as least 15 feet tall. This is
Odolwa, Mask Jungle Warrior. To defeat him, go see the bosses section. 
If you need help that is. After he is defeated, where his corpse lay a 
heart container appears. Go over and pick it up. “You got a Heart 
Container! Your maximum life energy is increased by one heart. You also 
get a full refill of life energy.” Run towards the center of the room. 
Now there will be a shimmering blue portal of light and object floating 
up and down within it. Walk into the center of it. The object turns out 
to be a mask. “You’ve seized Odolwa’s Remains!” This means you have 
freed a spirit that was trapped within Odolwa when he wore the mask. 

              You have just gotten the first Guardian Mask.

THINGS TO FIND: Oath to Honor


After you get Odolwa’s Remains, the shimmering portal of blue light will 
warp you away. You will reappear on a large stone pillar, in the center 
of chamber filled with white fog. All the objects in the room are blurry 
and distorted. Solemn music is playing as Link looks forward into the 
distance. A huge blurred creature stands out there. The thing appears to 
be crying out a tune of some sort. Tatl translates and says this may be 
the tune, causing Link to get out his Ocarina of Time. Now play the 
notes Tatl told you. A purple halo surrounds Links body and “You learned 
the Oath to Honor!” The creature then attempts to say something... “Call 
Us.” Link warps away in a flash of bright white light and appears in the 
last chamber of Woodfall Temple.  

A cinema scene begins to play. It shows the poisonous waters of the 
swamp draining away and being replaced with clean blue water. Tatl 
states that you must save the other three and that the next stop is the
mountains. She apologizes for stealing your horse and Ocarina. Link 
hears a ruffling sound and stops to look around. You can control of Link
again. Get out your Ocarina of Time. Play the Song of Time to save your 
game and warp back to the dawn of the first day.

Your now back at the entrance to the Clock Tower in South Clock Town. 
Your fairy friend Tatl states that “The quickest way to the mountains is 
through the North Gate!” However, your first task is to acquire a need 
weapon for your inventory, Bombs. Get out your Ocarina of Time. Play the 
Inverted Song of Time and slow down time’s flow. Head forward and to 
your right. Run up the wooden ramp here. Trot down past the owl statue 
to the end here and go up this second ramp. Run forward and to your left 
to exit into North Clock Town. 

Travel forward and slightly to your left over to the guard holding the 
spear. He lets you pass for your bearing a sword. “The mountains of 
Snowhead lie this way. Be careful.” Head on out of the North Gate into 
Termina Field.

THINGS TO FIND: At least 70 Rupees, some arrows, full Magic Meter


Turn and run right. Trot towards this Green Chuchu and small spot of 
shrubs. Kill off the Green Chuchu and chop down the shrubs to get any 
goodies you find in them. Continue this clockwise path all the way 
around the field covering the perimeter of Clock Town. You need to cut 
down bushes as you go to get at least 70 Rupees. If you do one full 
revolution and are all the way back to the North Gate again, enter in
and come back out and the bushes will be rejuvenated. Keep cutting down
all the bushes you find till you get the 70 Rupees. Then enter back in
through the North Gate. At the same time you will be stocking up on much
needed arrows and magic energy. Now that your back in the park area with 
your 70 Rupees in hand, run for and slightly to the left. Exit into 
South Clock Town.

THINGS TO FIND: Bomb Shop, Bomb Bag


Press the Z button to get the camera behind Link then run forward and to 
your right. Travel down the wooden ramp. Running forward and slightly 
left, leave South Clock Town. Your now in West Clock Town. Press the Z 
button again and run forward and left to underneath the straw roofs. You 
will see a door just past the patch of yellow flowers. This is the door 
leading into the Bomb shop. Travel over to the door and open it. Step 
inside the Bomb Shop.

Now that your inside, run over to the white table with the merchandise 
placed upon it. The shopkeeper, a frail man with pale skin will come out 
to met you. Start talking to the man. Press right on the control stick 
to highlight the cursor on the Bomb Bag. “This bag for carrying bombs is 
made from a certain monster’s stomach.” Decide the purchase and buy the 
Bomb Bag, forking over a hard-earned 50 Rupees. You now have the ability 
to store and carry 20 small bombs with you. Turn around and run back 
over to the door, exit out of the shop. You will use the other 20 rupees 
in a little bit.  Now run along and exit out of West Clock Town. Go up 
the ramp and exit out into the North lock Town, then exit back out into

THINGS TO FIND: Mountain Village


With your bombs in hand, your now ready to head up to the snowy hills 
and mountains to the north. Run forward along the marble walkway till 
you reach the starting of the snow and blue brick railing. Turn left and 
trot down the ramp you find here. Look to your right and run forward, 
making sure to avoid the Dodongo (Large). When you reach back against 
the stone here, turn right, and head up this next ramp. Your at a tiny 
snow plateau now, run to your left and climb up this last ramp to the 
area at the top.

You will notice the passageway to continue on is blocked by structures 
of ice crystals. Do not touch them, or Link will freeze himself. Walk 
close enough to the so Tatl flies out and targets something above. Press 
the Z button and you will lock onto a large icicle hanging above the 
mass of ice blocking your way. Get out your Hero’s Bow and load in an 
arrow. Fire it at the icicle. It will strike its stem and shake a little 
bit. Fire a second arrow at it and it will break. The icicle will 
plummet down and smack into the ice crystals below shattering them away. 
Put away your bow and run forward, entering into the snowy wastes.

Be careful, the traction for Link in the mountains is much less. Run 
forward along this patch of slick ground. The snow will start to get 
thick and Link will leave footprints behind him. Head down between the 
pine tree and snow boulder. Kill the Blue Tektite then pops out of the
snow and forward to the back wall here. Turn to the left and travel up 
the dirt incline. Once your at the snow area at the top, kill the Blue 
Tektite here. Turn right and run up to the snow boulders. A wall of them
is blocking you from continuing on. 

Tatl is worried “This is no good! If we could just blast these snowballs 
out of the way, we could get through!” Set your just-brought Bombs to a 
C-button and stand next to the wall of snow boulders. Place and a bomb 
down and then run back, or else you will lose a half of a heart in 
health. It will fizzle and flash a little. Then explode, causing the 
boulders to blast apart in shards. Trot forward through the new opening.

Run up to the rock ledges and jump up this set of three. Go towards the 
tree and kill of another Blue Tektite hiding in the snow. Jump up this 
set of two ledges. Traveling towards the sign, kill off yet another Blue 
Tektite. The sign reads off as “Mountain Village ahead. Beware of 
blizzards and deep snow. Gorons should be able to break the snow 
boulders easily.” Run past the tree you see just up ahead and turn left. 
Run up the snow incline and forward through the thick snow, exiting out. 
You’re now in Mountain Village.

THINGS TO FIND: Map of Snowhead, Goron Village


It is very silent, windswept and barren. There isn’t many Gorons about. 
Head forward through the snow and towards the large tree. From there you 
should see a frozen creek leading up to a small wooden bridge. Run along 
the creek bank till you reach the bridge, then cross over it. Just ahead 
will be an owl statue resting near a snowed wall. Go over and activate 
it with your sword. While facing it, turn to your right and forward. Go 
past the large snowball you see and towards the two trees ahead in the 
distance. Pass between them, trotting down the side of the snow dune. 
Head to the two snowballs in front of you and go past. You will see 
another sign here. “Goron Village ahead. Beware of the White Wolfos.” 
Enter into this new area.

This new area leads up to the Goron Village. Trot along forward through 
the snow. Kill the Blue Tektite you find and continue forward and to the 
right. You will see a rope-and-plank bridge crossing over some frozen 
water below. Run across it to a small snow island. A White Wolfos will 
pop out of the snow here. Kill it off and continue and cross this next 
bridge. On this tiny snow island, get out your bow and load in an arrow. 
Aim up in the air, and you will see Tinkle the Map salesman floating on 
a red balloon. Pop it with the arrow, Tinkle falling down to the ground 
in the process. Go over and talk to Tinkle and buy a Map of Snowhead for 
20 rupees. 

Turn away from Tinkle and continue on. Run over the short rope-and-plank 
bridge in front of you to the next island. Go around the ice crystal 
formation in the center and another White Wolfos will pop out. Ignore 
this one and ascend the bridge. Run into the passageway.

THINGS TO FIND: Lens of Truth, Goron Ghost


Your now in the Goron Village. The platform your start off on is very 
slick and Link will slide around a lot. Turn to your right and run 
towards the corner here. Slide down the ice ramp to the snow down below.
Run across the snow towards the Deku Scrub salesman up ahead and go past
him, heading towards the large snowball. Keep running till you reach the
wooden railing and run along it. You will come upon two stone pillars 
and a gap in the railing leading into an apparently large chasm. Perched
up on one of the pillars is a large owl, your friend from Southern Swamp
is back. Run over to him and he begin speaking with you. 

“Hoo-Hoot! We meet again, fairy child!” He tells you that the road ahead 
is even more challenging, and that you must proceed with courage. The 
owl will tell you to seek the treasure in shrine across the chasm here. 
“Do not be daunted by appearances.” He will then take flight into the 
air. Run to the wooden boards at the edge to the huge chasm. Flying 
across the pit, he will drop feathers along his path as flaps his wings. 
You must be quick about this. Wait until the feathers appear to have 
landed and are “floating” above the large chasm. There are actually on 
the top of invisible platforms. Follow the trail of “floating” feathers 
and jump along the string of platforms. Be careful, there very slick. 
Then jump over to the ledge of land in front of a cave opening. The owl 
congratulates you and tells you that a object that will help you is 
located inside the cave. “Use that item when returning from here.” He
then flies away into the sky. Run forward and enter into the shrine. 

The shrine is nothing more then a small circular cavern. A large 
treasure chest is located at the center of it, bathed in a stream of 
sunlight. Three brown boulders encircle it. Run forward and pass to the 
right of the small patch of scrubs. Go over and open the treasure chest. 
“You got the Lens of Truth! Gaze through it to see mysteries that are
invisible to the naked eye.” Now turn around and exit the shrine. 

Now set your Lens of Truth to a C-button. Look out at the empty 
appearing chasm. Use the Lens of Truth and a string of ice platforms 
will now appear before you. Keep looking through it and run off the edge 
of the snow, hopping along the chain of ice platforms. Jump back to the
wooden ledge. Look slightly to the left. You will now see a before 
invisible ghost in sight, floating up and down. He is bulky and gray, 
resembling a Goron. 

Keep looking through you Lens of Truth and go over and talk to the Goron 
Ghost. “... ... ...Can it be? Are you able to see me?” Now you must 
prove you can see him by following behind. The Goron Ghost will start to 
float away from you. Turn off your Lens of Truth to save magic energy, 
and follow his shadow. It will be a moving black dot. He will cruise up 
some ice ramps and pause all the way up at the place you first entered 
from to Goron Village. Turn your Lens of Truth back on so he knows you 
have followed him and he will float out, follow behind.

THINGS TO FIND: Goron Graveyard


Your back inside the area with the bridges. Run down to the end of this 
first rope-and-plank bridge and turn on your Lens of Truth again. The 
Goron Ghost will float off. Follow behind him, crossing the bridges. 
Ignore any White Wolfos along the way. The Goron Ghost will pause for a 
third time at the entrance back to the Mountain Village. Do the usual 
response and turn on your Lens of Truth. He will float out of the area, 
follow and exit behind him.
 
Your back at the Mountain Village again. Turn on your Lens of Truth. The 
Goron Ghost will be up ahead past the large snowball. Run up to him, he 
will again float away. This time, over towards a small lake will flattop 
icebergs floating in it. He will then glide up the side of the ice cliff 
face. Turn off your Lens of Truth and run over to the edge of the lake. 
Go to the left side of the sign, and face the lake. You will see a large 
iceberg will a smaller one orbiting around it. Wait for it, then jump 
over on top of the small one. It will continue around. When your in 
range, jump diagonally to the right to the non-moving iceberg here. Jump 
to the other shore. Turn on your Lens of Truth and a steel ladder will 
come into view. Climb up the ladder to follow the Goron Ghost.  
 
     
                          Follow this diagram to ascend the side of the
                          rock face. The ladder system is invisible, so 
               [TOP]      keep your Lens of Truth on. But only use it

You should have climbed up the ladder maze and be at the top of the 
cliff. It is obviously very cold, for a Goron is frozen solid in ice and 
his friend is shivering, just ahead of you. Make sure your Lens of Truth 
is on and run towards the Goron Ghost. He is waiting for you at the 
corridor entrance here. The Ghost will fly in, follow behind.

THINGS TO FIND: Goron Mask, hot spring 


This is the Goron Graveyard. Purple spike pillars litter the warm cave. 
Blue-flame torches flicker along the cave ceiling. There is a single 
gravestone in the center of the cavern, engulfed in a pillar of 
sunlight. Turn on your Lens of Truth and run across the sand to the 
gravestone. The Goron Ghost will be waiting for you, floating in front 
of it. Talk to the ghastly being. He says that “The soaring one said the 
one who could see me would be arriving soon...” He tells you that he is 
Darmani the Third, and is unfortunately, no longer alive. Darmani is a 
renowned warrior and veteran, but he was killed when he went of to 
Snowhead Temple to drive away a demon. The blizzards blew him into the 
deep gorges surrounding the temple. Darmani complains that although he 
has died, he cannot rest. You must now heal his sorrows.

Get out your Ocarina of Time and play the Song of Healing on it. Darmani 
holds his head, rocking back and forth. His sorrows are melting into the 
song now. A dream sequence ensues showing a large mob of Gorons cheering 
on Darmani. In a flash of blackness, a mask that looks like the face of 
a Goron falls from the gravestone to Link’s feet. “You got the Goron 
Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!”

Now that you have a Goron Mask, set it to a C-button. Put it on, and 
Link will turn into a large Goron. This form is Link is very powerful, 
but slow and cumbersome and can’t swim in water. Run around the purple 
spike pillar to the back of the gravestone. Walk right up to the back, 
so your touching it and the “grab” will be displayed on the action icon. 
Pull the gravestone as far back as it can go. Moving the gravestone 
reveals a small vent in the floor. Now that is uncovered, steam will 
escape from it and hot water will rise up and blanket the floor of the 
grave site to create a hot spring.

You must now find the Crying Goron baby. Turn back into human Link. Run 
around the gravestone and forward. Wade out of the water, cross the 
brown sand and exit out of the Goron Graveyard.

When you’re back outside in the Mountain Village, run forward across the 
snow and leap of the edge. Link will plummet down to the water below. 
Make sure to aim where he lands, or else you could get serious impact 
damage from landing on an iceberg. Swim in the water and grab the ledge. 
Pull yourself up onto shore, putting on your Goron Mask. Take Goron Link 
and curl up into a ball. Roll to your left and skid across the snow and 
exit out.

You’re back in the area where you purchased the Map of Snowhead from 
Tinkle. Curl up into a ball again and roll forward and slightly to the 
right. Go to the right side, of the start of the first bridge and roll 
off the edge. Roll along the frozen water on the bottom here and towards 
the third island, the one with the large ice crystal on it. Skid up the 
incline to the top of it and uncurl yourself. Running around to the 
right of the ice crystal, ignore the White Wolfos that pops out. Go 
across the bridge and enter into the corridor.

THINGS TO FIND: Goron Shrine, Crying Baby Goron


Walk straight forward across the ice and fall off the ledge. Trot across 
the snow below, along the side of the building. You will see a stone 
door, imprinted with the image of two Gorons holding up Bomb Flowers 
above there heads. The sign beside the door reads, “Goron Shrine Please 
see the gatekeeper above.” Take matters into your own hands and stand 
before the door. Curl up into a ball using the A button, then press B to 
pound the ground. The stone door will raise up, exposing the entrance to 
the Goron Shrine. Walk on inside the sanctuary from the cold.
 
The shrine is a large cylindrical room, two stories in height. All the 
Gorons are holding there heads in agony. The nauseating sound of a baby 
crying fills the air. If you talk to any of the Gorons, they will 
welcome you back and that “The Goron Elder’s son wouldn’t stop crying.”
Run forward and out of the corridor. Turn to you left and trot up the 
winding dirt trail to the top. Some stone pillars are here, and a Goron 
holding his head. Walk over to the stripe of red carpet. The sound of 
crying has gotten much louder now. Walk along it and enter into the 
passageway.

You will come out in a small room. Two Gorons are holding there heads 
and along the back wall is a bed with a Goron baby sitting upright in it 
crying rivers of tears. Walk over and talk to the crying child. He will 
stop crying for a moment to speak with you. He misses his “daddy” and is 
very cold. Finish speaking with him and turn around. Run forward a 
little bit, and get out your Goron Drums. Play the Song of Soaring and
warp to the statue in Mountain Village.

THINGS TO FIND: Goron Graveyard (again)


Remove your Goron mask, changing back into human Link. Since you have 
found the Crying Baby, you now need to find his father. Run to the right 
of the owl statue, towards the large snowball. Go past it and wait at 
the lake bank. Cross the flat-top icebergs again. Facing towards the 
lake, notice the large iceberg to the left of the sign. It will have a 
smaller iceberg orbiting around it. Wait for the small one to get into 
range, then jump to it. Now wait for it to circle around, jump diagonal 
to the right, to the stationary iceberg closest to the other ledge. Jump 
over to the snow ledge. Climb the ladders again. If you need help once 
more, look at the “Ladder Diagram” in the previous section. When you get 
to the top run to the left of the two Gorons and enter the graveyard.

Run forward across the sand and to the edge of the Hot Spring. Equip 
your empty bottle to a C-button and wade into the water so it is knee-
deep. Scoop up a sample of Hot Spring water, now you must hurry. The 
water will cool off and then be useless for melting ice. Time is crucial 
now. Turn around and run forward, wading out of the water, cross the 
brown sand and exit out of the Goron Graveyard.

THINGS TO FIND: Daddy Goron, Lullaby Intro, Goron Village (third time)


Immediately, run forward across the snow and leap off the ledge. Link 
will fall the great distance below and into the water. As quick as you 
can, swim over to the shore. Place on your Goron Mask and then curl up 
into a ball. Roll along the snow to your left, exit out of the Mountain 
Village. Your back in the area with Tinkle, the map salesman again. Curl
up into a ball and roll along the snow. Go forward and slightly to the
right of the beginning of the first bridge. Fall down here and keep
rolling. Roll along the frozen bottom towards the third island, the one
with ice crystal on the top of it. Roll up the incline and stop to
uncurl at the top. Ignore the White Wolfos again, and go around the left
side of the ice crystal to the tree. Walk down the side here and you
will find a large snowball. 

Tatl glows green over it, making it suspicious. Walk up to the snowball 
and do a Goron Punch. The snowball will shatter, revealing a elderly, 
hunchback Goron frozen in a block of ice. This is the crying baby’s 
father. Walk right up next to the ice crystal and pour the bottle of Hot 
Spring Water on it. The ice will melt in a surge of steam, causing the 
old Goron to come back to life. 

Talk to the Elder Goron. He will comment on how late it is and that he 
must really get going. Finish speaking with him and he will start to 
trot away. Walk with him, and start speaking again. He will say it is no 
use following him, and that you, Darmani are supposed to be dead. 
However, since you met up with his son, he becomes worried that he is 
still crying from him being gone. The Elderly Goron no longer cares what 
you are, only that you need to help his son fall asleep. He gets out a 
small hand drum and places it on the snow in front of him. He struggles 
to remember all of the Goron Lullaby, but only plays you the first six 
notes. Repeat the notes on your Goron Drums. “You learned the beginning! 
Lullaby Intro!” Good job! Now you must head back to the crying child, he 
is counting on you. 

Finish speaking with the Elder Goron and turn away. Curl up into
a ball, rolling up the incline of the third island at the tree on top.
From there, uncurl yourself and turn left. Head up the rope-and-plank
bridge and exit out through the corridor.

THINGS TO FIND: Crying Baby Goron (again), Goron Lullaby 


Your back in the Goron Village for a third time, and the last. Thank you 
God... Walk forward along the ice and fall down from the edge. At the 
bottom, trot along the snow to reach the Goron Shrine door again. Open 
it with a Goron stomp and walk on in. Head along the winding stone path 
on your left to the top and enter the chamber with the crying baby. He 
is once again, still sobbing away. Walk up to the crying baby and get 
out your Goron Drums. Play the Lullaby Intro. The child stops crying for 
a moment, pausing to say its the song “daddy” used to always play. 
Standing up in the bed, he yells the next part of the song for you. A 
cinema scene starts to play.

It shows the screen in all white and the Elder Goron rocking the baby
back and forth. The Goron baby says its like “daddy” is right there with
him. He curls up, falling asleep. “The Lullaby Intro became the Goron
Lullaby... This lullaby blankets listeners in calm while making eyelids
grow heavy.” Lucky for you, the song is very potent and the other two
Gorons in the room also fall asleep. You are now ready to take on
Snowhead. About time too. I really hate getting that Goron Lullaby, but 
Snowhead is fun, so it’s well worth it. Get out your Goron Drums and 
play the Song of Soaring. Warp to the owl statue in Mountain Village.

THINGS TO FIND: Snowhead


When you arrive back at the owl statue, turn to your left. Run forward 
past the snowball here. You will see a exit with a sign. “This way to 
Snowhead. Beware of the slippery valley trail and the giant falling 
snowballs.” Turn to the right and run in the gap between the rock faces. 
Trot up this steep snow trail, exiting out.          

Run forward along the snow, slightly left. Head up towards the single 
tree with the sign next to it. Facing the sign, turn to your left and 
you will see a pit with wooden ramps on either side. Snowballs from the 
nearby wall trickle into the pit. Curl up into a ball and start to roll 
forward towards the wooden ramp on your side. Goron Link with screech 
from the lack of traction and begin to glow red. He when then shoot out 
spikes from his body and rapidly roll forward, sailing up the ramp and 
over the gap. This, the Goron Roll, consumes magic energy with its use. 
Land on the other side and break the snowball. Stop your Goron Roll and 
collect the Magic Jar that has been exposed. If you fall off this ledge 
near you, you will have to start over. 

Use your Goron Punch to destroy any snowballs that so that you wouldn’t 
get injured. Run forward along the snow ledge. Make sure to stick close 
to rock face. Round the corner to your left, then right. Head up the 
incline and you will see a second gap. Run up to the ramp on your side, 
punching the snowball in the way. Backtrack a few paces and curl up into 
a ball. Start the roll forward until you glow red and shoot out spikes. 
Rolling forward, travel up the ramp and jump the gap. Land on the other 
side and keep rolling forward. Go to the left of the first tree, right 
of the second, left of the third. Keep rolling and exit out.

THINGS TO FIND: Snowhead Temple 


Your now in Snowhead... finally!!! A few scenes show a snow trail and 
red flags which gorges on either side, leading to a cylindrical tower of
shimmering ice. This would be Snowhead Temple. Turn back into normal
Link and run forward and to the right. Activate the owl statue here.
Getting out your Ocarina of Time, play the Song of Time and warp back to
the dawn of the first day. 

When your back at the Clock Tower entrance, get out your Ocarina of Time 
again. Play the Inverted Song of Time to slow down the flow of the 
minutes. Go stock up on arrows, bombs and magic energy by cutting down 
the scrubs in Termina Field. You can exit through the North Gate, but 
make sure to cut down the scrubs in a clockwise direction as you travel 
so bombs are easier to get. When you have a plentiful supply of the 
mentioned things, get out your Ocarina a third time and this time, play 
the Song of Soaring. Warp over to the owl statue in Snowhead.

You now have three full days of slowed time to beat Snowhead Temple. 
After arriving back at Snowhead, turn back into Goron Link. Equip your 
Lens of Truth and look to the right, towards the temple. You will see a 
huge Goron come into view, huffing and puffing will all his breathe. 
This is what caused the blizzards that killed Darmani. It is also 
preventing access to the temple complex. Put away your Lens of Truth and 
get out your Goron Drums. Facing towards the once-again invisible Goron, 
play the Goron Lullaby. The large Goron will moan loudly and curl up 
into a ball. He is fast asleep and tips of the platform side into the 
large gorge. 

Run forward past the three small snowballs and along the narrow ice 
catwalk. Head to the first red flag and go past it. Continuing on to the 
second red flag, the path gets narrow enough only to accommodate the 
width of your body. Punch any snowballs in your way run forward then 
left. Pause a few paces before the incline where the Goron once stood. 
Curl into a ball and start rolling up the incline. Keep rolling, going 
left past the snowballs and stop at the start of the ramp you find here. 
Walk up the ramp and run along it. The ramp spirals up and around the 
outside of the temple. Watch for any snowballs that may roll towards you
and quickly dispatch of them. At the end of the ramp, turn right and 
enter into Snowhead Temple. This one’s fun.

COMPLETE MAP OF SNOWHEAD TEMPLE

This map is only a bonus aide to you. The walkthrough I have written is 
self-sufficient, but I decided to make this map so you may better see 
the inner workings of Snowhead Temple. Since this map is a bit more 
complex, I recommend printing it out. Remember, if you see a letter in 
(), there was no room and continues where you find the other matching 
letter in the ().

Legend:
@ - Stairs
==========
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are now in the second temple of the game, Snowhead Temple. This is 
the first chamber of it, a small room with three curved ice pieces on 
either side of you. A large granite block with the icon of Majora’s Mask 
is ahead, blocked with icicles. The ere tune of a piano and wind gusts 
will begin to play. Take of your Goron Mask and turn back into normal 
link. Six White Boes will appear behind each of the ice pieces. Kill 
them off and run forward over to the granite block. Slash the icicles in 
front of it, exposing it to be pushed. Tatl tells you “Hmm...this is 
kind of big...” and that you will need more then your normal strength to 
move it. Put your Goron Mask back on. Run forward up to the block and 
press forward. After three pushes from you, the brick corridor will be 
clear and the block will fall into a small hole. Run over the top of the 
block and enter the second small chamber.

Just ahead of you, is a door frozen solid in ice. To your left, is a 
door requiring a Silver Key to open, and to your right is a accessible 
door with a ceramic pot on either side. A White Wolfos will appear at 
the center of the room. Ignore it and run to the right and open the 
accessible door. 

You exit out into a large oblong room. Frezzard enemies blow streams of 
ice frost and a severed wooden bridge stretches across the center of the 
room. Lava pits dot the ground down below. Run forward across the strip 
of ground on your side and stop at the beginning of the bridge. Tatl 
tells you that you should jump the gap in the bridge. Back up against 
the wall and face towards the bridge using the Z button. Curl up into a 
ball and wait. Wait until the Frezzard closest to you just begins to 
blow his frost, then start rolling forward. You will screech on the 
slick ground and glow red then roll partly across the bridge, then 
shooting spikes from your body. 

Continue rolling and jump the gap. Land on the other side and keep 
rolling to hit the wooden crate. It will stop your roll. Now take off 
your Goron Mask. As normal Link, run to the left and jump over the pit 
to the stone ledge. Trot up the stairs. This room is on the second 
floor. You will spot a Real Bombchu near the back of the room. Turn and 
run to the left. In the corner, will be a wooden treasure chest. Open it 
up and “You got the Dungeon Map!” Turn to your left and run over and 
exit back down the stairs. 

When your back in the room, run forward and jump over the gap. On the 
other side turn to your right and look over. You will see a door with a 
blue door frame. Trot forward over to it and open and walk in. Your in 
the central room of Snowhead Temple, it extends on all floors of the 
complex. A few scenes play showing the challenges that await for you. 
Run forward across the curved piece of ground, then across the stone 
piece. When you reach the other side, run across this section of ground 
and to the door with the red door frame. Open it and walk on in.

This chamber has a patch of snow covering the center of it. Turn to your 
left and you will see two granite blocks with Majora Mask icons on them. 
They are stacked upon one another. Walk over to the front of them and 
grab a hold. Pull them towards yourself two times and run around the 
block stack. Moving the blocks uncovered the entrance to a small room, 
containing a treasure chest. Enter in and walk to the treasure chest in 
the center of the room. Open it up and you now have your first Silver 
Key. Turn and exit out of the small room. Run to the left of the block 
stack and run back over to the door you entered from. Exit out of it 
back into the central chamber. 

Turn to your right and run along the wall here till you reach the end. 
You will see a door frozen over in ice and a lit torch on either side of 
it. Facing the torch, get right up against the wall. Equip your Hero’s 
Bow on a C-Button and load in an arrow. Aim it at the torch, firing an 
arrow so it travels through the torch flame and strikes the ice. It will 
melt away in a puff of steam and clear the ice blockage on the door. 
Walk around the torch and over to the door. Open it up.

Enter into the chamber. This is the same chamber you entered right when 
you began playing the temple. A White Wolfos will appear once again, 
ignore it. Turn and run to the right, over to the locked door. Open it 
up and the lock and chains will disappear, using up the Silver Key you 
just got. Enter through it.

You come out into a large room, elongated room. Ice covers are large 
portion of the center of it. Forward and to your right you should see a 
large ice crystal. Look carefully and you will see a White Wolfos hiding 
out behind it waiting to pounce on you. Run forward and a few paces 
across the ice. The White Wolfos will run out from behind the ice 
crystal and attack. Just stay stationary, the ice will cause the White 
Wolfos to lose any real traction when attacking. Kill it off then 
continue forward. Run ahead to the treasure chest you see. Open it up 
and you will get the Compass for Snowhead Temple. Turn to your left and 
on the back wall will be a section of brick wall with hairline fractures 
covering it. 

Walk towards the wall, but pause a few paces before it. A second White 
Wolfos will come out to attack you from your left. Kill it off and turn 
your attention back to the section of weak wall. Walking up to it, equip 
your Bombs on a C-button. Place a bomb in front of the wall section and 
run back a few paces. After a few seconds the bomb will explode, getting 
rid of the wall. Uncovered is a staircase leading up to the next floor. 
Run forward and trot up the spiraling stairs.

You come out in a small cavernous chamber. Many stone pillars dot the 
room, with ice crystals formed on the top of them. Trot forward a few 
paces. Get out your Hero’s Bow and load in an arrow. Aim up at the  
ceiling. You will see a multitude of icicles hanging up there. Tatl 
glows green next to one of them. Aim, and shoot it with a arrow. Wait a 
few seconds, then shoot it with a second one. The attachment will snap, 
causing the icicle to fall down, and smash one of the ice crystals on 
top of one of the pillars. This pillar is free to use as a platform to
jump to now. Load in another arrow and aim at the icicle right behind
where the previous one was. Shoot it down as well, destroying another
ice crystal below. But away your Hero’s Bow. Run forward towards the
large pillar with no ice crystal on top of it. Go past and to the left
of it and you will see a stone ledge. 

Trot over to it, climbing up on top. Turn yourself around and look off 
the ledge. Hop over to the top of the yellow stone pillar you see. 
Turning slightly right, jump over to the slightly higher pink stone 
pillar. Make sure to land on the left edge of this one, because a 
renegade icicle will fall from the ceiling and hit you if you don’t. 
Look to your right and jump to the final and highest pillar, grabbing 
onto the edge of it. Pull yourself up on top and hop over to the 
plateau. A large snowball and a few smaller ones are sitting here. Put 
on your Goron Mask, transforming. 

Walk over to the large snowball and give it a Goron Punch. It will 
shatter revealing another treasure chest. Go over and kick it open. You 
have gotten your second Silver Key. Now, turn to your left and walk off 
the edge of the plateau. Run towards the back wall where a locked door 
is located. Open it up, and the chain and locks will disappear at the 
price of your just-earned Silver Key. Enter through.

This is the infamous Goron Switch Room, so listen carefully. Run forward 
along the dirt going on the higher right path. When you reach the end, 
you will find a yellow switch. Using a Goron Pound by pressing the A and 
B buttons, compress it. A yellow column and exit block will pop up as a 
result. Remove you Goron Mask. Hope over to the newly-raised yellow 
column then run to the opposite bank. Put your Goron Mask back on now. 
Run to your left over to the green switch and Goron Pound it down. This 
will cause a green column to rise on the lower level. Retrace your steps 
back and pound the yellow column you used to cross earlier. This will 
cause you to go to a lower level, but clear the blockage of the exit 
door. Run over to the previously-raised green column and take off your 
Goron Mask. Make sure to remove it right before you hop up, or the swarm 
of White Boes will knock you down. Hop on top of it, then hop to the 
higher level. Run over to the door and exit out of the chamber. 

Here is a recap for you:

Goron Switch Room.
A. Pound the yellow switch
B. Pound the green switch
C. Pound the yellow column
D. Hop to the green column
E. Reach the exit door in time

Your back in the central chamber, this part of it is just composed of 
four ramps and little area. There is very slick ice on the surfaces of 
the platform ramps, making Goron rolls easy to accomplish. Put on your 
Goron Mask and transform yourself. Curl up into a roll and align 
yourself with the thin platform. Rolling forward, you will begin to glow
red from lack of any traction. You will shoot spikes, rolling forward 
rapidly and flying up the small ramp at the end. Jump across the gap and
land on the thin platform on the other side. Keep rolling forward till 
you hit the large ice crystal at the end and then stop and uncurl. This
ice is prohibiting access to the stairwell behind it. Facing the ice
formation, turn to your right. 

You will find a embankment of snow curved along the wall. Walk right up 
to the edge of the snow, curl up into a ball and roll gently forward. 
Roll and curve along with the snow embankment to the end. If you bump 
into the wall and fall off the snow, you will have to go back and try to 
roll along it again. When you reach the end you will be in a small area, 
the floor caked in light snow. A door leading off to another room is to 
your left and a torch flickers a little bit in the distance. Facing the 
torch, turn to your left and you will see a second set of thin platforms 
perpendicular to the first pair. Curl up into a ball again and start to 
roll forward. Heat yourself up and shoot spikes. Roll along the thin 
platform, launching into the air from the ramp at the end. Jump the gap 
and land on the other side, but stop your roll mid-platform.

Trot forward the rest of the platform to the end. Here is a small alcove 
with a few small snowballs and a door with a vine-engraved door frame. 
Punch the snowballs and gather the gifts the leave. Now take off your 
Goron Mask and make sure to have your Hero’s Bow set to a C-button. Walk 
over to the door, open it and go inside.
 
You enter into a large square room. Bars slide over the door behind you, 
locking it shut. All of a sudden, in the upper left hand corner of the 
room, an old man bearing a staff appears in a energy beam. Boss music 
begins to play. Give Wizrobe a few good smacks around. To see how to 
defeat Wizrobe, see the boss section of this document. After you have 
pelted him with enough arrows, he will disappear in a puff of green 
flame. The bars will raise from the door unlocking it, and a chest will 
materialize at the center of the room. Go over and open it. You have 
just earned the Fire Arrow upgrade. When you use it, this will upgrade 
your normal arrows. Basically, when using them, your bow will shoot 
plain arrows with flaming tips. This allows you to melt ice without 
using the cumbersome hot water. Now get out your Ocarina of Time. Play 
the Song of Soaring and warp back to the temple entrance. You are not 
done yet.

Your back at the entrance to the temple. Run forward across the room 
over to the icicles again. Chop them down with your sword. Run into the 
next room and another White Wolfos will pop out. Ignore it and keep 
running straight. Exit out of the door with the red door frame. 

Now that your back in the central chamber, turn left and run along the 
wall. Keep running till you reach a fork in the paths right before the 
door with the yellow door frame, and turn right. Trot across the 
concrete slab and keep running forward. Exit out of the door with the 
blue door frame. 

This room is another you were in earlier, except now you have the Fire 
Arrows. Turn left and you will see a small stone ledge running along the 
wall, with a Freezard sitting there. Equip your Hero’s Bow with the Fire 
Arrow upgrade. Load in a flaming arrow and aim it straight at the 
Freezard and then shoot it off. The Freezard with melt away in a puddle 
of water. Still looking through you Hero’s Bow, turn left and across the 
room with be another Freezard. Melt that one away as well. Put away your 
Hero’s Bow and run forward a few paces along the stone ledge. Stop and 
get out your Hero’s Bow again. Melt the large block of ice in front of 
you. Then melt the last Freezard enemy behind it. A chest will appear at 
the end of the ledge. Run down to it and open the chest. Good job! You 
have gotten your second Silver Key. Turn to your left and run back down 
along the ledge. Exit back out into the central chamber.
 
This time, right away, run to your right. Exit down the staircase you 
find here. This is the Temple Basement. They didn’t even bother to pave 
the floor, leaving it as hardened soil. Travel forward towards the large
pillar at the center of the room then go around the left side of it. A
lava pit will be to your left. Two Red Bubbles will fly out but ignore
them. Keep trotting forward along the dirt floor to the back wall and
exit out of the door.
 
You will immediately here the howl of Freezards blowing off frost. Turn 
and run right, down the hallway. Large stone columns will loom up. A 
golden colored Deku Flower will be frozen in a block of ice to your 
left. Melt the ice away with a Fire Arrow then equip your Deku Scrub 
Mask. Put it on and transform yourself. Run over and stand on top of the 
Deku Flower. Turning to your left, face the wall with the three ceramic 
pots along it. Dive down into the flower and shoot yourself out.
Flowercopter forward and land on the ledge you see sticking out. There 
is another gold colored Deku Flower here. 

Stand on it facing the wall, then turn to your left. Dive down into this 
second flower and shoot out. Glide forward and land on the stone area. 
Remove your Deku Mask and turn around. Looking out into the room, press 
the Z button and you will notice three unlit torches. One a bit in front 
of you, the second at the back of the room, and the third a ways to your 
right. Use your fire arrows and light all three torches. Make sure to 
aim so it grazes the top of the torch. When all three have been lit, the 
bars on a door to your right will be raising, allowing access through 
it. There is also a Freezard near the door, the closest one to you. 
Dispatch it permanently with a fire arrow, then hop along the pillar 
tops to where it once was. Run forward and enter through the door.
 
Your back in the central chamber, except in a small caged-off area with 
a Goron Switch. Equip your Goron Mask and wear it. Hop on top of the 
switch then use a Goron Pound. A scene will play showing a massive 
pillar raise from the basement along the entire floors of Snowhead 
Temple. Remove your Goron Mask and get out your Ocarina of Time. Play 
the Song of Soaring and warp back to the temple entrance. 

Run forward across the room and chop down the icicles again. Head 
through the corridor into the next room, then turn to your right and 
exit out of the door. Put back on your Goron Mask and trot along the 
slick floor to the foot of the ramp. Turn and face the ramp, curl 
yourself up in a ball and roll forward. You will glow red then shoot 
spikes while you roll. Go along the ramp, and jump the gap and land on 
the other side. Keep rolling and let the wooden crate break your roll 
again. Remove your Goron Mask. Turn left and run along the path over to 
the door. Break the pots next to it and collect the needed magic energy, 
then backtrack a few paces. Jump off the edge here over to the other 
ledge and walk up the staircase. 

This is the room where you first got the Dungeon Map. Travel forward a 
few paces then hop up on top of the raised platform. Get out your Hero’s 
Bow and load in a fire arrow. Aim upwards at the top area of the room. 
You should see a stone ledge with a Freezard sitting on it. Aim at the 
Freezard and shoot the arrow, melting it away. When the Freezard has 
been cleared, it will uncover a golden eye frozen in a piece of ice. 
Load in another fire arrow and aim at the eye. Shoot the arrow. It will 
strike the ice, melting it, then cause the eye to shut. The platform you 
are standing on will raise up one level. Turn to your right and hop over 
to the tile floor. Run forward and over to the door. Exit out.

Now on the same floor in which you got your fire arrows, the difference 
being the pillar is raised though the center of it. Turn to your right 
and run off the ledge, making sure to fall down on the wire-floor area a 
few feet below. Run and curve along the floor to the end. Climb up the 
metal ladder you find and at the top turn to your right. There is a 
staircase blocked off by a large crystal of ice. Get out your Hero’s Bow 
and load in a fire arrow. Aim it at the ice and let it loose. The ice 
will melt clearing out the corridor. Run forward and trot up the 
staircase to the next floor.

You come out on a small area with a flickering torch. Put on your Goron 
Mask and turn to the right. You will see another stretch of snow to roll 
along. However, if you fall off there is no screen to catch you. Curl up 
and gently roll forward along the snow. Curve with it and roll to the 
end. Uncurl at the end. This is another small area with a torch and a 
locked door. Walk over to the door and open it. The chains and lock with 
retract, but also use up the silver key you got from frying the 
Freezards. Enter through. 

This room is covered in thick snow and swarming with Eeno monsters. Turn 
right when you first enter and run along the wall. Go past the first 
stone pillar and keep running. Hide behind the second pillar. This will 
shield you from the snowballs be hurled at you by the Eenos. Remove your 
Goron Mask and get out your Hero’s Bow. Load in a fire arrow and aim 
forward. You will see a large ice chunk. Shoot the arrow and melt the 
ice. It will uncover another staircase leading upwards. Put away your 
bow and run forward. Ascend the stairs. 

Coming out in a snowless granite room, two Dinofols come out from behind 
the brick pieces to great you. Welcome them with your sword and kill 
them both off. They leave behind two temple fairies when they die, you 
can collect them if you wish to. Otherwise, head down to the far wall 
from which you entered. Go over to the door and exit out. 

Back in the center chamber, run forward along the thin marble path. 
Continue across the gray pillar-top and the thin marble path on the 
other side of it. Exit out of the door you find. Bars slide over the 
door behind you, locking you in. Wizrobe again appears in a energy tile. 
Defeat him. To see how to defeat “Wizrobe – The Return!” see the bosses 
part of this document. After Wizrobe has been taught a lesson, he will 
again run away in a puff of green flame. Don’t expect this is the last 
of him. The door you entered will unlock along with another exit door. 
Run down to that door and exit out of the room.
 
This is a small caged room with a blue treasure chest with gold 
engraving. Walk forward and open the chest. You now have the Boss Key 
from Snowhead Temple. Good job! Now only the boss remains. Turn to your
left and walk over to the door. Exit out of the cage, door locking. Turn 
left and run along the path to the intersection. Chopping down the two 
icicles, trot forward and turn right. Run along the thin path. Continue 
to the very center of the gray pillar-top and top. Turn to you right and 
walk over to the edge. Creep right up to the edge, and the camera view 
will veer above you. You should see the area with a torch and a thin 
path below. Aim yourself carefully, then jump down. Run forward and go 
down the staircase.

Place on your Goron Mask and transform. Run forward along the thin path 
up to the pillar. Tatl pipes up and tells you “Why is this the only 
pillar that’s a different color?” If you notice, the section of pillar 
right in front of you is blue in color, unlike the brown shaft. Walk 
right up to it, and do a Goron Punch. A blue section will slide out, and 
shatter. Shortening the width of the pillar. Repeat again for the second 
section. Turn around and run forward. Exit back up the stairs from where 
you came. 

Since you knocked out the two blue sections on the previous floor, you 
now have access to punch out two more blue sections of the pillar. Run 
forward past the torch and over to the pillar. Get up next to it and 
punch out only one of the blue sections. Turn around and run back at the 
torch. At the torch, turn to your right. Curl up into a ball and roll 
along the snow incline again. At the other end, uncurl and run past the 
torch here. Go along the thin path over to the pillar once more from 
this vantage point. Punch out the last blue section, shortening the 
pillar one last time. 

You now have access to another pathway blocked by the pillars previous 
height. Turn around again and run back at the torch. Turn towards the 
snow incline. You must roll again, but this time up the incline, making 
you need more inertia. Curl into a ball and make sure to get enough  
momentum on the brown ground, then roll along the snow. Stop and turn 
right at the end. Run along the path. You will see a pathway blocked by 
snowballs ahead. Run over the pillar top to the start of the pathway. 
Punch out all four snowballs, then head up the stairs. 

Excited? I hope so, you a Goron Roll’s away from the boss chamber. Curl 
up into a ball one last time, and roll forward. You will screech and 
glow red, then shoot spikes and roll forward very fast. Jump the gap and 
land on the other side. Uncurl right after you land near the Deku 
Flower. Take off your Goron Mask. Run forward over the path up to the 
icicles. Chop all four of them down. Step forward to the large door with 
the golden lock. Make sure you have your Hero’s Bow equipped with fire 
arrows. Open it up, using your Boss Key. Venture in.

Link looks around uneasily... he spots looming to the right of him, a 
four-legged beast frozen in a block of ice. This is none other the 
temple boss. Get out your Hero’s Bow and load in a fire arrow. Aim at 
the frozen boss and shoot it off. The ice slowly melts away from his 
body... It starts to shake its head, then roars up in a loud cry. The 
boss music begins to play and it gallops away, knocking you aside. This 
is Goht, Masked Mechanical Monster. 

To see how to defeat him, see the bosses section. After he is dealt the 
final blow, Goht will gallop wildly then bash into the wall of the 
chamber. Falling apart to rubble, he will leave behind a heart container 
where his corpse lay. Go to where he has fallen and collect the 
container. A few paces away will be another blue pillar of shimmering 
light. A mask floating up and down in it. Go over and walk into the 
light pillar. “You have seized Goht’s Remains!” You have freed a spirit 
that was trapped in Goht’s body when he was wearing the mask. 

             You have just gotten the second Guardian Mask.

THINGS TO FIND: Clock Town


As soon as you warp from that gray room again, you’re back in Goron 
country. Except that, the snow has melted from the mountains and it’s 
spring time! You don’t have time to enjoy it unfortunately. Get out your 
Ocarina of Time. Play the Song of Time. Saving your game and warping 
back to the dawn of the first day.

THINGS TO FIND: At least 1 arrow, full Magic Meter, Mountain Village


Immediately when you step back into Clock Town, Tatl tells you the 
quickest way to the ocean is through the west gate. However, to get to 
the ocean you must first win back your horse Epona. That’s what this 
little sidetrack section is about. Get out your Ocarina of Time and play 
the Inverted Song of Time to slow down the hours passing. Now, make sure 
to collect at least one arrow and some magic energy. You might try 
checking the bushes in Termina Field by exiting out the gate in North 
Clock Town. After you have arrows and a full Magic Meter, get out your 
Ocarina of Time. Play the Song of Soaring, then warp over to the 
Mountain Village.

Might as well set your Goron Mask to a C button, your going to be using 
it frequently. From the owl statue in front of you, head to the right. 
Pass the wooden cabin and keep going forward. Head down the narrow snowy 
pass and exit out. Put on your Goron Mask and transform into Goron Link.
Go forward and to the right of the bridge ahead. Roll down the snow ramp 
and across the ice. Roll up the hill ahead. At the top, stop rolling and 
cross the bridge. Exit into Goron Village.

THINGS TO FIND: Giant Goron, Test Powder Keg


Take off your Goron Mask and transform back into normal Link. Run 
forward and fall off the edge to the snow below. Now trot to the left, 
down through the snowy pass. At the turn you should see a large block 
off ice blocking the way to a tunnel. Get out your Hero’s Bow and load 
in a fire arrow. Shoot the ice mass and it will melt away exposing the 
cave. Run forward, hopping up the ledge into the cave. 

Run forward through the corridor falling down the ramps. At the end you 
will find a giant Goron laying on the floor. Put on your Goron Mask 
transforming back into a Goron again. Talk to the giant Goron. He tells 
you that he’s the one and only Goron that sells the Powder Keg, a very 
powerful explosive. He asks if you want one. Say “yes” to his question. 
Before you’re allowed to use Powder Kegs officially, you must first be 
certified by passing a test. “If you can destroy the boulder that blocks 
the entrance to the Goron Racetrack near here using the Power Keg I’m 
about to give you, then I’ll approve you to carry them.” 

The Goron slaps the ground with his hand, and down pops what looks like 
a brown barrel with a Goron skull and cross bones. Quickly grab the 
Power Keg, because the fuse doesn’t last that long. As you exit out the 
corridor, throw the Powder Keg up the slopes to the higher ground. Roll 
up the ramp yourself and grab the Powder Keg again. Once your at the top 
of the corridor, grab the keg and exit out into the snow. Head left, and 
up the three wooden stairs. Now run right, trotting along the ice trail. 
At the fork, take the right path. Exit out of Goron Village.

THINGS TO FIND: Blocked entrance to the Goron Racetrack 


Head forward and fall off the left side of the wooden bridge. Walk 
across the ice towards the ramp. Walk up it and pass the bridge. From 
here, toss the Powder Keg up this slope. Roll up to the keg and grab it. 
Repeat this process till you reach the top. Gently set the keg next to 
the large gray boulder. Now quickly, get back. Wait for the fuse to burn 
away. The keg will explode blowing up the boulder exposing the tunnel. 
That was easy, wasn’t it? Now, all you have to do is backtrack to the 
giant Goron in Goron Village where you got your first Powder Keg.

THINGS TO FIND: Giant Goron (again), free Powder Keg


Head back to the cave where the Giant Goron is. Talk to him a second 
time and he will apologize for putting you through such a dangerous 
test. Uh... yea whatever. “Knowing your skills, I feel fine letting you 
handle Powder Kegs on your own.” He even gives you a free Powder Keg as 
an apology! All further kegs from him cost 100 rupees. Now that you have 
a keg, press start and set it to a C button. Take off your Goron Mask 
turning back into normal Link. Pull out your Ocarina of Time, playing 
the Song of Soaring and warping back to Clock Town.

THINGS TO FIND: Termina Field


From here in Clock Town, don’t set around counting clouds. Make sure it 
is earlier then 8:00 PM on the first day. Make sure of this, or else you 
might waste your Powder Keg. If it’s later, you’re out of luck. But I 
can’t possibly see it taking anyone that long. From the Owl statue, just 
head through the town square and exit out the south gate of clock town.

THINGS TO FIND: Milk Road


I love Termina Field due to this music. From the gate here just travel 
forward walking between the wooden pillars on either side of you. At the 
end of the tunnel of pillars, head off to the right. Pass the large oak 
tree and keep running towards those two wooden towers with the string of 
flags between them in the distance. Get past the bird and exit between 
the two wooden towers.
 
                       WARNING ALERT! PLEASE READ!
 
Once you get near those wooden towers, watch out for the Takkuri!!! 
Don’t let that bird touch you or he will steal your sword, shield, or 
something valuable. That bird will try to swoop down and grab you, but 
don’t let him!

THINGS TO FIND: Gray boulder, Romani Ranch 


This is your first visit to Milk Road. Trot forward along the dirt path 
and over to your left you will see an owl statue up against the wall. 
Activate it with your sword. From here keep following the dirt path. 
Ahead you will see a lone man trying to destroy an utterly gigantic 
boulder using a puny pick. This boulder is blocking your access to 
Romani Ranch. Luckily, you have a Powder Keg. Put on your Goron Mask to 
transform, then get out the keg. Run over next to the boulder and set 
down the Powder Keg beside it. The man will run back, and you should do 
the same. Wait for the fuse to run out and to explode. Remove your Goron 
Mask to transform back into Link. Enter through the newly opened passage 
to Romani Ranch.

THINGS TO FIND: Romani the rancher, Epona the Horse, Epona’s Song, 
maximum amount of arrows, Romani Milk, your second Bottle


Cha-ching! A nice cinema scene opens up to show Romani Ranch. Run ahead 
along the dirt road passing under the entrance gate. Keep following this 
dirt path until some cabins appear off to your right. Get off the road 
and run towards the cabin. When you get close enough to the one with the 
smoking chimney, Tatl will pipe in. “L-Look!! Isn’t that your horse?!?”

Link runs over to the cage and looks at Epona just standing in it. You 
want your horse back, do you not? Turn around and you will see a wooden 
crate with a red balloon thing floating on it. Nearby is a girl with red 
hair. (Same girl who was Malon in the Ocarina of Time) Go over and talk 
to her. She will ask you who you are, and that she is Romani, named 
after the ranch. Just tell Romani your name, whatever name you entered 
at the beginning when you chose your game. Romani will instead call you 
Grasshopper. This is due to the green clothes that you’re wearing and 
the way you patter when you walk.

Romani then speaks seriously. “Romani was practicing... For tonight... 
Tonight... They are coming...” The screen now goes into a cinema scene. 
“They... They come at night... every year when the carnival approaches.” 
The funniest line is when “And then... The come to the barn...” and it 
shows a cow being abducted. After the scene wraps up, Romani tells you 
that she is looking for a partner to get rid of these ghosts. Say “yes” 
when she asks if you want to practice. All you have to do now is shoot 
10 ghost-shaped balloons. You have unlimited arrows, and 2 minutes to do 
it. Meaning, this is extremely easy. The screen fades out. Then back in 
with you on Epona the horse! I guess you get her back huh? Now just ride 
around on Epona shooting all the balloons with arrows. The balloons can 
be scattered around anywhere in the field. So very easy... 

After your finished shooting all 10 balloons, Romani will compliment on 
how well you and Epona work together. She then teaches you Epona’s Song. 
“The song of two who are bound by trust.” You can use this song anytime 
in Termina Field to call Epona over to you. No more running around all 
slow in the field anymore. 

After learning Epona’s Song, Romani tells you that the ghosts only come 
at night, and flee at the first sight of the sun. You must keep them 
from getting in the barn or else we lose. The operation starts at 2:00 
AM in the morning. Finish speaking with Romani. Technically, this 
section is optional, but I included in the walkthrough because you 
should at least have two bottles before heading off to the ocean. You’ll 
see why very shortly. 

Firstly, make sure to go around the ranch chopping down bushes to get as 
many arrows as you can carry. When you have that done, get out your 
Ocarina of Time. Play the Inverted Song of Time and bring the flow of 
time back to normal speed. This way, the sun will come up quicker and 
less ghosts will appear. Now play the Song of Double Time, and warp to 
the night of the first day. It should be 12:00 PM. Just run around or 
something... look at the moon maybe. Just wait till 2:00 AM. Make sure 
not to be riding on Epona the Horse. This makes fighting the aliens 
harder. When 2:00 PM rolls around... 

Romani will walk into the barn. Just wait until exactly 2:30 PM. Romani 
cries “They came!!!” All of a sudden, orange spheres pop out of the sky 
and the ghosts land at all places in the field. Wow, that’s some freaky 
music that plays. This is it, the battle has begun!

OK, this is how it works. Have Link just run around the barn on the 
ground. Shoot each alien with one arrow and it will disappear. Do not 
let the aliens get near the barn! And watch out, there are two aliens 
that come at the barn from the back. Make sure they don’t sneak by. If 
you run out of arrows, even though you shouldn’t, there is a patch of 
bushes behind the barn. When the sun first comes up, the aliens 
disappear into thin air. The hard part is over. 

You have won! Romani rewards you with a bottle filled with milk for your 
efforts. You can of course recycle the bottle which you will need to do 
soon. After Romani goes back to bed, get out your Ocarina of Time. Play 
the Song of Time, saving your game and warping back to the dawn of the 
first day.

THINGS TO FIND: 30 Rupees, Red Potion

Once you’re back in Clock Town, get out your Ocarina of Time. Play the 
Inverted Song of Time and slow down the flow of the minutes. Exit out to 
Termina Field and collect 30 Rupees from cutting down bushes. After you 
have the Rupees, enter back into Clock Town then go to West Clock Town. 

From here, you must enter the Trading Post. The door to enter it is on 
the staircase and between the Curiosity Shop and the Bomb Shop. Read the 
signs if your still confused. After you enter into the Trading Post, run 
across the small bridge and over to the counter. Begin talking to the 
shopkeeper then press the analog joystick to the left and highlight the 
Red Potion on the top shelf. Purchase it. Finish speaking with the 
shopkeeper then exit out of the Trading Post. Exit out of West Clock 
Town into Termina Field.

THINGS TO FIND: Shiro the invisible solider, Stone Mask 


Once in the field, get out your Ocarina of Time. Play Epona’s Song to 
get Epona the horse to trot over to you. Climb up on her saddle then 
ride like the wind. Your going to need to ride to the east from Clock 
Town. That’s towards the arid brown region with mountains. You should 
see a series of granite stone columns designating it in the field. Ride 
between them and down the corridor. Exit out of the area. 

In this arid area are tons of Bombchus, so don’t get off your horse 
unless you want them to explode on you. Ride down the corridor. Use a 
carrot just before you reach the first iron fence. Jump over it. Clear 
the area in between then hop a second iron fence. Over to the left 
against the wall should be a circle of small rocks. Trot over to the 
rocks, then hop down off of Epona. Equip your Lens of Truth to a C 
button, then view the center of the circle of rocks. You should see a 
Clock Town solider sitting on the ground and waving at you. Go over and 
talk to him. 

“I’m shocked. You’re the first person who’s ever spoken to me. I’ve been 
here for many years, waving my arms around and asking for help, but 
everyone ignores me and passes me by.” He tells you that he needs 
medicine to make him feel better.  Equip the Red Potion you purchased in 
Clock Town to a C button and hand it over to him. He drinks it down in 
one gulp. In gratitude he gives you the Stone Mask. “You got the Stone 
Mask! Wear it with C to become as plain as stone.” The real value of 
this mask is that no one will notice you when you wear it. 

Run over and mount Epona again. Now you must backtrack the way you came 
from Termina Field. Hop both iron fences again. Once back in the field 
area, you’re going to have to ride clear to the other side. Ride across 
the grass and around Clock Town. Once you reach the other side of the 
field, head down the stone steps. You can tell you’re near the ocean, as 
sand stretches out before you. Ride across the sand with starfishes in 
it, and use a carrot right before the brown wall. Hop over it and ride 
down the beach corridor. Surfing time and I forgot my sunblock...

THINGS TO FIND: Great Bay Owl Statue, Mikau the Zora, Zora Mask, the 
entrance to the Pirates’ Fortress


A lovely cinema scene opens up showing the shoreline and surrounding 
ocean. I love this place, probably the most fun to play in the entire 
game. Ride down the corridor. When you encounter the two broken wall 
pieces, instead of hopping over, ride around them. Ride to the shore of 
the ocean. At the shoreline, get off Epona. You can read the sign if you 
want. “Danger! Keep out! Swimming prohibited due to murky water!” Ignore 
it, and hop in the water. 

Swim straight out, towards the wooden building you see in the distance. 
Once you get to it, climb on top of the wooden platform. Activate the 
owl statue you find here. From the wooden platform, look back to shore. 
Slightly to the right you should see a swarm of seagulls flying around 
in the air. Very hard to miss. Hop in the water and swim towards the 
mass of seagulls. Below them you will notice a Zora floating limp on the 
water. When you get close he starts rambling incoherently “Unghhh... 
somebody...” and tells you to get him to shore. 

Now this is kinda tricky. You’re going to need to swim right behind him, 
and up against his body till the “grab” icon is displayed. Push him all 
the way to the shore. Once he’s there, he’ll take a few slow wobbly 
steps up to the sand and collapse like a sac of fish. Run over to the 
collapsed Zora. He tells you that he is Mikau, head guitarist in the 
Zora band. “I think this is it for me... My final message...” He asks 
you to listen to it. Select “I’ll listen.” 

The Zora gets up and whips out his fishbone guitar. He begins singing 
his awful tune... but luckily it also contains some good info. Their 
lead vocalist has laid some “strange eggs” and she’s lost her voice. 
Gerudo Pirates have gutlessly stolen her eggs. He went to stop them, but 
he got overwhelmed and injured. “Somebody, please rescue her eggs before 
the pirates take their toll. Oh somebody, somebody, please heal my 
soul.” I bet you know what to do now.  

He then dies... Play the Song of Healing. A cut scene now plays showing 
the deceased Zora playing with his fellow musicians in the Zora band. 
The body disappears leaving behind the mask of a Zora on the sand. Link 
picks it up. “You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a 
legendary guitarist!” You can now turn into a Zora. 

Mikau’s spirit appears, leaving behind a simple gravestone marker -- a 
fish skeleton tied to a stick anchored in the sand. Yes, that’s how I 
wish to be remembered... You may read it if you want tips on how to use 
the Zora skills. After you’re done, head out to the shoreline. Equip the 
Zora Mask to a C button since you’ll definitely be using it frequently.   

Put on the Zora Mask and transform into Zora Link. This is my favorite 
transformation. Hop into the water and swim like lightning out to that 
building again. Except once you reach it, turn to the right and keep 
swimming. You should find a small lagoon over here. Head to the back 
wall. Underwater on the wall you should find some wooden panels with 
skull and cross bones on them. Arg matey! Have Zora Link stand next to 
one of them and press A. He’ll charge into it like a drill and break it. 
Once you’ve broken them all you should have uncovered a small tunnel. 
Swim through it and exit out.

THINGS TO FIND: Pictograph of a Gerudo Pirate, Hookshot, Zora Eggs 1 & 2


This place is where the bottles really come into play. I have written 
the walkthrough assuming you have two bottles. Having more of course 
wouldn’t hurt you.

As Zora Link, float up to the surface of the water. Swim forward over to 
shore. Now remove your Zora Mask. Put on your Stone Mask that you got 
from Shiro the solider awhile ago. You’re now invisible to all the 
annoying Gerudo Pirates on patrol. Run forward through the tunnel. At 
the end, a cut scene will play showing the layout of the area too you. A 
huge lagoon with pirates on patrol in motorboats, and a building at the 
other end of the compound. Run forward and have Link hop into the water. 
Don’t take your Stone Mask off unless I tell you too.  

Wait for one of the pirate’s motorboats to drive past you, then grab a 
hold of the side of it and climb aboard. Whip out your Pictograph Box. 
Aim at the Gerudo pirate controlling the boat then take her picture. You 
will use this picture for a trade later, so must make sure to get it. 

Hop off the boat and swim across the water towards the building complex. 
On the left side of the building next to the wall, you will find a stone 
ramp leading up to a Goron switch. Swim over to it and ascend the ramp. 
At the top, hop on top of the switch and equip your Goron Mask to a C 
button. Look out into the water to make sure no pirate motorboats are 
near you. Remove the Stone Mask, and equip the Goron Mask. As Goron 
Link, quickly pound the switch at your feet. You’ll see that underwater 
a ways from you a grate has retracted over a passageway. 

Remove your Goron Mask then quickly put on your Zora Mask. As Zora Link, 
dive into the water and submerge yourself from view of the patrolling 
pirates. Swim to the place where the grate opened and enter the passage. 
Swim down the submerged passage to the end. Break the wooden panel with 
the skull and cross bones on it, then enter into the screened area. Head 
to the left, and travel through the small chambers till you reach the 
first block. Push it out of your way, then control down the tunnel. When 
you reach the second block, pull this one towards you.

Backtrack all the way back to the beginning of the screened area. Now 
take the other path that you just uncovered by moving the block. Head 
down the tunnel and at the end will be a vent with the current moving 
upwards. Swim into the current and blast up. At the top, just swim down 
the watery passage. Remember to dodge the spiky mines, and don’t swim 
into the orange current or it will suck you out of the building back 
into the lagoon outside. At the end is a door. Exit through it.

Use your special Zora ability, and walk along the floor through the 
water, dodging the spiky mines as you go. Ascend to the surface and run 
up the ramp. Turn, and run up the staircase. Just at the top before the 
barrels, turn to the right. Across the way you will see a crystal 
switch. Use your boomerang ability, and aim at the switch. Shoot off 
both of your fins, hitting the switch, and opening up a grate in the 
water below. Run down the stairs and swim out through the passage before 
the grate lowers again.

In this tunnel just swim along the top of the water, dodging the spiky 
mines floating around and the jet of water current. At the end of the 
tunnel go left and ascend up the wooden ladder to a small area. Step on 
the brown switch on the floor, which will raise the bars and give you 
access to a crystal switch on the wall. Don’t hit that crystal switch 
yet. Instead, quickly stand on top of the vent in the floor, then hit 
the crystal switch. Ride the stream off water up through the roof. At 
the top, hop off the water stream into another room.

Ahead you should see a door with bars over it. To the left of the door a 
wooden ladder. Walk over to the ladder and ascend it to the top. Here 
you will find a small alcove with a telescope facing towards the window. 
Just ignore the telescope. Turn around and face into the room, looking 
out of the alcove. You will see two spiky mines dangling on chains just 
in front of you. Destroy them by sending out your fin boomerangs. After 
they explode, you will see a crystal switch across from you on a ledge. 
Hit it with some fin boomerangs and it will open the barred door down 
below you. Hop down to the floor and exit out the door.

Your back in the entrance lagoon area, except up on a ledge. Don’t fall 
in the water again unless you wish to do all those previous obstacles a 
second time. Remove your Zora Mask and transform back into normal Link. 
Now put on your Stone Mask. This is very important. S-t-o-n-e Mask. 
Follow the ledge around the corner and to the end where the torch is. 
Run up the ramp and exit through the dark entryway. Ta-dah! The inner 
sanctum of the Pirates’ Fortress. There’s tons and tons of pirates on 
guard and even a wooden guard tower in the center of the area. But there 
not a problem since you have your Stone Mask on.

Run to the center of the area where the wooden guard tower is. Climb up 
the ladder at the base of it. At the top, run forward and across the 
plank bridge. Kill the Gerudo guard if you feeling especially ruthless. 
*cough* me *cough* :P At the end of the bridge enter in through the 
door. Inside you’ll find a small hallway. Run down it. Suddenly a cut 
scene begins. Tatl stops and spies a bee fly through a barred window 
into the room next your current location. The bee flies into it’s nest 
on the ceiling. Tatl and Link both listen in on a secret meeting.

Apparently the “big cheese” pirate is angry with her lead cohort because 
they lost some of the Zora eggs they stole. Talk about incompetence. 
They discuss that they need to get back the eggs before the Zora’s find 
them, and that they have four eggs with them. The other three are in 
danger of being eaten by Sea Snakes. After the meeting ends, you get 
control of Link again. Get out your Hero’s Bow and load in an arrow. Aim 
through the barred window and at the ceiling. Aim carefully at the bee’s 
nest stuck to the ceiling, then fire off the arrow. The nest will 
plummet to the floor and break open. Watch in delight as the bee’s buzz 
around angrily and chase away all the pirates in the room. Aw, looks 
like they left that treasure chest unguarded! Hehe...

Backtrack and exit through the door and out of the small hallway. Make 
sure your Stone Mask is still on! From this little perch here, fall off 
the ledge to the right. Down below enter the door. This room is where 
you scared off the pirates. Travel down the corridor and around the 
pillars. In the center of the room next to the throne is the treasure 
chest. Go over and open it. “You found the Hookshot! Use it to grapple 
items so you can reel them in or pull yourself over to them.” Oh, so 
shiny! Next to the wall on the left side of the throne you will find an 
aquarium with an angry clam inside and the first Zora egg! 
 
Get out your newly acquired Hookshot. Aim up at the ceiling above the 
aquarium. You should see a large wooden board. Fire off the Hookshot and 
attach to the board, pulling yourself up. Fall down below into the water 
of the aquarium. Put on your Zora Mask, transforming yourself into Zora 
Link, then sink down to the floor of the aquarium. Down here you can 
clearly see the Zora Egg nestled on the floor. Equip one of your bottles 
to a C button. Use it and scoop up the egg. “You put a Zora Egg in a 
bottle! It doesn’t look very healthy. You’d better have someone examine 
it quick!” Now that you have your first egg, float back to the surface 
of the water and hop out of the aquarium to the floor below.

Remove your Zora Mask to turn back into normal Link, then put on your 
Stone Mask. Run and exit out of this throne room entirely. Your now back 
in the large open area with the wooden guar tower. Head down both 
flights off stairs to the ground. Run straight towards the guard tower. 
From here, go to the left. Get out your Hookshot and aim up at the ledge 
higher then you. You should see a pillar with a block on top of it with 
a white circle insignia. Aim at the block, and shoot off your Hookshot. 
Fly over to the pillar. Aim your Hookshot again, this time at the higher 
ledge. You’ll see another pillar. Use your Hookshot and fly over to it.       
Enter the corridor right next to the pillar.

Woo, this room is too easy with your Stone Mask. Just run through the 
room passing the assortments of cannons and barrels to the other end, 
then enter the door. The door shuts and bars behind you. Uh oh... Time 
to prepare for some “fighting.” I say that loosely, because this fight 
isn’t really even a mini-boss. Run forward into the room. All of a 
sudden, a pirate dressed in a green jumpsuit hops down from the ceiling. 
“Halt! We aren’t fooled by that mask!” Boss music begins to play. Scary. 
Hahaha... god this is easy. After she whips out her double sabers, just 
Z-target her and strike her any chance you get. Watch out when she dives 
down at you with a powerful saber strike.

After you’ve spanked her well enough, she’ll spout out “Ugh. Don’t think 
it ends here!” Yea, like whatever. :P In a poof of smoke, she vanishes. 
The bars on both doors retract and you’re free to go. Exit through the 
door with the torches on either side of it. 

Inside this small room, you’ll find an aquarium with the second Zora Egg 
in it. I think you know what to do! Get in there and retrieve the egg 
from the aquarium using your second bottle. Now that you have both of 
your bottles filled, get out of the aquarium. Whip out your Ocarina of 
Time. Play the Song of Soaring, then warp to the Great Bay owl statue 
you activated earlier.

THINGS TO FIND: Marine Research Lab 


Wow, this is easy. From the owl statue, just climb up the wooden ladder 
next to you. At the top, run forward and enter through the door into the 
building that looks like a fish hook/anchor.

THINGS TO FIND: The main aquarium 


From the doorway, you should see a funny looking scientist standing 
beside an enormous aquarium. Run towards the aquarium, on the right side 
of it will be a metal ladder. Ascend the ladder to the top. At the top, 
stand over the grate on the top of the aquarium. Directly in the center 
of the grate, make sure of it. Whip out your first bottle with the Zora 
Egg 1 in it. Press the C button to use the bottle, and Link will open it 
and dump the egg into the water where it sinks to the floor of the 
aquarium. Repeat this with Zora Egg 2. Now that their both safely in the 
aquarium, hop down from there and exit out of the Marine Research Lab.

THINGS TO FIND: Pirates’ Fortress (again)


Once outside of the lab, put on your Zora Mask and transform. As Zora 
Link, hop down into the water. Swim through the water back to the 
entrance of the Pirates’ Fortress, then enter in through the tunnel.

THINGS TO FIND: Zora Eggs 3 & 4


I think you know the drill. Float up to the surface of the water then 
swim forward onto land. Remove your Zora Mask and turn back to normal. 
Now put on your Stone Mask. Run forward and hop into the water, then 
swim across the lagoon to that ramp against the left wall with the Goron 
switch on it. When you reach it, jump onto the land and run up the ramp 
to the Goron Switch. Face towards the building. Take out your handy 
dandy Hookshot that you have collected and aim across to the building. 
You should see a white and black target. Aim at it, fire off your 
Hookshot, and pull yourself across. Shortcut heaven. Run to the right 
along the catwalk then up the set of stairs. Enter the sanctum again.

This place should be familiar to you. From your entry point, over to the 
left you’ll find a low ledge with a pillar you can Hookshot too. Aim 
your Hookshot and pull yourself over there, then aim to the left again 
to the higher ledge. This ledge with have a pillar with an exit corridor 
right next to it. Hookshot and pull yourself up there, then enter the 
corridor. 

Just some meandering hallways here with a pirate guard, no trouble. Run 
forward to the fork in the path, then go left. Go around the corner and 
enter the door. It bars behind you. Looks like Mrs. I’m-a-Pretty-Pirate 
wants a rematch... Run to the center of the room and the pirate lady 
will fall to the floor. Oh God! An orange jumpsuit?! And I thought the 
green one was tacky! Z-Target and beat the stuffing out of her with your 
sword like before. After the pirate is beaten senseless, she runs away 
again and the doors unbar. Enter through the door with torches on either 
side of it.

You enter into another small chamber with an aquarium. Oh look, Zora Egg 
3 is at the bottom of it. Hop on in and retrieve the egg with your first 
empty bottle. Be careful, this aquarium is swarming with bone fishes. 
And ignore the treasure chest if you want, it’s just a stupid red rupee.
Now that you have the egg hopefully, make sure to turn back into normal 
Link and put on your Stone Mask. Exit out the door just beside the 
aquarium. The one you didn’t use previous.

Once outside, your back in the outside sanctum area, except in a little 
alcove. Run forward and fall to the ground. Now turn left, and you 
should see the place you entered from right at the beginning. Run past 
this entry point back to the low ledge again. Aim with your Hookshot, 
pull yourself up to the pillar. Now aim for the pillar to your left 
again, the one right next to the corridor. Pull yourself over to it. 
This time, aim to your right, across the way to the highest and final 
Hookshot pillar. Pull yourself over to it like before. 

Hop down to the ground, and run across the railed catwalk to the other 
side. Put the one inept guard out of her misery, then exit through the 
door. This chamber is a small one, and three pirates pace around the 
room. Their guarding the treasure chest at the center of the area. You 
can open it if you want, it contains a Silver Rupee. After collecting 
your booty, head up the other ramp and exit out the door.    

You enter in to a dark and gloomy mechanical room of some sort. The door 
bars behind you. Yes I’m sorry to say, but you’re going to have to 
battle the pirate lackey again. Don’t worry, this is the last duel. Run 
to the center of the room. And down she pops from the ceiling on cue. Z-
Target, slash, rinse, repeat. After she’s had enough, she finally leaves 
you alone! Doors unbar, exit out the door with the torches. 

Standing before you is the last aquarium in the Pirates’ Fortress, 
housing Zora Egg 4. Jump in for a swim and retrieve the egg with your 
other empty bottle. You now have collected 4 of 7 Zora Eggs, there are 
none remaining in the fortress. The other 3 we will collect shortly. 
Exit out of the aquarium, then run down the ramp to the door at the end. 
Leave via the door. Once outside, make sure your in normal Link form 
then whip out your Ocarina of Time. Play the Song of Soaring and warp to 
the Great Bay owl statue. Whoosh!

going. Hop down from the top of the aquarium to the floor below. If your 
not Zora Link already, transform into it. Exit the lab.

Jump down from the wooden dock area down into the water. As Zora Link, 
swim all the back to the main shore. That place where you got the Zora 
Mask and where the buildings are. When you reach the sandy shore, travel 
across the sand towards the two buildings. Enter the white one with the 
red slate roof. Welcome to fish central.

Run across the floor over to the hut owner. Except don’t talk to him. 
Instead, stand next to the aquarium beside him with the yellow Sea Horse 
in it. Speak to the Sea Horse. “Help me... Please, take me back to the 
waters near Pinnacle Rock...” The owner asks if you want the Sea Horse, 
and you most certainly do. He tells you he’ll give it to you only on one 
condition, in trade for a pictograph of a female Gerudo pirate. I told 
you you’d need the pictograph! Hand over the hard-earned picture, and in 
return he gives you the Sea Horse in one of your empty bottles. With Sea 
Horse in hand, exit the shop.

THINGS TO FIND: Pinnacle Rock


Firstly, transform into Zora Link for easy swimming. Now head out to the 
shoreline. At the shoreline, you should be able to see the Marine 
Research Laboratory. To the right of it in the distance will be two huge 
stone pillars sticking out from the water. Dive into the water and swim 
out to them. Once you reach them, have Zora Link swim between the two 
stone pillars.

THINGS TO FIND: Correct path through the sand maze, Sea Snakes’ Lair, 
Zora Eggs 5, 6, & 7


Submerge Zora Link down to the ocean floor. Run forward directly to the 
first wooden sign. Take out the bottle housing the Sea Horse and release 
it back into the water. The Sea Horse then speaks to you. “You have 
strange powers, [INSERT NAME]. I have a request for you. Please follow 
me.” Follow the Sea Horse through the murky/dirty water from signpost to 
signpost. Sure you “can” do this maze without a Sea Horse, but why 
bother when this is easier? 

Once you follow the Sea Horse all the way through the maze, you’re at 
the doorstep to the Sea Snakes’ Lair. You don’t have to kill all the Sea 
Snakes if you don’t wish too. Enter through the gap with the rock on 
either side. Here you find a utterly huge cylindrical column “pit” going 
down into the sea. All along the walls of this pit are small alcoves 
where the Sea Snakes lurk. Make sure not to get eaten, don’t swim to 
close to an alcove opening. There are three Zora Eggs hidden around in 
three of the alcoves, or Zora Eggs 5,6 & 7. Listed below is some tips on 
where to get each of them.

How to kill a Sea Snake:
------------------------ 
Swim and stand on the “lip” of an alcove, then wait for the Sea Snake to 
pop out. While it’s waving it’s head out of the alcove, aim your fin 
boomerangs at it’s neck. That’s the green bulge right behind the brown 
head. It takes two strikes with your fins to kill the snake. You must 
kill the snake in the alcove before collecting the egg there. 

Zora Egg 5 Location:
--------------------
This one is in the top row of alcoves, in the alcove directly across 
from you when you first enter the Sea Snakes’ Lair. Scoop it up with a 
bottle like the previous eggs.

Zora Egg 6 Location:
--------------------
Search the alcoves along the middle of the cylindrical pit. The egg is 
in one of those, it’s easy to spot in the alcove since it’s white and 
the water is dark blue.

Head back to the Marine Lab:
----------------------------
Since you’ve collected two eggs, both of your empty bottles should be 
full to capacity. Exit the Sea Snakes’ Lair, and Pinnacle Rock. In Great 
Bay Coast, swim all the way back to the Marine Research Laboratory. 
Inside, deposit Zora Egg 5 & 6 in the main aquarium. After that, exit 
the lab, swim all the way back to Pinnacle Rock. Follow the Sea Horse 
again through the maze, then enter the Sea Snakes’ lair a second time. 

One Egg is Left (Zora Egg 7):
-----------------------------
This final egg can be found in one of the two alcoves at the very bottom 
of the Sea Snakes’ Lair. Collect it with one of your empty bottles. You 
now have all the eggs. Good job!

Final Rendezvous: 
-----------------
With the egg in hand, swim out of the Sea Snakes’ Lair. Exit out of 
Pinnacle Rock and back into the Great Bay Coast. From here enter the 
Marine Research Laboratory for the final time...

THINGS TO FIND: The main aquarium (last time), New Wave Bossa Nova


Climb the metal latter to the top of the aquarium for the final time. 
Get out your bottle with Zora Egg 7 in it, then deposit into the water. 
The scientist pipes up at you “Good. All of the eggs have been brought 
together. ...It’s going to start. Quick! Come to the front of the 
aquarium!” Do as he says and hop down to the floor where he is. Face the 
aquarium. All of the eggs hatch into ugly baby Zora! Basically bulbous 
heads with fish tails. The babies swim up and form the notes to a song!

Get out your Ocarina of Time or Fishbone Guitar, and follow along with 
the notes. “You learned the New Wave Bossa Nova! It’s the melody taught 
by the Zora children that invigorates singing voices.” Well spank me 
down and call me sushi! Now you have to play this song to whoever laid 
these strange eggs. Better get cracking! Pun... hoho! Exit out of the 
Marine Research Laboratory.

THINGS TO FIND: Another beach shore, Zora Hall


Make sure your in Zora Link form. Hop down into the ocean then swim all 
the way back to the shore with the two buildings. On the beach, find the 
place where the two canoes are docked next to the trees. Head past the 
canoes to the wall, and you should see an exit alcove. Run through it.

This a separate shore of beach. From the coastline head out into the 
water. Swimming towards the huge island of rock with that fish tail 
sticking out the top of it. When you get close to it, dive under the 
water and swim through the entrance hole of the rock. Watch out for the 
Like Like. Swim through the fish head carved entrance.

THINGS TO FIND: Great Bay Coast meeting place 


The view opens up to a huge aquatic cavern, filled with Zora apartments, 
a seashell stage and even the local population of the Zora themselves. 
Run forward down the large corridor, then turn right with path at the 
edge of the water. Follow it around, and enter in the first alcove you 
spot. Alcove, not door. Head up the ramp on the left.

THINGS TO FIND: Zora Cape owl statue, Lulu the Zora, Giant Turtle 


You enter into a small area surrounded by water. A tiny island just 
ahead. If your in Zora Link form like you should be, remove your Zora 
Mask and turn back to normal. Over to the left of you will be an owl 
statue. Strike it with your sword and activate it. You’ve done all you 
can for right now. 

So just get out your Ocarina of Time, play the Song of Time and warp 
back to the dawn of the first day. When your back at the Clock Tower 
entrance, get out your Ocarina of Time again. Play the Inverted Song of 
Time to slow down the flow of the minutes. There’s NO NEED to stock up 
on arrows, bombs and magic energy since you can find that stuff in a 
bit. Take out your Ocarina of Time the final time. Play the Song of 
Soaring and warp over to the Zora Cape owl statue.

See that patch of scrubs right next to the owl statue? Cut the scrubs 
down to get bombs, arrows, an magic energy. One bush even has a pink 
fairy, so try to catch it in a bottle. After you’re fully stocked up, 
put your Zora Mask on. On the opposite of the owl statue you’ll find 
Lulu, the head singer of the Zora band just looking down at the ground. 
Time to cheer her up!

Stand in front of Lulu and get out your Fishbone Guitar. Play the New 
Wave Bossa Nova. Lulu sings with you for the duration of the song. Out 
of no where, the small island behind you turns into a gigantic turtle! 
“Mm... Mm... Yeeeeaawn! I slept quite well!” Apparently, Great Bay is in 
need of your heroic services. The turtle tells you “Quickly. Climb onto 
my back.” It’s time to take on Great Bay Temple! Remove your Zora Mask 
to turn back into normal Link. Stand as close as possible to the edge of 
water that’s nearest the turtle. Get out your Hookshot and aim at the 
trunk of one of the trees on the giant turtle’s back. Fire it off and 
pull yourself up to the turtles shell. 

The turtle then takes you off to Great Bay Temple. In mid-ride you get 
to watch a lovely cut scene showing the Gerudo Pirate lackeys getting 
flung around in the air -- from the huge ocean cyclone surrounding the 
Great Bay Temple. Guess they should have ridden the Turtle? :P

THINGS TO FIND: Dungeon Map, Compass, 1 Silver Key, Ice Arrows, 1 Boss 
Key, Gyorg’s Remains 


The giant turtle delivers you to the first room of the temple, a huge 
docking area. Link waves as he departs the Turtle. Put on your Zora Mask 
and turn into Zora Link. I think it’s time for a swim. Run forward and 
exit though the spotted door. This next room contains many mechanical 
pumps and rotors. Tatl chimes up “Whoa! That’s a huge waterwheel!” Jump 
off the platform and into the water. Swim to the right corner in the 
back of the room. That’s the one next to the pulsating yellow pipes. At 
the bottom of the water is a propeller switch for you to turn. Submerge 
yourself down to the switch and push on the side of it so it spins 
counter-clockwise. 

After it’s fully turned, a nearby hydro-pump is activated. Swim back to 
the door you first entered this room from. Facing the door, take the 
lift on the left. At the top, hop across to the second floor. Watch out 
for the two Skulltulas! Run to the end of the platform. Hop across to 
the stream of water and land on top of it when the water is at it’s 
lowest level and not jetting up. 

Wait here for the water to jet up, then jump across to the next brown  
platform. Run around the corner and up the ramp. Travel down this narrow 
corridor with the pipes on both sides of the ceiling. And you come to a 
huge room with a turbine of water below. “Hmmm...I get it... That huge 
waterwheel is powering this thing.” Tatl tells you. Take a leap of faith 
and jump down into the spinning water. Currently, it’s moving a counter- 
clockwise direction. As the water spins you around, have it “throw” you 
into the hallway of the highest corridor in the water. Don’t worry, 
there’s only two possible corridors to access, one at the top and one at 
the bottom.    

After you make it in, the water current makes you fly down the small 
brown tunnel. You come out in a large chamber partially filled with 
water. Float up to the surface. You can see three ledges around in here. 
Head to the lowest one that’s against the wall and climb up onto it. 
Remove your Zora Mask and transform back into Normal Link. Get out your 
handy dandy Hookshot and aim out into the room. Across the way you’ll 
see a nice treasure chest sitting on another higher ledge. Aim at it, 
then fire the Hookshot. Once your pull yourself across open the chest 
and claim your prize of the Dungeon Map. 

Put on your Zora Mask and transform. Hop into the water and submerge 
down to the bottom. Eliminate the two annoying bone fish swimming around 
in the water with your Fin Boomerangs, if they happen to annoy you. Turn 
your eyes towards the walls of the room. Hopefully you’ll easily spot 
the exit hallway out of here guarded by two Dexihands. Get rid of the 
dang hands of Satan, then swim into the hallway. Land on the floor and 
run all the way to the end. 

Once you come to the small room with the three suspended Bio Deku Babas, 
ignore them and run past them sticking as close as possible to the left 
wall of the passage. Float to the surface of the water in the left 
corner, narrowly missing the Deku Baba’s bites. Exit out of the door. 
Whatever you do, don’t fall into that river with the fast current that’s 
right underneath where your standing. This takes you all the way back to 
the central room with the huge tank of spinning water. Instead, just 
trot forward and towards the edge of the gentle pool of water. 

See how the top of those two Bio Deku Baba’s are merely lillypads? Hop 
across the two lillypads then jump over to where the treasure chest is 
in the alcove. Watch out for the Real Bombchu! Dispatch it anyway you 
like then open the chest. The prize awaiting you being a nice shiny 
compass. Jump down from the alcove into the pool of water. Sink all the 
way to the bottom where... you come to another treasure chest! Get rid 
of any resistance you encounter with your Fin Boomerangs -- that's the 
Dexihand guarding the chest. Once the coast is clear, walk over and open 
up it up to get a Silver Key.  

Swim to the surface of the pool of water, and back over to dry land. 
Pull yourself up, and yes, NOW you can hop into the river with the fast 
current. Watch as your body is sucked out like a bag of tin cans. Once 
you’re blown back into the huge room of spinning water, carefully make 
your way to the very bottom. Have the water current “throw” you out 
through the corridor at the very bottom. Fly through the corridor and 
the water will spit you out into another chamber. Ignore all those 
dastardly clams and float to the surface of the water.

Swim towards the large red pipe. It’s kinda hard to miss, considering 
it’s red, and a large pipe... :P  Once you’re there, run up it like it 
was a set of stairs. Watch out for the Real Bombchu scurrying around on 
the thin pipe. Edge up to it, then smack it away with your shield when 
it dashes at you. Run to the end of the pipe then exit out the locked 
door to your right, using up the one and only Silver Key in this temple.  

Remove your Zora Mask and turn into normal Link. This little chamber has 
a Green and Yellow Chuchu and some pots for you to stock up on supplies. 
And make SURE that you do, because the next room contains the temple’s 
first mini-boss. Once your all stocked up and ready to go, enter into 
the next chamber. The door bars behind you. The chamber is quiet, too 
quiet... Take a deep breath look up at the ceiling... HOLY fruit salad! 
Watch as the strange creature that’s merely a green blob with one huge 
eye fall to the floor, followed by a rather large group of strange pink 
Jello orbs. Come on... you KNOW there’s always room for Jello! TO find 
out strategies on how to fight this mini-boss, Wart, check the bosses 
section of the guide.   

After Wart finally gets his eye poked out like his mother warned him 
about so many years ago, a treasure chest appears in the center of the 
room. Don’t just stand there, open it! “You got the Ice Arrows! ...Now 
you can freeze enemies and objects! Try it everywhere.” And don’t worry, 
unlike in the previous game Ocarina of Time, the Ice Arrows are not 99% 
useless. You’ll be using them frequently. But hey, I’m sure I’m not the 
only one who thought the Ice Arrows always ruled... freezing those giant 
centaur people in the Sacred Forest Groove. Who’s with me?! :P

With your spanking-new Ice Arrows in hand, exit out of the chamber. You 
can restock on supplies here if wish too... Otherwise exit this green 
chamber as well. Dead ahead, you should see a red pipe leading to 
another propeller switch. This will help water flow through parts of the 
pipe, you’ll understand why this is important at the very end of the 
temple. Run to the left and follow the red pipe back down. At the water 
swim across and pull yourself up onto the platform. To your right a 
Octorok should make it’s presence felt painfully clear by shooting rock 
projectiles at you.

Take out your snazzy Ice Arrows and take aim at the Octorok. Fire off an 
arrow. If the arrow strikes it’s body, it should freeze into a large 
iceberg with a flat top -- also the perfect platform to scale. Jump up 
on top of the “Octoberg” then over to the propeller switch. Turn it. If 
you notice carefully, the red pipe is now flashing. This means water is 
flowing freely through it. Put on your Zora Mask and transform, sinking 
to the bottom of the water. Make your way out of this room through the 
exit tunnel. That’s the one without the red pipe on the ceiling of it. 

In the large room of spinning water, make your way to the top of it and 
once again have the water “throw” you into the corridor you can access. 
You’ll fly through the hall once again and into a room you’ve visited 
before. Have yourself surface and make your way to the lowest ledge 
against the wall. Remove your Zora Mask and turn back into a human, then 
get out your Hookshot. Aim out into the room and across the way towards 
the now-opened treasure chest. Fire it and pull yourself over. You’re 
now going to learn another lesson in Ice Arrows 101. If you shoot an Ice 
Arrow at the water, it will freeze some of the water around the arrow 
impact radius creating a small platform AKA iceberg. Didn’t I just sound 
scientific then? :P  

Ahead you should see an alcove with two red pipes leading to it and a 
door. Fire your Ice Arrows into the water ahead of you to create a 
bridge of icebergs. Hop along the icebergs and then jump into the 
alcove. Exit out the door. Lying before you is a propeller switch, but 
it is far too high for you to jump to it. Here’s how you remedy that 
situation. See the Blue Chuchu below the propeller switch? Have it hop 
out towards you into the room. Run around it, then wait right underneath 
the propeller switch. Have the Blue Chuchu hop towards you, then shoot 
it with an Ice Arrow. It’s now frozen and like a stepping stone -- hop 
on top of the ice block then jump over to the propeller switch. Watch 
out for that dang Real Bombchu. Turn the switch. Hmmmm! More liquid 
refreshment! Jump down from your perch and exit the room.  

Put on your Zora Mask then hop into the water. Sink to the bottom then 
exit out the corridor guarded by the two moronic Dexihands. You SHOULD 
know how to kill them by now. Head down the hall in a typical fashion 
and get past the three Bio Deku Babas again. Exit out the door. We’re 
back in the room where we got the Silver Key and Compass, but with one 
big difference: the Ice Arrows! 

Ahead and over to the right you’ll see a corridor next to a wall of gold 
colored bars. You can’t access it just by just jumping to it. Instead 
get out your Ice Arrows and shoot them into the water to make a bridge 
of icebergs to cross. Cross the icebergs then hop into the alcove. 
Somebody left the air conditioner on. How many times have I told you not 
to touch the thermostat?! Make you way down the corridor and chop down 
the icicles in your way. You come to a door frozen over from the cold. 
Get out your Fire Arrows and melt away the ice. Prepare for your second 
mini-boss fight by arming yourself with your Ice Arrows. Exit through 
the door.  

Immediately when you step inside, Gekko (previously a mini-boss from the 
Woodfall Temple) spots you and calls for reinforcements. Looks like 
Gekko wants another Link-style beat down, eh? Go Visit “Gekko -- the 
rampage continues” in the bosses section for strategies on how to beat 
him. After he’s reverted by to his cowardly frog self the doors unbar. 
Exit out the one on the left. You come to the chamber that previously 
taunted you behind that golden gate. Open the blue and gold enameled 
treasure chest to rechieve the Boss Key!  

To exit this chamber, jump out through the slit in the golden grating. 
After you’ve landed in the water, put on your Zora Mask. It’s time for 
another swim. Jump into the river with the fast moving current an have 
it take you away. Back in the chamber with the spinning water, again. 
But this time, swim all the way to the surface of the water. Fight the 
spinning current as best you can and swim to the outer edge of the water 
pool. Grab a hold of the outer edge and pull yourself to safety. Run 
along the ledge and ascend the wooden ladder -- there should be one on 
either one or the other side of you. 

At the top, face out into the room. You should see spinning paddles 
moving around and passing by in front you. Jump down and land on one of 
these paddles as it passes. Ride it around in a circle, then press 
forward on the control stick as the paddle passes underneath the catwalk 
so you grab a hold. Pull yourself up. Hopefully your on the correct side 
of the catwalk. The side with the ladder exit being blocked by a fast 
moving stream of water. If not, get to the opposite side of the catwalk. 

Once your on the correct side take off your Zora Mask and get out your 
Ice Arrows. Aim at the stream of water blocking access to the ladder and 
fire off the arrow. The water will freeze at it’s source (the hole in 
the roof) and the stream will stop. Ascend the ladder and exit out of 
the door. Kill the Blue Tektite bouncing around to your right. In the 
room ahead will a high platform with some barrels on it. Get out your 
Hookshot and aim at one of the barrels. Fire it and pull yourself over.

Now direct your attention to the right. On a little island you can spot 
another propeller switch. Using your Ice Arrows, create a bridge of 
icebergs and make your way over to it. Turn the switch clockwise. Water 
be flowing! Put on your Zora Mask and transform, then hop into the water 
below. Swim over to the door you first entered from then exit out. Hop 
down from this high area to the thin catwalk below. Catch a ride on one 
of the spinning paddles and get to the opposite side of the catwalk. 
Remove your Zora Mask. 

Run up the ramp and down the hallway with the yellow and red pipes on 
the ceiling. If you did everything correctly, they should BOTH be 
flashing. Run out into the room, but stay on this second floor ledge. 
Face the spinning wheel ahead and look to the right in the corner. You 
should see a propeller switch, the access point being a jet of water 
bobbing up and down. But you’re probably sitting there wondering to 
yourself -- how do I jump all the way to the water stream? Simple. Get 
out your Hookshot and aim at the ceiling above the water stream. You 
should see a faint little white target (those crafty programmers!). Fire 
your Hookshot at the target and fly over, falling down and landing on 
the water stream. Wait for it to jet up, then hop over to the propeller 
switch. 

Turn it of course! After it’s turned the great red pillar in the center 
of the room shoots up a stream of water. This counters the yellow pillar 
with the stream of water, causing the central waterwheel to stop turning 
altogether. Never fear of course! Jump down into the water below and 
switch to the propeller switch at water level stationed between the two 
great pillars. Turn it... it the magic of what we call “water pressure” 
the yellow pillar stops spitting water, causing the red pillar to spin 
the wheel the opposite direction. This also reverses the water direction 
in the great room of spinning water, allowing you to access some new 
corridors and pay the temple boss a visit (it’s a DOOZY this time, no 
crappilly easy boss like Goht).

Head back to the entry/exit door in the room then take the lift on it’s 
left side up to the second floor again. Hop off onto the platform. Run 
to the end, jump to the water jet, then over to the other platform. Run 
along this one as well, up the ramp and down the piped hall way. At the 
end put on your Zora Mask. Jump down into the spinning water at the 
floor of the room. It’s now spinning the opposite direction, clockwise. 
Submerge yourself down into the water about halfway, then have the water 
“throw” you into the one corridor that you can access.

You whip quickly down the hallway, quickly move to the right side of it 
so you can dodge the two Dexihands that zoom by. Another watery chamber 
you come too. Go around the three spiky mines ahead and get up against 
the wall to your right. Walk into the corner and surface. Climb up onto 
the platform. Beside you will be an elevator. Take it up. 

Face so you’re looking across the axle of the large wheel. On the other 
side will be a platform moving back and forth. Wait for the time when 
you platform ascends to the highest point, while the other platform 
moves closest to your position. Jump across to the other platform and 
land. Ride across and jump onto the ledge. Run along the ledge to the 
end. In front of you will be spinning paddles you can’t jump too since 
there moving. Remove your Zora Mask and get out your Ice Arrows. Aim at 
the corner of the room diagonal to your own -- where you find a stream 
of water is powering the paddles to move. Fire an Ice Arrow and freeze 
the water, stopping the paddles in front of you. Hop over to the paddle 
then run to the opposite one. Jump into the alcove. Exit out the door.      

Run down the twisty hallway and enter a room full of traps so diabolical 
I can’t even describe it... Three teeter-totters... AH!!! THE HORROR! :P 
Jump down into the room and ignore the teeter-totter directly in front 
of you for right now. Run left to the set of two teeter-totters and jump 
on the very lowest panel. Get out your Fire Arrows and aim up at the 
ceiling. Pretty close to you on the ceiling you should see a hole in the 
roof frozen up with ice. Obviously shoot the ice. The water streams down 
onto the panel opposite of you on the teeter-totter lifting you up one 
level. DON’T fall down now! 

Jump across to the teeter-totter panel beside you. Aim up at the ceiling 
again and shoot this next ice patch with another Fire Arrow. You’re 
elevated up yet another level to the top. Jump across to the propeller 
switch and turn it. Water flows fresh once again. Now, for THE most 
challenging part of the entire temple... get out your Ocarina of Time. 
Done that? Good. Now play the Song of Soaring and warp back to the 
temple entrance. Hard huh?    

At the entrance run forward and enter the door. Time to make your way 
top the temple boss... Take the lift on your right up to the top. Hop 
across to the platform, run down to the end. Use the water jet and scale 
the gap. Exit out of this room using the hallway with pipes for the LAST 
time. Thank you God. Put on your Zora Mask and transform. Jump down to 
the spinning water below and sink ALL the way to the bottom. Have the 
water throw you out into the corridor you find here. Travel through the 
hallway like before. 

Have yourself swim up to the water surface and over to the green pipe 
(which SHOULD be glowing) leading out of the water. Run up the pipe 
rounding those two tricky corners. Yes! This is the FINAL propeller 
switch in the entire temple! SCHWEET! Turn and beside you a jet of water 
activates. This little jet of water allows you to scale across the gap 
to the boss door! Hop over to the water jet when it lowers then to the 
platform on the other side. Run forward and open the gigantic door. The 
golden lock and chains retract and use up your hard-earned Boss Key. 
Link steps through. That makes you quiver in anticipation for the temple 
boss just thinking about it. Admit it... :P  This final chamber before 
the boss is a simple room with a hole in the floor. Fall through it.

Link plummets down through the tunnel in the floor. Landing on a still 
and quiet platform in the middle of a lake of water. What’s that? Air 
bubbles?! Something’s coming out of the water towards Link! Out of 
nowhere a gigantic purple fish leaps out of the water and over the 
platform Link is standing upon. The name Gyorg, Gargantuan Masked Fish 
pops on screen. This fight is going to be VERY difficult if you’ve never 
fought Gyorg before. For good strategies on how to whoop him, check the 
bosses section.

After you’ve gutted Gyorg enough times, he spasms out in the water then 
flaps around on the platform like a fish out of water (that pun was 
brilliant!). Gyorg finally bites the dust and disintegrates into a 
puddle of water -- leaving behind a Heart Container and a guardian mask. 
Go and collect your hard earned Heart Container for more energy on your 
life bar, then step into the shimmering blue portal to nab the guardian 
mask. “You have seized Gyorg’s Remains!” You have freed a spirit that 
was trapped in Gyorg’s body when he was wearing the mask. 

              You have just gotten the third Guardian Mask.

THINGS TO FIND: The dawn of the first day


After collecting the third guardian mask you again warp to the gray 
Guardian Room. After speaking with one of the guardians on getting them 
to try and help you fight Skull Kid, he tells you to “Help our friend.” 
In other words, save the last guardian and get the final guardian mask. 
are you up it? Hopefully, or else I wasted all this typing. :P  For 
destroying Gyorg, the sea’s are once again at piece. In other words, no 
more yucky water. You can go inside to Zora Hall and speak with the band 
who’s all set up on he shell stage. If you speak to Lulu in Zora form 
you can play in the concert. When you’re done messing around, get out 
your Ocarina of Time. Play the Song of Time, and warp back.

THINGS TO FIND: Milk Road


Tatl pipes in saying “The quickest way to the canyon is through the East 
Gate!” We’ll go there in a little bit, but first we need to collect a 
mask. Get out your Ocarina of Time and play the Inverted Song of Time to 
slow down the flow of the minutes. Get out your ocarina again, then play 
the Song of Soaring. Warp to the owl statue in Milk Road.

THINGS TO FIND: full arrow supply, Epona the Horse


Once at the owl statue, chop down the bushes next to it to get a full 
supply of arrows. Now get out your Ocarina of Time. Play Epona’s Song 
have it trot over to you. Climb around. Trot out of Milk Road through 
the passage leading to Termina Field. It’s the one leading into the 
grove of trees.

THINGS TO FIND: The Takkuri (head on a platter says I!), 1 Huge Rupee


Once entering Termina Field, the enemy music should begin to play right 
away from the Takkuri buzzing overhead. You’re SAFE since you’re on the 
horse. Once you get off, you’re fare game. So be careful. To get a good 
view of the Takkuri, I recommend trotting forward through the two wooden 
towers, then over to the left. Wait in the dead tree/grass patch area. 
Get out your Hero’s Bow and aim up. Find the Takkuri flying around, then 
aim at it. Strike it with an arrow. Lather, rinse, repeat about 10 more 
times. After the Takkuri dies, it falls to the ground and spits out a 
Huge Rupee! Go over and collect it. Now you have a full supply of rupees 
to spend. Get back on Epona and trot into Milk Road.

THINGS TO FIND: A Gorman Brother, Garo’s Mask


Hmmmm we’re smack nab in ugly country! Trot forward with your horse (you 
must BE on your horse!) and Z-target the brother standing beside the 
iron fence. Talk with him. After a little chit chat and some taunts, the 
two Gorman Brothers finally ask you if you want to horse race against 
them for the low price of 10 Rupees. If you win, you get and I quote 
“somethin’ nice.” Say “race”, and go off to the race track.   

The race now is about to begin! It’s hardly fair, with two against one 
(and the fact you’re in between the two of them, where they can easily 
trap you). Here’s the best strategy on how to win the race:

The Beginning: 
--------------
This is actually a HIGHLY crucial part of the race. Right when the race 
beings, the two Gorman Brother’s use a carrot and jet ahead. LET THEM. 
Don’t use a carrot, just make sure you’re pressing FORWARD on the 
control stick at the beginning. That way, the race is close, but the two 
brothers are slightly ahead so they can’t trap/cut you off. Now use 
carrots whenever you wish too. 

Obstacles: 
----------
Swerve around all trees. Especially in the two thick groves of them 
along the racetrack. Watch out for the dark patches of dirt, this is mud 
and will slow you down if you trot through it. Use the white strips 
before every mud puddle to hop over. Always take the inside of corners, 
even if it means hopping over iron fences. 

At the End:
-----------
There’s a two ways to do this. Either hop over both of the gates, or 
take the left path and clear both mud puddles. Just don’t mess up! Have 
a carrot or two handy.

After you win (should only take a few tries), the Gorman Brothers are 
very angry! But, they give you a mask as your prize. “You got the Garo’s 
Mask! The wandering ninja spirits who appear at Ikana once wore this.” 
One brother says “In exchange, you can’t tell anyone where you got 
this!” I wouldn’t tell...much... :P  With your new mask in hand, hop 
aboard Epona then gallop out of here. Exit Milk Road and back into 
Termina Field.

THINGS TO FIND: East Gate, Ikana Graveyard


All you have to do is ride Epona clear to the other side of the field. 
Go around the perimeter of Clock Town and find the exit that looks brown 
and arid, with the stone pillars. Ride between them and down the 
corridor. Exit out of this area. This place should be familiar, where 
you got the Stone Mask. Just keep galloping down the corridor, running 
over all the Real Bombchus. After you hop both of the iron fences, stop 
in your tracks, and turn left. Trot over to the rock pillar with the  
low ledge behind it. Make sure no Real Bombchus are following you, then 
dismount your horse. Hop up the low ledge. Then run down the corridor.

THINGS TO FIND: Giant sleeping skeleton, Captain’s Hat, night of the 
first day, guarded gravestone   


The scene opens up to a “deathly” quiet graveyard. Got too love those 
puns! Just have Link run forward and follow the winding dirt trail. At 
the end you may find Dampe the grave keeper. You can talk with him, but 
otherwise run around him and keep following the dirt trail. A building 
should come into view. The only route though the building is blocked by 
a giant sleeping skeleton. Tatl glows green next to it, which should be 
your first hint... Make SURE you have full arrows and magic. And equip 
your Fire Arrows to a C-Button. 

Edge as close as possible to the skeleton. Get out your Ocarina of Time, 
and play the Sonata of Awakening. Egad! The giant skeleton wakes up! 
Standing upright, he takes out the overhang of the building, and begins 
to run away! Run after the skeleton immediately, and Z-target it. Shoot 
a Fire Arrow at it’s body. He lights ablaze and the skeleton pauses for 
about five seconds, running around in place. 

Primary Goal:
-------------
Just so no one is confused (because the other guides kind of glazed over 
these details) your primary goal is to FIGHT the skeleton. What you do 
is, keep hitting it (Z-target!) with fire arrows to slow it down, so it 
gets closer and closer to you. Once it’s within reach, HIT it with your 
sword to start the battle. Then just hack it till it gives up. Catching 
the skeleton is actually HARDER then beating it. The only obstacles are 
the flame walls. Beat the two Stalchild to have the flames extinguish. 

If the skeleton beats you around the path, he makes it back to the 
original spot he was sleeping at. “If you could not even catch me, then 
that must be all the strength you have.” The giant skeleton then plunges 
into the sand, and disappears. You have to wake him up again, and try 
catching him a second time. Exit the graveyard, and come back for him to 
reappear. 

After the skeleton is defeated by you (after one or two tries), he gives 
up. “Wait! It is my loss! Sheathe your weapon!” Both of you are then 
talking, back at the original start of the race. The skeleton tells you 
his name is Skull Keeta, and that he once commanded the Ikana Army in 
the kingdom atop the hill. He wishes you too go and fulfill his request. 
“I ask you to take my soul, which rests in the fiercely burning flame... 
And convey my words to my men, who, even in death, remain loyal to me. 
Tell them the war has ended...” The skeleton salutes you, and salute 
back. The skeleton disappears, and so do the flames surrounding the 
treasure chest. 

Get on your Hookshot, and aim over at the chest. Fire it off and pull 
yourself over. Open up and see what it is! :P “You got the Captain’s 
Hat! Wear it with C. The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance 
to this symbol of authority.” Now get out your Ocarina of Time. Play the 
Song of Double Time and warp to the night of the FIRST day. IF it’s not 
the FIRST day, this wouldn’t work. When it’s nighttime, make sure to put 
on your Captain’s Hat. Run into the field with all the gravestones. And 
you’ll find little parties of skull soldiers. Even one hanging in the 
tree! Talk with any of them since you’re in disguise. Now find the three 
skull soldiers who are pacing around a gravestone, guarding it. Talk to 
one of them, and give the order “Open the grave.” They’ll do as they’re 
told, and break the gravestone to pieces. Fall into the hole!

THINGS TO FIND: Iron Knuckle, Song of Storms


Run forward and hop the gap, landing on the first platform. Hop over to 
the ledge and exit through the corridor. Ahead, a small room with a 
barred door and a HUGE swarm of black bats comes into view. I know what 
you’re thinking, kill the bats and the door unbars, right? WRONG! Don’t 
do that. Instead, find the two unlit torches. Quickly light them by 
hitting each with a Fire Arrow. Run through the door after it unbars to 
avoid the bat kamikazes. 

After enter the next room, the door bars again. Uh-oh... in The center 
of this small room is a silent and still metal statue. Go over and 
strike it with your sword. All of a sudden boss music starts and the 
metal statue awakens! This is Iron Knuckle. See the boss section if you 
need help on defeating him. After he’s done for, he collapses and 
disappears in a cloud of purple smoke. The door unbars. 

At the back of the room a certain raises revealing a gravestone and a 
ghost. His name is Flat. He is one of two composers for the Ikana royal 
family. He says his brother, Sharp, locked him in here and to take the 
song inscribed beside him. After the ghost is gone, run up to the 
gravestone. Check it. “The thousand years of raindrops summoned by my 
song are my tears. The thunder that strikes the earth is my anger!” Now 
learn the song inscribed on the stone. “You remembered the Song of 
Storms! This melody that you’ve heard before is the turbulent tune that 
blows curses away.” With the song now in your memory, exit out of this 
chamber through the door. Continue backtracking, exit through the dark 
corridor. Hop across the two pits and take the column of light back 
outside to the graveyard.

THINGS TO FIND: The mysterious man, old tree trunk, Ikana Canyon


Since it should be nighttime, this corridor should be swarming with Blue 
Bubbles. Make sure not to touch them, or you’ll get jinxed -- which 
means Link will flash and can’t draw his sword for awhile. Run down to 
the end of the corridor and hop off the ledge to where you left Epona 
standing. Ignore her. Head around the stone pillar and across the open 
area to where the sign is. To the left of the sign is a high ledge where 
a mysterious man is sitting dangling his legs over. 

Put on your Garo’s Mask that you won from the horse race, then talk to 
the man. He compliments you on the nice mask your wearing. At the end, 
he says “Perhaps you my be able to save the souls that wander beyond 
here... Yee-hee-hee.” Behind the man an old tree trunk springs from the 
ground... And the man fades away. Get out your Hookshot and aim at the 
new tree trunk. Fire it off and pull yourself up. Run past the large 
boulders, going down the wide corridor. Exit out of here.

THINGS TO FIND: Ikana Canyon owl statue, Ghost of Sharp, Music Box House  


Opening up before you is a huge canyon -- a large river separates the 
lower half with the plateau part. Run forward across the open plain over 
to the wooden docks at the riverside. Ahead, two Octoroks will pop out 
of the river and pay you a visit. You’re going to need to use them as a 
bridge to get over to the dock piece on the other side of the river. To 
do that, get out your Ice Arrows. Z-target at the Octorok farthest from 
you first, then shoot off an arrow and freeze it. Freeze the other 
closer one. Hop across the two newly formed icebergs and then to the 
wooden dock.

Facing towards the stone wall, get out your Hookshot. Aim up an to the 
left. You’ll spy a tree trunk on a high ledge. Fire the Hookshot and 
pull yourself over. Then aim up and across the river to an even high 
trunk on a ledge. Fire, and pull yourself over. Aim across the river a 
final time at the tree on the plateau area. Fly on over there. Next to 
the tree is a nice little owl statue. Activate it with your sword. No 
need to ever scale across the river again!

From the owl statue head inward on the plateau away from the river. In 
the distance is a funny looking building with some megaphones attached 
to it’s roof. Run over to it, then take the ramp up on the right side of 
it. At the back wall you’ll find a cave you can enter. Go over and exit 
into the darkness.  
 
This is a quaint little cavern, with stalagmites on the ceiling and a 
pool of water surrounded by skeletons on the floor. Run deeper into the 
cavern to the edge of the water. A cut scene plays -- the camera zooming 
up to the ceiling. “What business have you in Ikana Kingdom, land where 
only the dead roam?” Out of thin air an angry looking ghost appears. The 
ghosts basically says that if you stay, then you have a death wish. 
“...sleep gently to the melody of darkness that the great composer, 
Sharp, shall play... and join the ranks of the dead.” Sharp plays his 
harmful tune, for every time he waves his composer stick to play a note, 
Link loses some health. Quickly! Get out your Ocarina of Time! Play the 
Song of Storms. 

It begins to rain in the cavern (how in the heck?). The camera view goes 
crazy and Sharp spins out of control and disappears. The water level 
rises in the pool, causing the river outside to fill with water. In 
response, the waterwheel on the side of the strange building turns... 
The megaphones produce a carnival like music. All the Gibdos glow and 
sink into the ground! The door unlocks... Sharp then reappears and 
addresses you. 

“...Ye who do not fear the dead...” Sharp informs you that the dead 
should not be wandering, and it was all the work of Skull Kid. “I wish 
for you to go to the temple in this land and sever the root of the evil 
curse that torments us. To do that... I, the only one who knows the way 
into the temple, shall direct you to the King. The King is in the ruins 
of Ikana Castle, awaiting the coming of the one who will break the 
curse.” Sharp then disappears. Time to investigate that funny building.
Exit out of this cavern.

Follow the river out over the ledge, then fall down to the ground. Run 
around to the front of the building. A little girl playing in the water 
spots you and runs back into the house, locking the door behind her. How 
dastardly! :P  To coax her back outside, head to the right of the 
building. Walk about halfway up the ramp and wait here for a minute or 
two. The girl will come outside of the house again and begin walking 
away from the building. Make sure she’s far enough away, then run to the 
door and enter inside the building.

THINGS TO FIND: Basement, Strange Gibdo, Gibdo Mask 


AH! My ears! My ears! Make it stop Mommy!!! The music is even louder now 
then it was outside! From the kitchen area, head down the stairs to the 
basement. At the other end of the room will be a wooden storage closet. 
Walk towards it... The doors swing open violently. THE HORROR! It’s a 
Gibdo?! Whatever you do, DON’T HIT THE GIBDO. Or else the little girl 
will interfere and mess everything up. Instead, get out your Ocarina of 
Time. Play the Song of Healing. 

The Gibdo holds it’s head and then reverts back into a human male. A 
mask falls to the floor. It turns out, that strange Gibdo was actually 
the little girl’s father. Link picks up the mask. “You got the Gibdo 
Mask! This mask was once the hideous face of Pamela’s father. This mask 
looks so real even a Gibdo would mistake you as one of it’s own.” And 
yes, that’s exactly the point. Now that the father and Pamela are having 
a “private moment” as Tatl calls it, get out your Ocarina of Time. Play 
the Song of Time and warp back to the dawn of the first day.

========================================================================

#1
Name: Skull Kid
Description: Black skin and a bobbing walk. Very gangly looking, he
wears bright scarecrow clothing and the evil Mask of Majora. 
Response From Tatl: None

Attacks: None

Strategy:
When you get to the battle with Skull Kid, a countdown timer appears on
screen. You have 5 minutes to “defeat” him before the moon crashes.
Don’t worry about losing health, Skull Kid has no attacks to hurt you
with. 4 green pots will be lying on the Tower roof, break them if you
happen to need magic energy. Since Skull Kid is floating so high up in
the air, I suggest using Z-Targeting. Simply hit him once with a large
bubble and his body will be temporarily paralyzed. Your Ocarina of Time
will fall from his hand and land on the ground. Run over and pick it up.
Deku Scrub Link’s Deku Pipes will sprout out from his head. And the text
will appear “…suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come flashing back at
you…” You get lost in your own thoughts and go into a flashback cinema
scene. Everything is blinding white and you, Princess Zelda, and Epona
are standing there in gray monotones. You are reminded on how to play
the Song of Time. Tatl nags angrily and tells you to snap out of it and
get with the program. Forget about Skull Kid, play the Song of Time on
your Deku Pipes. Save your game and warp back to the first day.

#2
Name: Dinofols
Description: Large green lizard wearing a suit of plate armor. Sounds
high pitched cries when moving in to attack. Carries a large saber.
Response From Tatl: “What?! Don’t you know about the Dinofols? Use
targeting methods while defending. And watch out for its fiery breath!”

Attacks: A. Shooting fire streams from its mouth  B. Slashing with its
large saber 

Strategy: 
This guy is a push-over, but quite aggressive. Simply slash him with
your sword. Dinofols only takes three slashes and he is dead. He will
constantly try to intimidate, and move in at you. Just move in yourself
and corner him against a wall. Slashing you with his saber takes off one
fourth of a heart, block using your shield. He will make a high pitched
scream right before he is about to attack. Burning you with his fire
breath takes off one half of a heart, the only defense is to run back
away from its range. You can tell you need to run back when he hunches
down, sticks out his head, and opens his mouth. 

3# 
Name: Gekko
Description: A Orange frog with black markings. It stands upright and
has a large gapping mouth with sharp teeth and webbed feet and hands. 
Response From Tatl: “That’s a Gekko. And it’s pretty angry! It’s pretty
weak, too. It really shouldn’t be making a fool of you.”

Attacks: A. Karate kicks. B. Boxing punches. C. Uppercut punches. 
D.(When on Turtle-back) Running over Link.

Strategy:
Gekko is another push-over, except in this battle he has two forms. His
first is just him running after you to attack. The second is him riding
along on Snapper-Turtle-Back.
 
Instruction on Form 1:
        Gekko will hop along after you. Just stand there and wait for
him. When he stops and pauses in front of you, run around to his back.
He will be doing a combo of punches and kicks where you were just at. If
do get hit by the combo, it only takes off a minor one fourth of a
heart. Now slash him in the back. Pretty straight forward, do this three
times, and his whistles to call in help, jumping onto the back of a
Snapper Turtle.

Instruction on Form 2: 
        The snapper turtle will try to run you over. Put your Deku Mask
on and duck into the nearest flower you can find. Wait till the Snapper
Turtle is directly overhead, then launch up. It will hit the sensitive
under belly causing the turtle to flip over and convulse. Gekko will fly
off and up to the ceiling. Take off your Deku Mask. Get out your bow and
load in an arrow. Aim up at the ceiling and find him scurrying along.
Fire up a arrow at him, hitting his body. He will then turn red and fall
to the floor, scurrying back over to the Snapper Turtle. Repeat this
process 3 times and you will have defeated him. If you need extra
arrows, keep in mind when the Snapper Turtle flips over he will drop a
bundle of 10 arrows. 

#4
Name: Wizrobe
Description: An elderly man with pale blue skin. Dons magicians’ cloaks
and a magic wooden staff which he uses as a weapon. 

Attacks: A. Small Blasts of Ice Energy.

Strategy: 
        In the room where you fight Wizrobe, there are 4 energy tiles
located along the floor. Wizrobe will warp from tile to tile trying to
take cheap shots at you. Right when you enter the chamber where Wizrobe
appears, go and wait in a corner. From here you can get a prime vantage
point at all possible places he could materialize. When he warps to a
tile, he will pause for a bit and spin around on top of it, holding his
staff above his head. This is your window of opportunity to hit him with
a arrow from you bow. After a few seconds, if you don’t hit him, he will
take aim with his staff and fire off a blast of blue ice energy at you.
If this occurs, run to another corner of the room and wait to aim again.
If you are hit by the energy, it will freeze you in ice along with a
small section of the floor, taking off one half a heart. When Wizrobe
has been struck by three arrows, he will call in Phanrobes, or fake-
pseudo copies that look like himself. They try only to confuse you.
Ignore them and spot the real Wizrobe. The real one will not be dancing
about the room. Hit him with three more arrows, and he will run away. Of
course, Wizrobe will fight you another day…  

#5
Name: Wizrobe –- The Return!
Description: An elderly man with pale blue skin. Dons magicians’ cloaks
and a magic wooden staff which he uses as a weapon. 

Attacks: A. Large Blasts of Ice Energy.

Strategy:
        Wizrobe has returned, and more mean then before. The room your
fighting in is twice as large as before, and Wizrobe can now warp
between seven energy tiles. Right after you enter the room, turn left
and run to this corner. This is the best spot to hit him. When he warps
to a tile, he will pause for a bit and spin around on top of it, holding
his staff above his head. This is your window of opportunity to hit him
with a arrow from you bow. After a few seconds, if you don’t hit him, he
will take aim with his staff and fire off a blast of blue ice energy at
you. If this occurs, run to another corner of the room and wait to aim
again. If you are hit by the energy, it will freeze you in ice along
with a large section of the floor, taking off one half a heart. After
three strikes from arrows, he will call in his Phanrobe friends again,
fake copies of himself. Ignore them and strike the real Wizrobe. He will
be the one not flying around the room. After three more arrows, he runs
away again, of course, challenging you another day.

- 2 Axe combo
Z-Target, hit with sword for a bit, move back. Repeat. 
Pissed-Off Mode:
-Axe strike lunges forward.

#1
Name: Odolwa, Masked Jungle Warrior 
Description: Giant humanoid creature bearing a large green shield and a
sword. Sprints around the room chanting his various war cries. He wears
the first guardian mask upon his face and paint markings adorn his body. 

Attacks: A. Huge Slashes with His Sword B. Calling Upon a Swarm of Swamp
Butterflies C. Summoning a Troop of Ground Critters D. Trapping Link
Within a Large Ring of Fire 

Difficulty: * * 

Strategy:
        Odolwa is fairly easy and decent, considering he is the first
real boss in the game. The key here is just keep it simple, just slash
him with your sword until he dies off. Don’t try fancy moves, for he
will only strike you away with his much larger sword of his own. Which
still only takes off one fourth a heart. 
        Odolwa sprints around the room chanting his “Due-Wah-Hewt” war
cry so run after him. Only approach him at an angle, never straight on.
Sometimes Odolwa will back flip over you and land on the other side of
arena, get in there and follow him. After about 3 slashes, he will cry
out “Hew-Wah-Ya-Die” and summon in a troop of small crab shaped insects
that scamper along the ground. Concentrate on this and kill them off,
then go back to fighting Odolwa again. They are quite a nuisance and
take off one fourth a heart every time they bump into you. 
        During the battle, a few times Odolwa will chant “Dah-Dae-Wah”
and try to overwhelm you from doing anything with a literal wall of
Swamp Butterflies. To remedy the situation, look to the edge of this
arena. Along the walls are some black and green bulbs. These are Bomb
Flowers. Go over to one and pick a Bomb fruit from it and chuck it away
from you. The Swamp Butterflies will swarm around the source of fire,
the lit fuse. It will explode and kill away the swarm. This is very
beneficial, for they leave a large and plentiful quantity of hearts. 
        If Odolwa happens to trap you within a large ring of fire, just
remain patience and wait for it to dissipate. After 15 slashes to him,
he will die off leaving behind a mask and Heart Container.


2#
Name: Goht, Masked Mechanical Monster
Description: 

Attacks: A. Galloping over Link. B. Kicking up Rocks. C. Causing 
Stalactites to Fall From the Ceiling. D. Shooting Ray Beams From his 
Head. E. Throwing Bombs at Link. 
 
Difficulty: *

Strategy:
        After Goht gallops away, duck right back into the alcove of the 
entrance door. Pull out your Hero’s Bow, and load in a fire arrow. Aim 
out into the room. Just wait for Goht to gallop by, then nail him with 
the arrow. He will be set ablaze and keep galloping past. This strategy 
is full-proof. I hope you don’t even get hit once. All Goht’s attacks 
can’t hurt you because your in the little alcove. After six strikes from 
arrows, he will make stalactites fall from the ceiling. After nine, he 
will begin shooting electrical ray beams from his head. And after a full 
ten hits, he will try to chuck bombs at you. Goht takes fifteen fire 
arrows to bring him down, he will leave behind a heart container and 
your second guardian mask.

Since there’s only four temple bosses in Majora’s Mask, that means you 
have to get 13 hearts on your health meter from Heart Pieces. If you do 
the math, that’s a whooping 52 Heart Pieces hidden throughout the game. 
Below is a complete list of all the pieces, in order by location. The 
thing in ()’s is the form of Link you must be in to get the Heart Piece, 
and []’s show what items are required. Some Heart Pieces take quite a 
lot of effort to get, while others even a simpleton with a blindfold on 
could find.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          C L O C K   T O W N
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. (Deku Scrub Link) [Moon Tear, Land Title Deed]

You should have gotten this Heart Piece the very first time through the 
three days, but here it is anyway. After you have gotten the Moon Tear 
from visiting Astral Observatory, head into South Clock Town. Go towards 
the yellow Deku flower next to the canal of water. A Deku Scrub Salesman 
will fly out of the air and tell you not to mess around with his private 
property. He is looking for a gift for his wife. Give him the Moon Tear, 
and he we give you the Land Title Deed in exchange. This gives you total 
ownership of the Deku Flower. Use the Deku Flower to fly up to the ledge 
on the Clock Tower and claim the Heart Piece.


2. (Link) [None]

Some people say you need the Bunny Hood for this piece, but that is not 
the case. First head into North Clock Town. Look for the balloon with 
the emblem of Majora’s Mask on it. From the balloon, there should be a 
small playground over to the right. Hop up the pillars to the top of the 
slide. Now jump across to the dead tree. Grab the Heart Piece sitting in 
its branches.


3. (Link) [5000 Rupees]

This one is really simple. All you have to do is deposit at least 5000 
Rupees into the Clock Town Bank to get the Heart Piece. The bank can be 
found in West Clock Town. You should be depositing rupees anyway, so 
getting this Heart Piece is like a bonus. Remember, each time you kill 
the Takkuri (that bird at the entrance to Milk Road) you get a Huge 
Rupee worth 200 Rupees. Make sure to be on Epona first though so the 
Takkuri can’t hurt you.  


4. (Link) [Land Title Deed*]

First, go get the Land Title Deed again. See the first Heart Piece if 
you forgot how. After you have the deed, wait till midnight. When the 
clock strikes 12, go to the Stock Pot Inn in East Clock Down. You’ll 
need to use the upstairs entrance via the Deku Flower, since the main 
entrance is closed at night. One inside Stock Pot Inn, make sure to be 
on the second floor. Head into the bathroom that’s across from the 
kitchen. A long thin arm will be reaching up from inside the actual 
toilet. He needs “toilet paper” but give him the Land Title Deed 
instead. You get a Heart Piece in exchange for your kindness.     

* Technically any paper item will work, like a letter, but the Land 
Title Deed is the easiest to find repeatedly.


5. (Link) [At least 200 Rupees]

First travel to East Clock Town. Enter the Shooting Gallery when its 
open, between the hours of 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM. The Shooting Gallery is 
the building with the big purple creature on it. Ask the owner to play 
the shooting game. It costs 20 Rupees per game, but believe me, you’ll 
be playing this a lot of times. When you finally earn a perfect score of 
50 points, the Heart Piece is yours. If you need even more help, check 
the mini-games section.  


6. (Deku Scrub Link) [At least 100 Rupees]

I really hate getting this Heart Piece because it takes so long. Go to 
North Clock Town. Over near the entrance to the Great Fairy Fountain 
will be a Deku Flower. Turn into Deku Scrub Link and flowercopter to the 
area enclosed by the brown fence. Fall in the hole. This is the Deku 
Scrub Playground. Ask the Deku Scrub to play the obstacle course for  
the price of 10 Rupees. You have to play the obstacle course and beat 
the current record everyday of the three days. After you do this, the 
Deku Scrub will award you a Heart Piece. This one is a pain in the neck.


7. (Link) [Bombchus, Bomb Bag, Hero’s Bow, 60 Rupees]

Just 60 Rupees should be needed to get this Heart Piece, because you 
have to beat three mini-games that cost 20 Rupees each. They’re easy, so 
shame on you if you lose. During the daytime, go to East Clock Town and 
enter the Honey and Darling Shop. Play and win at the mini-game on each 
of the three days. Day one has Bombchu Bowling, day two is Bombsket 
Ball, and on day three they have Target Practice. After you win at all 
the games, they present you with the award of a Heart Piece. 


8. (Link) [At least 30 Rupees]

This Heart Piece is difficult to get, but for all the wrong reasons. It 
basically just takes blind luck more then skill to get the piece. 
Firstly, you’ll need to go over to the Clock Town Postal Office either 
on the first or second day. Not the final day. The office is located 
just across from the Lottery Shop in West Clock Town. Hang around inside 
till around 7:00 AM when the Mailman runs his slow body inside and sits 
on the bed.  


9. (Link) [Couple’s Mask]

First go over to East Clock Town. Enter the Mayor’s Residence and then 
into his office. A big argument is going on between the mayor, the 
soldiers, and the carnival workers. Put on your Couple’s Mask and talk 
to the mayor. It’s soothing effects will end the argument and he will 
give you a Heart Piece as thanks. 


10. (Link) [Keaton Mask]

Put on the Keaton Mask then travel to North Clock Town. Head over to the 
slide and there will be a patch of bushes on the ground beside it. Cut 
down all of the bushes before they disappear -- since they will try to 
scurry away. After they’re all gone, a yellow three-tailed fox will 
appear. This is Keaton. The fox will ask you five random questions about 
the game. Answer them all correctly to get the Heart Piece. 


11. (Link) [Kamaro’s Mask] 

Once you have gotten the Kamaro’s Mask, wait for nighttime. Head to West 
Clock Town and you will find two ladies in white dresses dancing in 
front of the Lottery Shop. These are the Rosa Sisters. Put on the 
Kamaro’s Mask and dance in front of them. In gratitude for showing them 
your inspiring dance, they will give you a Heart Piece.   


12. (Link) [All-Night Mask]

During the daytime, go to East Clock Town and enter the Stock Pot Inn. 
Put on your All-Night Mask then visit Anju’s Grandmother. She’s the one 
in the wheelchair. Have her read to you the first story in the list 
about the carnival. When she asks you the question, answer “On the eve 
of the carnival” and you will get a Heart Piece. If you wondering what 
the All-Night Mask was for, it’s so you don’t fall asleep while 
listening to the story. Haha. 


13. (Link) [All-Night Mask]

This is just like the previous Heart Piece. Put on your All-Night Mask 
and talk to Anju’s Grandmother. But this time, have her read to you the 
story about the four giants. When she asks you the question, answer “I 
don’t know” even though you do know. She’ll give you the Heart Piece 
just for listening to her. This one fooled me for awhile.

RUPEE QUOTES

“You got a Huge Rupee! Just one is worth 200 Rupees! That’s a big deal!”

“You got a Silver Rupee! It’s worth 100 Rupees! You’re pretty happy!”

“You got a Purple Rupee! It’s worth 50 Rupees! Your face is beaming!”

“You got a Red Rupee! It’s worth 20 Rupees! That’s pretty nice!”

“You got a Blue Rupee! It’s worth 5 Rupees! That’s not too shabby...” 

“You got a Green Rupee! That’s worth one Rupee!” 


HUGE RUPEES (gold) [200]

1 - If you kill the Takkuri vulture, it leaves behind a Huge Rupee. The 
Takkuri can be seen in Termina Field flying around the entrance to Milk 
Road. Hop on Epona the horse and take out the Takkuri using arrows. Make 
sure that the Takkuri ISN’T directly flying over the Milk Road entrance 
when it drops the Huge Rupee, or you wouldn’t be able to collect it. 
It’s very annoying when that happens. 

2 -


SILVER RUPEES [100]

1 - First enter into East Clock Town. Go over to the entrance to Astral 
Observatory and give the Bomber Kid the code. Enter into the sewers. 
Travel down the tunnel to the first chamber. Head left following the 
stream. At the end near the gate will be a small area with cracked wall. 
Blow it up with a bomb and it will expose a small chamber with a 
treasure chest. Open it to collect a Silver Rupee. The best part about 
this one is you can keep collecting this rupee over and over again if 
you enter and exit the sewers. 

2 - To get this one, you must first have collected the Bunny Hood. Head 
over to East Clock Town. Go to the top of the building with the straw 
roof and the Bomber Kid pacing back and forth. Now put on your Bunny 
Hood, and hop across the gap, a Clock Town exit should be below. Hop the 
next gap using the two targets connected to the shop as platforms. Once 
you pass over the two gaps, just follow this corridor on top of the 
buildings. At the end you should come to a treasure chest. Open it up to 
get a Silver Rupee. 

PURPLE RUPEES [50]

1 - Head to Termina Field during the daytime, then over to the entrance 
of the northern mountains. Several giant lizards called Dodongos will be 
walking around on the ground. Kill each one to get a Purple Rupee.

2 - 

RED RUPEES [20]

1 -  After it becomes nighttime, head to the Laundry Pool in Clock Town. 
At the bottom of the moat will be three Red Rupees for you to collect. 

2 -  In Termina Field, go towards the Astral Observatory building. Just 
outside the perimeter fence will be a man climbing a tree trying to 
reach two Red Rupees in the tree’s branches. Turn into Goron Link then 
pound the ground at the base of the tree. The man and both Red Rupees 
will fall to the ground. Collect them.  

3 - Enter into Termina Field then travel over to the entrance to Great 
Bay. Over to the left against the wall will be a small lake of water 
with a treasure chest at the bottom. Turn into Zora Link and sink to the 
bottom to where the chest is. Open it to claim a single Red Rupee.

4 - Enter Termina Field via the exit in South Clock Town. Head forward 
between the wooden pillars towards Southern Swamp like you normally 
would. Except, at the end of the pillars, veer left and head through the 
thick grass. In the corner you should see the top of a treasure chest 
peeking up above the grass. Open it to get a Red Rupee. 

5 - After you have defeated the Snowhead Temple boss Goht, and it’s 
springtime in the mountains again, travel to the Mountain Village. 
Across from the wooden cabin is a waterfall. Go behind it, and you will 
find a suspicious empty chamber. Equip your Lens of Truth and look 
around in the small chamber. You will see a treasure chest. Open it up 
and rechieve a single Red Rupee.

This tidbit is similar to the one in the previous game, Ocarina of Time. 
If you chop up a wooden sign with your sword, the pieces will fall to 
the ground. Play the Song of Healing and the broken sign pieces will 
magically float back and reconnect together.

#2  FLOATING PIECES    

If you chop up a wooden sign next to a body of water, any broken pieces 
that fall into the water will float. I know, this tidbit is lame, but 
work with me people...

#3  VITAMIN D

This one is a nice little Easter egg. While defending the shipment of 
Romani Milk on the wagon from the pursuing bandits, wear the Circus 
Leader’s Mask. The bandits wouldn’t even try attacking! This is because 
they’re obvious the Gorman Brothers in disguise, and the Circus Leader’s 
Mask resembles a Gorman brother. What were the bandits thinking when 
they armed themselves which pitchforks anyway?   

#4  SAKON SIGHTING

Good old Sakon the thief. He’s actually not that crafty of a thief, but 
annoying none the less. On the first day, you can find him hiding behind 
the slide in North Clock Town at around 11:00 PM. He’s of course waiting 
to mug the old woman with the Bomb Bag... that punk. That annoying grin 
makes me want to vomit too. 
  
#5  SECOND SAKON SIGHTING

Wait till after Sakon the thief steals the Bomb Bag from the old lady --
at 12:00 PM on the first day in North Clock Town. Occasionally in the 
middle of the night on the first day, you can see Sakon running with the 
Bomb Bag on his back into the Curiosity Shop in West Clock Town. Go in 
after him, and you can even talk with him. He’ll tell you that the 
Curiosity Shop owner is price gouging him when buying his stolen goods! 

#6  FINAL SAKON SIGHTING

During the daytime, you can sometimes see Sakon the thief prancing 
around in a circle next to the river in Ikana Canyon. If you walk up to 
him, Tatl will glow strangely red over his head. He compliments how nice 
your pretty sword is... so pretty... Whatever you do, say “no” when he 
asks to see your sword. If you give it to him, he will run off with it! 
Not like you’d ACTUALLY fall for that, right?

#7  DOUBLE MOON

This tidbit is entirely useless, but pretty funny. First go over to the 
Astral Observatory on the first day. Talk to the owner wearing the blue 
magician’s tunic and say “yes” to look through the telescope. Now focus 
up at the Moon. The Moon Tear will fall down as usual, except the 
telescope then focuses on the Clock Tower summit where Skull Kid is 
standing. He then turns around, moons you, and hops away. How rude!

#8  ENEMIES SUPER-SIZED

No, not like at McDonalds. *music* Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, 
special sau... *slaps self*

To even get a chance to wage your war against the ghosts, you’re going 
to need to arrive at Romani Ranch no later then 8:00 PM on the first 
day. Getting there on time entails getting a 100-rupee Powder Keg from 
the Giant Goron in Goron Village, and blowing up the boulder blocking 
the entrance to Romani Ranch. 

After you’ve accessed the ranch, just head towards the two cabins in the 
center of the field. Near the cabins you’ll immediately spot see a 
wooden crate with a red balloon thing floating on it. Nearby is a girl 
with red hair. (Same girl who was Malon in the Ocarina of Time) Go over 
and talk to her. She will ask you who you are, and that she is Romani, 
named after the ranch. Just tell Romani your name, whatever name you 
entered at the beginning when you chose your game. Romani will instead 
call you Grasshopper. This is due to the green clothes that you’re 
wearing and the way you patter when you walk.

Romani then speaks seriously. “Romani was practicing... For tonight... 
Tonight... They are coming...” The screen now goes into a cinema scene. 
“They... They come at night... every year when the carnival approaches.” 
The funniest line is when “And then... The come to the barn...” and it 
shows a cow being abducted. After the scene wraps up, Romani tells you 
that she is looking for a partner to get rid of these ghosts. Say “yes” 
when she asks if you want to practice. 

All you have to do now is shoot 10 ghost-shaped balloons. You have 
unlimited arrows, and 2 minutes to do it. Meaning, this is extremely 
easy. The screen fades out. Now just ride around on Epona shooting all 
the balloons with arrows. The balloons can be scattered around anywhere 
in the field. God this is easy... 

After your finished shooting all 10 balloons, Romani will compliment on 
how well you and Epona work together. Romani then tells you that the 
ghosts only come at night, and flee at the first sight of the sun. You 
must keep them from getting in the barn or else we lose. The operation 
starts at 2:00 AM in the morning. Finish speaking with Romani. 

Firstly, make sure to go around the ranch chopping down bushes to get as 
many arrows as you can carry. When you have that done, get out your 
Ocarina of Time. Play the Inverted Song of Time and bring the flow of 
time back to normal speed. This way, the sun will come up quicker and 
less ghosts will appear. Now play the Song of Double Time, and warp to 
the night of the first day. It should be 12:00 PM. Just run around or 
something... look at the moon maybe. Just wait till 2:00 AM. Make sure 
not to be riding on Epona the Horse. This makes fighting the aliens 
harder. When 2:00 PM rolls around... 

Romani will walk into the barn. Just wait until exactly 2:30 PM. Romani 
cries “They came!!!” All of a sudden, orange spheres pop out of the sky 
and the ghosts land at all places in the field. Wow, that’s some freaky 
music that plays. This is it, the battle has begun!

OK, this is how it works. Have Link just run around the barn on the 
ground. Shoot each alien with one arrow and it will disappear. Do not 
let the aliens get near the barn! And watch out, there are two aliens 
that come at the barn from the back. Make sure they don’t sneak by. If 
you run out of arrows, even though you shouldn’t, there is a patch of 
bushes behind the barn. When the sun first comes up, the aliens 
disappear into thin air.

You have won! Romani rewards you with a bottle filled with some fresh 
Romani Milk for your efforts. Mooooooo! All in a days work ma’am! Now 
where’s your wallet... :P

This side quest is extremely short, but I made a section for it due to 
the 30 possible questions Keaton may ask you. First you must have gotten 
the Keaton Mask. Check the masks section on everything about that. After 
you have it, go to North Clock Town. Next to the stone slide and against 
the wall will be a patch of green bushes. Make sure to first wear your 
Keaton Mask! Slash some of the bushes with your sword and the rest of 
them will strangely try to “scurry” away. Kill every last bush and 
Keaton will appear out of no where. Keaton is a yellow fox creature with 
three tails and strangely resembles Ninetails the Pokemon... Keaton says

After you’ve correctly answered all five of Keaton’s simple questions, 
he will award you a Heart Piece for your success. Keaton then disappears 
into thin air like some cheap sideshow magician.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       D O N   G E R O   F R O G S
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Even though assembling all five of the Don Gero frogs at the Mountain 
Village just gets you another Heart Piece, tracking all of them down 
takes enough work to consider it a separate side quest. A few of them 
are irritating to get, so the tips written below should let you find the 
frogs with as minimal effort as possible. To speak to a frog, first put 
on your Don Gero Mask then just speak like you would to any other 
character.


FIRST FROG: You can find this first frog lackey hanging out next to the 
tree in the Laundry Pool in Clock Town.

SECOND FROG: For this one, just warp to Southern Swamp using the owl 
statue. Turn into Deku Scrub Link and hop along the trail of Lilly Pads. 
The trail that starts at the left side of the Tourist Information 
building and ends near the entrance to the Deku Palace with the Octoroon 
blocking the way. The frog is on the log. 

THIRD FROG: Warp to the Woodfall owl statue, then as Deku Scrub Link 
access the Woodfall Temple. Since you already have the Hero’s Bow, you 
can easily access the second floor of the temple. Go to the room where 
Gekko is (the room where you got the Boss Key) and fight him. After he’s 
beaten, he reverts to a plain frog.

FOURTH FROG: You have to fight and beat the second Gekko in Great Bay 
Temple to find this frog. Access the Great Bay Temple like your normally 
would, then make your way to the chamber where the Boss Key is. Use your 
Ice Arrows to get across the water to where Gekko lurks. Defeat it and 
talk to the fourth frog. 

FINAL FROG: Since you’ve already talked to the previous four frogs, just 
warp to Snowhead and access the Snowhead Temple. Warp to the boss room 
then defeat Goht, Masked Mechanical Monster. After he’s gone, Goron 
Country reverts back to springtime and Link warps to the Mountain 
Village -- right in front of the chorus of the five frogs on Lilly pads.
 

Talk to the five frogs with your Don Gero Mask on. Conduct the frog 
chorus and they will be so impressed they give you a heart piece! And so 
ends this ludicrous quest.

This isn’t really much of a side quest, but I put it in here anyway due 
to the fact that Ultimate Blue Potion can be extremely valuable when 
fighting bosses. It fully recovers BOTH hearts and magic energy so it’s 
always good to know where to find some. I’ve babbled on long enough, so 
here’s how you get the blue stuff... 

First, you must have collected the Mask of Scents from the Deku Butler. 
Check the mask section on how to collect it if you haven’t already. Once 
you have the mask, head to the Southern Swamp. Put on your Mask of 
Scents and Link will sniff around in the air a bit. What this does is 
allows you to see the scent clouds of the rare Odd Mushroom. 

There are two easy locations to find the Odd Mushroom. One is against 
the wall right next to the Southern Swamp Owl Statue. The other is in 
the passageway leading to the Old Hag’s Potion Shop. Take an empty 
bottle out of your inventory and put it on a C button. Swing the bottle 
at the pink scent cloud and an Odd Mushroom will end up in the bottle.
Once you have an Odd Mushroom in your possession, head over to the Old 
Hag’s Potion Shop. Give the Odd Mushroom to Kotake the witch behind the 
counter. She can now begin making the Ultimate Blue Potion.  

After she’s finished making the potion, you get an Ultimate Blue Potion 
for free! Not only that, you can buy as many of the potions as you want 
for 60 Rupees each. Of course, if you warp back in time, you have to 
deliver the mushroom all over again. Bon appetite!

CLOCK TOWN: The owl statue can easily be found near the wooden ramps and 
along the wall of the left side of the Clock Tower. 

SOUTHERN SWAMP: After entering Southern Swamp from the south exit of 
Termina Field, you can find this statue tucked in the corner to the 
right of the Tourist Information building. 

WOODFALL: In Woodfall, after making your way across the wooden planks 
and stone pieces, you come to the final platform -- a small wooden dock 
with a Deku Scrub pedestal. The statue is on this dock in plain sight.

MOUNTAIN VILLAGE: The cabin is the main focal point in the very center 
of the Mountain Village. From the cabin, head across the river and you 
should see the statue up against the wall.

SNOWHEAD: This statue is at the very beginning of Snowhead, before the 
long thin ice catwalk with the giant Goron. It’s sitting next to the 
wall on the right.  

MILK ROAD: Right when you enter Milk Road you can spot this statue dead 
ahead against the left wall... unless your blind that is.

GREAT BAY: From the beach shoreline, swim out into the ocean to where 
the Marine Research Laboratory is. That’s the fish hook shaped building. 
The statue is on a small wooden dock below the building.  

ZORA CAPE: In Zora Hall, find the open corridor with the two ramps on 
the first floor. Exit through the ramp on the left. Outside is a small 
patch of land. The statue is on the left.

IKANA CANYON: Cross the huge river using the Ice Arrows and Hookshot, 
then find the statue right next to the dead brown tree at the edge of 
the cliff.  

STONE TOWER: Make your way up the Stone Tower. That’s the place with the 
huge open pit at the bottom, large boulders, and switches to be pressed 
using your dummy-doubles with the Elegy of Emptiness. At the top is the 
statue near the entrance to Stone Tower Temple.

Yes, I admit it. It has happened to me... And probably to every player 
at one time or another when playing Majora’s Mask. I only wish I had 
taken Tatl’s warning seriously of the danger. That dang Takkuri vulture, 
AKA flying rat stole a valuable item from you. Never fear, this section 
has been made specifically to help, if not remedy, that situation.


KNOW THE FOE!!!


What is this infamous Takkuri people talk about? Well it is a simple 
vulture. About the size of Link, with beady white eyes. He steals items 
from you, very valuable ones at that. I have heard complaints of stolen 
Hero’s Shields, up to Fairy Swords! This is the most menacing enemy in 
the game. But fortunately, there is only one of them to worry about, 
buzzing around the entrance to Milk Road.  


AVOIDANCE


Avoidance is the first line of defense. Being a coward can sometimes 
help you! Especially in this situation. Just avoiding the situation from 
ever happening is the best solution to the problem. Avoid the entrance 
to Milk Road, you only need to pass through there once. That is until 
you have activated the owl statue in Milk Road itself, then you can just 
warp and bypass the Takkuri flying around entirely. 


PREVENTION


If you do actually happen to find yourself hanging around the entrance 
to Milk Road, like say to kill the Takkuri to get a Huge Rupee, there 
are two different ways to protect yourself from the evil incarnate:

- Wear your Stone Mask! If the Takkuri can’t see you, it can’t attack!

- Ride on Epona. The horse keeps the Takkuri from attacking you.

In either of those cases, you might as well be invincible against the 
Takkuri since it never steals anything when you have one of those two 
safeguards activated. 


GETTING BACK YOUR STOLEN ITEMS

      
I can see you thinking it now. “What happens if the Takkuri does in 
fact, happen to steal item from me?” Well luckily, he only takes one 
item at a time, then flies away. Most people believe that since he has 
flown away, it is for good and there no possible way to get the item(s) 
back. This is untrue and I intend to teach you two different methods to 
get them back.

One nice little trick to get back your items is simply play the Song of 
Time. That’s right, just warp back to the dawn of the first day and your 
stolen items will be returned. Unfortunately, sometimes you CAN’T warp 
back to the dawn of the first day because you’re waiting for some time 
event or trading sequence. In that case...
 
When the Takkuri steals an item from you, he will swoop up into the sky 
and start to fly away. Watch carefully and you will notice it travels 
right to Clock Town. You can buy back, yes buy back, your stolen items 
from the clerk at the Curiosity Shop. Be warned, he will of course try 
to price gouge you from all your worth. I mean, he did ask for 500 
Rupees to buy that totally pathetic All-Night Mask. 


UH-OH, IS THERE ANY OTHER STRATEGIES BESIDES THOSE?


If you can’t get back your valuables with either of the above methods, 
then you’re pretty much on your own. I really can’t help you. You can
only go back to the appropriate place you got the item, and earn it back
again. Or just shut off the game. Other then that, nothing. Nadda.

****************************
GETTING THE GREAT FAIRY MASK
****************************

        To earn the Great Fairy Mask, you need to return the Stray Fairy
back to the Great Fairy Fountain. However, you must do this after you
have been turned back into normal Link. The fairy will grant you the
mask as a token of her thanks. The Stray Fairy can be found floating
around the Laundry Pool during the day, and in East Clock Town at night.

***************
WOODFALL TEMPLE

Fairy Color: Bright Pink
Thing Earned: 360-degree Spin Slash Upgrade for your sword 

        Make sure you beat the temple boss Odolwa first before going
after each of the fairies. This is because you will be confused with the
instructions if you do not, and some items are required to get them all.
Begin right at the entrance of the temple. Use the map below to identify
the locations of the fairies and the order in which you should get them.
Below the map is detailed instruction on how to get each fairy.

F1 to F15 - The Stray Fairy locations, which are numbered in the order
that you should try to find them.
========================================================================

--- Detailed Instructions ---

Fairy #1: 
When you first enter into Woodfall Temple, look straight ahead into the
room. You will see a fairy floating in the air. Put on your Great Fairy
Mask and collect it when to comes to you. 

Fairy #2: 
When you first enter into Woodfall Temple, look to your right side and
there will be a platform with a treasure chest in it. To get over to it,
just start with the Deku Flower next to you and follow the Deku Flowers
on over to the chest. Open it up to receive the fairy. 

Fairy #3: 
Right when you enter into the second chamber, the Woodfall Temple Altar
Room, change into Deku Link. Turn and run to your right and run off the
edge of this dirt area. Skip along the water down here over to a stone
area with five pots on it. Break the pot closest to the corner and
collect your third fairy. 

Fairy #4: 
This chamber is the next on, located on the right side of the altar room
on the map. When you first enter, you will see a Deku Flower on a small
island. Look over to your left, you will see an area with a treasure
chest. On the left of that small structure, look on the wall. You will
see and ever so small brown bees nest attached to it. Take off your Deku
Mask. Aim at with your bow and shoot and arrow hitting it. It will fall
to the water and shatter, the fairy being released. Put on your Great
Fairy Mask and collect it.

Fairy #5: 
Exit the previous chamber and back into the Woodfall Temple Altar Room.
Go to the other side of the room, where the door requiring the Silver
Key used to be. There is a Deku Baba on this little dirt area before the
door. Kill it off to get the fairy.

Fairy #6: 
Enter in this next room via the door next to the now killed Deku Baba.
Run up to the granite block and push it forward. Go to your right and
down the catwalks. Go along the walls till you reach a torch in the
corner of the room. A Skulltula will drop down from the ceiling. Kill it
off to get your sixth fairy.

Fairy #7: 
In this same room, look at the center of it, where the granite block is
currently. Below it in the water will be a fairy trapped in a bubble.
Jump down into the water below and swim over to it. Swim up next to the
bubble and rub against it for it to pop. Collect the fairy inside of it
using your Great Fairy Mask.

Fairy #8: 
Travel back to the entrance of the room. Stop right in front of the door
and face out into he room. Get out your bow and aim upwards. You will
see the bottom side of two platforms. On the one nearest you, take
notice of that small brown lump, another bee’s nest. Fire and arrow to
knock it down. It will shatter on the water releasing another fairy. Use
the Great Fairy Mask to collect your prize. 

Fairy #9: 
In this room will the catwalks, go over to the granite block, turn left
at it this time and head down to the end, go up the stairs here. Hop
along the platforms and up another go forward and up another set of
stairs. Your in a dark hallway. Travel down it to the darkened room.
Kill every Black Boe in here and a chest will materialize. Open it up to
get the fairy. 

Fairy #10: 
Exit out of the room by means of door. In this next room, hop along the
Deku Flower and exit at the staircase at the end. You come out in the
Woodfall Temple Altar Room again, except on the high ledge. Turn to your
right and run down to the end. A fairy will be trapped in a bubble in
plain site. Pop the bubble and collect it. 

Fairy #11: 
Look off the ledge and down, you will see a tree branch with a lit torch
and a button on it. Run over to your left and use the Deku Flower right
near you. Glide over to the small tree branch and press the button. A
chest well appear clear on the other side of the room. Go open the chest
and collect the fairy.

Fairy #12: 
Get back up to the ledge in the Woodfall Temple Altar Room again. Except
this time enter in the chamber right before the bosses room. Fall down
from the ladder and use the Deku Flower here. Turn to your right. Glide
up to the first ledge here and a fairy will be trapped in another
bubble. Pop the bubble and collect it. 

Fairy #13: 
Glide up the rest of the ledges and at the highest one will be another
fairy in a bubble. Pop it and collect the fairy.

Fairy #14: 
Go back down to the Deku Flower next to the ladder. This time, instead
of traveling to the ledges to your right, use the flower and glide to
the first ledge to your left. Go up all the ledges and at the top of
will be yet again, another fairy trapped within a bubble. Pop it for it
to be released. Collect the fairy.

Fairy #15: 
I say good job if your here reading this! This is the last fairy in
Woodfall Temple. It is located on the top of the first pillar will
flames on top. Turn the flames off by hitting the switch again. Use the
Deku Flowers and fly over to it.

        After you have collected the fifteenth fairy, a box will pop up
on screen. “You’ve found all the Stray Fairies! Quick, take them to the
fairies of the same color.”

--- Great Fairy Fountain Location For Woodfall Temple ---

        The Great Fairy Fountain is very easy to find here. Simply warp
to the owl statue located in Woodfall. You will reappear on the small
wooden platform facing the owl statue. Look past the owl statue and to 
the left on the back wall there. That dark cavern is the Fairy’s 
Fountain. Use the Lilly-Pads and Deku Flowers to reach it.

13.) So, That Vulture Stole Your Valuable Item(s)?
========================================================================

        Yes, it has happened to me. And probably to everyone at one time
or another when playing Majora’s Mask. I only wish I had taken Tatl’s 
warning seriously of the danger. That darned Takkuri, AKA vulture, stole
a valuable item from you. Never fear, this section has been made
specifically to help, if not remedy, that situation.

****KNOW THE FOE****
        What is this infamous Takkuri people talk about? Well it is a
simple vulture. About the size of Link, with beady white eyes. He steals
items from you, very valuable ones at that. I have heard complaints of
stolen Hero’s Shields, up to Fairy Swords! This is the most menacing
enemy in the game. But fortunately, there is only one of them to worry
about, buzzing around the entrance to Milk Road.  

****AVOIDING****
        Just avoiding the situation from ever happening is the best
solution to the problem. Avoid the entrance to Milk Road, you only need
to pass through there once. That is until you have activated the owl
statue in Milk Road itself, then you can just warp and bypass the
Takkuri flying around. 

****PREVENTION****
        If you do happen to find yourself hanging around the entrance to
Milk Road, like say to kill the Takkuri, make sure to be on Epona the
Horse. When you’re are on horseback, the Takkuri never dares to swoop
down on you. You are totally invincible from it. 

****GETTING BACK YOUR STOLEN ITEMS****      
        What happens if the Takkuri does in fact, happen to steal
item(s) from me? Well luckily, he only takes one item at a time, then
flies away. Most people believe that since he has flown away, it is for
good and there no possible way to get the item(s) back. This is untrue
and I intend to teach you how to get them back.
        The best way, meaning the most practical and easiest, is to just
turn off the game. That is right, just turn off your game and restart it
to where you last saved. Then you don’t have to go through any trouble.
But if can’t do that without serious consequences, then look below. 
        When the Takkuri steals an item from you, he will swoop up into
the sky and start to fly away. Watch carefully and you will notice it
travels right to Clock Town. You can buy back, yes buy back, your stolen
items from the clerk at the Curiosity Shop. Be warned, he will of course
try to price gouge you from all your worth. I mean, he did ask for 500
Rupees to buy that below average All-Night Mask. 

****GETTING BACK THE ITEMS, WHEN YOU CAN’T BUY THEM****
        Well your pretty much on your own. If you can’t buy back the
items from the Curiosity Shop, then I really can’t help you. You can
only go back to the appropriate place you got the item, and earn it back
again. It is time consuming, but you probably need it to beat the game
and it is all to add challenge to the game.

  26.   O C A R I N A   S O N G S


========================================================================


This section is for all those lazy people out there who don’t feel like 
memorizing all the songs and are constantly checking the song staff on 
the status screen. Two small things to remember when reading the notes 
on these songs:

- C-U = camera up, C-D = camera down, ect. 
- (A) means the A button.

Other then that, it’s fairly straight forward and should be no trouble. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           S O N G S   L I S T
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Song of Time
----------------------------
C-U, (A), C-D, C-R, (A), C-D
----------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:

Play the Song of Time and Link will be able to save his game and warp 
back to the dawn of the first day. All replenishable items in your 
inventory will be lost however. 

WHERE IT’S LEARNED:

You learn the Song of Time from a memory flashback when you get back 
your Ocarina of Time from Skull Kid at the top of the Clock Tower. Which 
is basically, almost immediately in the game. 


2. Song of Double Time
----------------------------
C-U, C-U, (A), (A), C-D, C-D
----------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:

Playing the Song of Double Time allows Link to warp ahead half a day. In 
other words, from night to morning, or morning to night.

WHERE IT’S LEARNED:

This song really isn’t “learned” per say, but you’re given the hint of 
how to play it from the scarecrow living in the basement of the Astral 
Observatory. All it is the first half of the Song of Time doubled.


3. Inverted Song of Time
----------------------------
C-D, (A), C-R, C-D, (A), C-U
----------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:

One of the most used songs in the game, it allows Link to change the 
speed of time. Either slowing it down (doubling how long a minute is) or 
speeding it back up to normal.

WHERE IT’S LEARNED:

Like the Song of Double Time, the Scarecrow in Astral Observatory just 
drops hints on how to play this game. Needless to say, this is just the 
Song of Time except the notes are reversed.


4. Song of Healing 
----------------------------
C-L, C-R, C-D, C-L, C-R, C-L
----------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:

The notes in this song have special soothing powers which can help calm 
and people in distress. Play it for certain characters in need to heal 
them and get a transformational mask.

WHERE IT’S LEARNED:

After you retrieve the Ocarina of Time from Skull Kid, go visit the 
Happy Mask Trader in the Clock Tower basement. He will be pleased with 
your efforts (even though he doesn’t realize you haven’t fulfilled your 
promise and haven’t recovered Majora’s Mask) and teach you the song.  


5. Song of Soaring
----------------------------
C-D, C-L, C-U, C-D, C-L, C-U
----------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:

Play this song and you can warp to any owl statue in the land of Termina 
that you have activated with your sword. You take off in a bundle of 
feathers when warping. 

WHERE IT’S LEARNED:

Learn this song from the old wise owl. From the Deku Palace, take the 
shortcut to Woodfall that only Deku Scrubs can access. Next to the 
waterfall you’ll find the owl along with a gray stone tablet – this has 
the inscription of the song on it.

 
6. Sonata of Awakening
---------------------------------
C-U, C-L, C-U, C-L, (A), C-R, (A)
---------------------------------

USE OF THE SONG:



7. Lullaby Intro (becomes Goron Lullaby after you learn the ending)
----------------------------
(A), C-R, C-L, (A), C-R, C-L
----------------------------


8. Goron Lullaby
--------------------------------------
(A), C-R, C-L, (A), C-R, C-L, C-R, (A)
--------------------------------------


9. New Wave Bossa Nova
---------------------------------
C-L, C-U, C-L, C-R, C-D, C-L, C-R
---------------------------------


10. Elegy of Emptiness
---------------------------------
C-L, C-R, C-L, C-D, C-L, C-U, C-R

11. Oath to Order

YOU DECIDE.

  27.   F R E Q U E N T L Y   A S K E D   Q U E S T I O N S


========================================================================


Q: After the three days were up, the moon crashed and I died. What 
should I have done?

A: You DO realize that you CAN get your Ocarina of Time back, right? Use 
it to warp back to the dawn of the first day and save your game before 
you die from the lunar crash.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What? My horse Epona was stolen! How do I get her back?
   
A: Yes it sucks, but you CAN get Epona back. Read the “Getting Back 
Epona” section of the guide. I made that for a reason. I myself thought 
it was rather obvious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can I change into the adult form of Link in Majora’s Mask?

A: Sorry, you cannot in this game. However, there really is no need to. 
The child form of link retains all the skills of his adult form. Plus, 
he runs faster, is more agile, and jumps over larger pits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: YOU CAN turn into adult form of Link! From the Fierce Deity’s Mask!

A: What? Sigh... that isn’t adult Link you nitwit. That’s Fierce Deity 
Link AKA Oni Link. Hence the name of the mask -- “Fierce Deity.” Well, 
maybe you consider it adult link, since it’s the same polygon model with 
upgraded graphics... delude yourself if you wish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is there anyway I can store replenishing items so there not lost when 
I travel back in time?

A: No, there is no way to do this. Replenishing items like Deku Nuts, 
Bombs, and Arrows ect. cannot be stored. The only exception to this is 
with Rupees, which may be deposited in the West Clock Town Bank. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Where is the bank in West Clock Town?!? I keep looking everywhere!

A: Well the bank isn’t exactly a building per say, maybe that’s where 
people get confused. The bank is the small alcove in the wall, with the 
owner on his hands an knees on the counter. Took me a little while to 
find it too, so don’t worry about it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Say what? The game only lasts three days? Do I have to beat and get 
everything possible in that amount of time?

A: No no no! This is a mistake. Yes, there is only a three day time 
period -- in game time. You play through the three days living up to the 
lunar crash. But, you can keep replaying those three days as long as you 
need to beat the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: If you keep replaying the same three days over and over again, does 
that get redundant and boring?

A: Only if you completely suck at the game. Even though you do in fact 
keep replaying the same three days over again, you get to access new 
areas in the world with the special items you find in your travels. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I save my game, I’m confused...

A: Well... you could help yourself and actually read the game basics 
section of this guide, but I’ll just tell you here. There are two ways 
to save your game. Using the Ocarina of Time and warping back to the 
dawn of the first day, or using an in-game save with an owl statue. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What’s an owl statue?

A: Oh dear God... have you even played the game? Check the game basics 
section for this simpleton information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What is this “ultimate three day challenge” thing about?

A: The ultimate challenge -- beat all of Majora’s Mask up to the final 
boss and defeat him. Only one catch, do it without returning to the dawn 
of the first day at all! Extremely challenging. You an go to the 
Majora’s Mask boards on GameFAQs for more info...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: But that’s impossible! You can’t do this three day challenge! What 
about all the masks, items, heart pieces, ect.?

A: No you fool, you just do the bare minimum needed to get to the final 
boss and defeat him. That way, you DO have enough time. THAT’S what the 
challenge is. Did you even look into this?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Which is better, Ocarina of Time or Majora’s Mask? 

A: I really couldn’t answer that for you. Play through both of them and 
make your own decision. However, it’s not really fair to compare them. 
Sure the game engine is the same, but there both very unique in there 
different styles of gameplay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I beat Snowhead Temple?

A: *shifts in chair*... It’s in this thing called a “walkthrough.” You 
know about that right? Go do this thing called “reading.” Reading is 
fundamental! You do know what reading is right?!? I don’t just write 
these things for the awesome amount of money I get. (i.e. NONE!) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Ah crap! That stupid vulture near the entrance to Milk Road stole 
[insert item here] from me! What should I do?

Answer: See my section “Takkuri Bird Strategy” in this guide. It will 
hopefully solve your problems. That stupid vulture made me a victim 
too... Now I just hop on Epona and kill it any chance I get for revenge.
Ain’t life sweet?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I can’t get through the Pinnacle Rock area located in Great Bay. That 
underwater sandstorm always carries me away. Any solutions?

A: Yea, that puzzled me at first too. There are two ways to do it:

(Easy) You can get a special yellow sea horse. This guy will be your 
guide for the correct path underwater through Pinnacle Rock. You can get 
the sea horse from the fisherman in the building on shore. He’ll give 
you the sea horse in exchange for a pictograph of a Gerudo Pirate. I 
DON’T want to know what he actually does with it...

(Hard) Simple Trial and Error. Keep going a little farther in the path 
each time. This could take awhile though, and it’s very annoying. 
Probably better just to swallow your pride and get the fish guide. Hey, 
that rhymed!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Where is the Pirates’ Fortress? I can’t find it anywhere.

A: It’s pretty hard to navigate around that ocean. From shore, head out 
the laboratory out in the water. Out here, swim to the right until you 
come to a small lagoon. Go underwater through those wooden boards with 
the skull and cross bones on them. Break them with Zora Link’s torpedo 
move thing. I can’t remember the name of that move, forgive me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I tried to get into Romani Ranch but there’s a big boulder in the 
way. How do I get past it?

A: Urge to kill, rising... It’s in the frikkin’ walkthrough boy! You can 
blow it up with a Powder Keg or just wait for it to be removed by a 
worker on the third day.

PS: I should have said boy/girl. Women can be stupid as well, so forgive 
me for my racism... Although I like to think women are stupid more of 
the time... hehe. :P

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I get the heart piece(s) from Grandmother Anju when she’s 
reading me the stories?

A: Hahaha! This is so funny, because it fooled me as well but is so 
simple! On the first question she asks you, answer the real answer. On 
the Four Giants question, just answer “I don’t know” even though you do 
know. It fooled me twice! Make sure the All-Night Mask is equipped of 
course. But you should have already known that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why is your FAQ section so large?

A: Because people ask lot’s of questions about Zelda games? Oh, I just 
answered your question with a question... so off you go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I an only carry 99 rupees? What a jip!

A: Silly boy... just like in Ocarina of Time you an get Adult and Giant 
Wallets, which carry 200 and 500 Rupees respectively.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Collecting masks in this game sounds stupid and kiddy. And what’s 
with these stupid mini-games? 

A: WHY are you emailing me about this? Do I care? Don’t like it, then 
don’t play it. The logic that even a kindergartner could understand. 
Make sure that you also prove your masculinity by drinking some beer and 
shooting some squirrels... yea.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Am I going to lose my Hero’s Bow or Odolwa Mask when I travel back in 
time to the first day?

A: No, you only lose common replenishing items like arrows and bombs. 
One bad thing is you also lose any Powder Kegs you have, and they cost a 
whooping 100 rupees each. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: After I beat Goht, the Goron area was springtime and snow free. Then 
when I went back to the first day, the snow was back. What can I do 
about it?

A: In Majora’s Mask, you can beat ANY boss again. Just return to the 
temple where they are to fight them. And NO, you do not have to beat the 
temple again. If you have there remains, you can warp straight to the 
boss chamber. Very handy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: The final boss in the game is impossible!!! How do I beat him?

A: Well, you could read the section of this guide on that... But, 
without giving too much away, you can use the Fierce Deity’s Mask to 
make things extremely easy. You can check the masks section on how to 
acquire that. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Where is the Fierce Deity’s Mask?

A: I already answered that! Check the masks section!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Are the Gossip Stones from Ocarina of Time back in Majora’s Mask?

A: Yes, and I’m glad too. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I can’t find the Mask of Scents anywhere, where is it?

A: Besides checking the mask section?! The Mask of Scents can be found 
from the butler in Deku Palace AFTER you defeat Odolwa and have cleared 
the swamp of the poisonous water. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: In Ikana Canyon and Stone Tower Temple, how do I get rid of those 
blue blocks with the sun emblem on them?

A: Use your Mirror Shield to reflect sunlight on them. If no stream of 
sunlight are present, shoot a light arrow at the block to get rid of it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: In Ikana Canyon, in that girl’s music box house, what do I do with 
that guy who is a Gibdo down in that closet? 

A: Whatever you do, DON’T attack him. Because the girl will get in the 
way and block you. Instead, play the Song of Healing to transform him 
back to human form. Not only that, you get the Gibdo Mask. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I defeat Twinmold when the boss is so large?

A: Use the Giant’s Mask you got from Eyedol in the Stone Tower Temple.

faster then you can say “Help Me!” >=) 


Turn around and run forward up to the green vine curtain. Slash
it with your sword and it will collapse. Run into the holding cell room. 
        You finally get to meet the supposed “monkey-napped” Deku
Princess. She is pleased to meet you and asks if her monkey friend was
the one who told you to rescue her. Link replies yes and the Princess
says she could tell since your body smells a little like a monkey! She
is quite worried that when she didn’t return her father, the Deku King
would blame the monkey. Even go as far as to punish him. You tell her
the situation is worsening and that the king is actually doing that. The
Deku Princess states there is no there is no time to lose and to find
something to carry her in. Now, get out an empty bottle and set it to a
C button. If you still have a pink fairy in there, congratulate you self
and release it. Walk up to the Princess. Swing your bottle out and store
her in it. This is a very tight fit and you had best hurry back to Deku
Palace. Run forward out of the holding cell. Continue on and exit out of
Woodfall Temple. 
        Your back into Woodfall. The water is now clean to swim in and
will cause no harm to you. But your concern now is to get the princess
back to the Deku King. Run down this brick ramp and hop to the land
area. Run forward and exit out of the Woodfall area.
        This is the ledge next to the waterfall. Since the water is now
safe, just run forward and fall down to the water below. Swim forward
past the Lilly-pads and to the shore next to the dock. Climb onto the
dry land and run forward to enter into the grounds of Deku Palace. 
        Back in a small grass area. Put on your Deku Mask and run
forward over the grass area. Trot over the first tri-log raft. Hop to
the second and run forward, then to the third. Run up to the guards and
have the same conversation again. Run into the first palace corridor.
Travel down to the end and enter into the “Deku King’s Chamber.”
        Go forward and to the right of the bon fire pit. Run best the
King’s royal subjects and hop onto the stage. Trot right in front of the
Deku King’s throne, releasing her right here. The King will be relieved
that she is now back safely. The Deku Princess is not in the same good
spirits and she gets furious and jumps at the King, knocking him and
back. The Princess jumps up an down on his stomach causing the King’s
subjects to cower in fear. The Princess glares back at the subjects,
“Let that monkey go this instant!” The screen fades out.
        It fades back in with the Deku Princess, Link and the just
released Monkey all chatting in a circle, the Deku Princess apologizes
about how the King treated the poor monkey. The Monkey accepts it and
asks if everything is now returned to normal at Woodfall Temple. The
Princess says yes and both her and the monkey thank you for a job well
done. The butler has prepared a special gift for you in the Deku Shrine
for your exemplary work. This is the optional item, Mask of Scents. To
get it, look in “The Masks” section of this document. Otherwise, just
exit on out of the royal chamber. 
        When outside, get out your Ocarina of Time. Then on your Ocarina
play the Song of Time and save your game and warp back to the dawn of
the first day.
