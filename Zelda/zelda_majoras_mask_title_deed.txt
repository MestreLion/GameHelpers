09 Nov 2000:  After beating Majora's Mask and getting all the hearts, I 
              decided to write an FAQ guide for it, because in some
              areas, it is quite difficult.

--- WHY QUEST? ---
 ----------------

In order to complete the game fully, you'll need to get every piece of
heart.  It's a small accomplishment in your gaming career when you get
all 52 heart pieces, and doing this will get you a lot of them ;)


--- WHAT YOU WILL NEED ---
 ------------------------
To do this quest, you need to have beaten many other obstacles in the game.
You will need to have Epona, have quick access (Song of Soaring) to the
following areas: Clock Town, Ikana Canyon, Zora Cape, Milk Road. 

You'll need a little bit of time around, at least a half-hour. 

--- THE QUEST BEGINS! ---
 -----------------------

Dawn of the First Day:

1. Moon's Tear
  -  Run to EAST CLOCK TOWN, Pass the Bomber Kid, enter the ASTRAL
     OBSERVATORY.  Gaze through the TELESCOPE. Look at the top of 
     the CLOCK TOWER.  The MOON'S TEAR will fall.  Exit the nearby
     door and pick it up. 

2. Land Title Deed
  -  Go back to SOUTH CLOCK TOWN and find the GOLD DEKU LAUNCHER.  The
     Deku Business Scrub will ask for the MOON'S TEAR. Give it to him, 
     and he'll give you the LAND TITLE DEED, then fly away.  Use the 
     GOLD DEKU LAUNCHER to propel yourself onto the CLOCK TOWER, where
     a piece of heart is!

3. Swamp Title Deed
  -  Go to the SOUTHERN SWAMP and find the Deku Business Scrub near the
     PHOTO HUT.  Talk to him as LINK, and give him the LAND TITLE DEED. 
     He'll give you the SWAMP TITLE DEED and fly away.  As DEKU LINK, 
     use the LAUNCHER to propel yourself onto the PHOTO HUT ROOF, where
     another piece of heart is!

4. Mountain Title Deed
  -  Go to the GORON SHRINE AREA and find the Deku Business Scrub near the
     ENTRANCE TO THE GORON SHRINE.  Talk to him as DEKU LINK, and give him
     the SWAMP TITLE DEED.  He'll give you the MOUNTAIN TITLE DEED and fly
     away.  As DEKU LINK, use the LAUNCHER to propel yourself onto the
     nearby ledge, where another piece of heart is!

5. Ocean Title Deed
  -  Go to the ZORA HALL and find the Deku Business Scrub in LULU'S ROOM.
     Talk to him as GORON LINK, and give him the MOUNTAIN TITLE DEED. 
     He'll give you the OCEAN TITLE DEED and fly away.  As DEKU LINK, 
     use the LAUNCHER to propel yourself onto the nearby ledge, where
     another piece of heart is!

6. Wrapping It Up!
  -  Go to IKANA CANYON and find the Deku Business Scrub near the
     RIGHT SIDE OF THE MAP.  Talk to him as ZORA LINK, and give him the
     OCEAN TITLE DEED.  He'll give you a HUGE RUPEE (Worth 200 Rupees!)
     and fly away.  As DEKU LINK, use the LAUNCHER to propel yourself onto
     the ledge across the valley, where another piece of heart is!

     CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE SOLVED ONE OF THE MORE DETAILED QUESTS
     IN ZELDA 64: MAJORA'S MASK AND ASSEMBLED ANOTHER HEART PIECE!!
