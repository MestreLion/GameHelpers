FRENCH TRANSLATION: 
 
   I'd like to give major thanks to Mathieu MÈnard for translating this guide 
into French for me.  French readers can now find the translated version of this 
guide at: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/n64/file/zelda_majors_mask_french.txt 
Once again, major credit goes to Mathieu MÈnard for his excellent translating 
skills. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
V1.6 (01/06/2001): 
 
   Added three more monster descriptions to the Enemy Listing thanks to NPA 
Keaton, also changed the Legal Disclaimers to reflect the new year and added 
NPA Keaton to the credits section for his contribution. Thanks! 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.5 (12/28/2000): 
 
   Slightly reformatted the guide.  All section titles are now centered and 
I spellchecked the guide again as well. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
PLAGIARIST CAUGHT!: 
 
   The person who registered Pyro X's domain name received my letter and shut 
down Pyro X's site, so the plagiarist has been caught. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.4 (12/17/2000): 
 
   Added two more questions regarding the Great Fairy Sword to the "Frequently 
Asked Questions" section and fixed two mistranslations, both of these additions 
thanks to AstroBlue.  Don't forget to read the news above this. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.3 (12/16/2000): 
 
   Fixed a couple more translation errors that people have been correcting me 
on for some time now.  There still may be a few random song names that I've 
mistranslated, so if you find any mistakes, let me know. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.2 (11/26/2000): 
 
   A few more errors fixed thanks to several readers correcting them for me. 
Also did some formatting changes and spellchecked a bit. Not much more to come, 
just error fixing, question adding, spellcheckings and format changes here 
and there. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.1 (11/15/2000): 
 
   Fixed some more minor errors in the guide, as well as added a couple more 
secrets to the "Secrets" section (both thanks to Aprosenf@aol.com.) Added one 
more enemy to the enemy listing, and spellchecked the entire guide again. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
ANNOUNCEMENT: 
 
   It's seems the "Videogaming" web site (http://www.videogaming.net) has 
taken my guide without permission, but not only that...they've altered the 
legal disclaimer, the credits, and other sections of the guide, which is 
(believe it or not) breaking the copyright infringement law. If you are as sick 
and tired of these thieving sites as I am, give these guys a piece of your 
mind, their e-mail address is: info@videogaming.net. They've stolen literally 
thousands of other author's FAQs (including Dingo Jellybean's excellent Chrono 
Cross FAQ) and altered them. Thanks for any support you readers give me and the 
many other honest, hard-working authors out there. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V1.0 (11/14/2000): 
 
   After several e-mails, I've added the answer to the 22nd Keaton Question. 
Thanks to all who gave me the answer, although I can't credit you individually, 
I do thank you all. On a side note, please note that I receive tons of e-mail 
on a daily basis, and I can't reply to every single one. Don't take it 
personally, I just don't have time to reply to all of your e-mails. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.9 (11/09/2000): 
 
   This FAQ is now 100% complete! Everything is done; the walkthrough, the 
lists, the locations, everything. Of course, I'll still be updating with small 
things, like questions to add to the 'Frequently Asked Questions' section, or 
other small tidbits that I missed. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I did! 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.84 (11/02/2000): 
 
   Fixed some names to match the US version of the game, also finished off the  
"Anju and Kafei" notebook activity in the Side Quests section (thanks to 
SirCheeveri.) Added a few more mask locations, and that's about it for this 
update. Still have a few things left to add, but not much. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.8 (11/01/2000): 
 
   Added the remaining heart piece locations thanks to SirCheeveri, also fixed 
a few more errors in the FAQ, and added the rest of the 1st Skulltulla House 
locations thanks to Mr. ReX. Please people, I appreciate you trying to help, 
but it is unnecessary to constantly send me e-mail fixing very minor events in 
my FAQ. The way things are will work fine, and unless the error you find 
affects the game majorly, please don't e-mail me about it. I get way too much 
e-mail as it is, and I really don't need more. Also, any site can now use this 
FAQ as long as they ask first; I removed the list of sites that can use my FAQ 
because there are just too many to keep track of. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.79 (10/30/2000): 
 
   More Enemies added to the "Enemy Listing" section, changed some more names 
to match the US version, fixed a couple more minor errors and added more heart 
piece locations to the respective section, plus added some more characters to 
the characters section. The rest of the final boss strategy will be coming 
soon, to finish off that section. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.784 (10/29/2000): 
 
   Added the Stone Tower Temple Fairy Locations thanks to SirCheeveri, as well 
as fixed some more minor errors thanks to Thortok2000. Reformatted the Heart 
Piece Locations section so they are listed by location rather than just having 
them randomly numbered. More heart piece locations and enemies coming soon. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.78 (10/28/2000): 
 
   Pretty big update here. I fixed a bunch of small little errors and changed 
some more of the names to match the US version. Started the Notebook Entries 
part of the Side Quests section. I did a lot of work on the side quests section 
today. Started the "Secrets/Tips/Codes" section, as well as added more enemies 
to the enemy listing and spell checked the guide again. More to come. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.77 (10/27/2000): 
 
   Added a few more monsters to the Enemy List section, plus a few more items 
and weapons. I also changed a few more names to match the US version of the 
game, plus a few more questions to the F.A.Q. section and finally some additions 
to the "Side Quests/Misc." section; And that's about it for this version. More 
enemies, and random items, heart pieces, etc. coming soon. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.762 (10/26/2000): 
 
   Started the Enemy List section, as well as added a map of Termina in the 
"Game Overview" section. With the next update, I'll start the "Secrets" section 
and add a bunch more enemies as well as start updating the other incomplete 
sections of the guide. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.76 (10/25/2000): 
 
   Revised the Prologue to match the US version (thanks to Devin Morgan) and 
completely finished the Spoiler-Free Walkthrough.  I also have some new 
sections coming to the "Side Quests" section pretty soon, as well as all the 
other remaining sections I have to finish (or start in some cases.) 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.75 (10/25/2000): 
 
   Finished some more of the Spoiler-Free walkthrough, as well as changed a few 
more of the names so they match the US version. I still have a lot of changes 
to make as far as the names of locations, items, weapons, masks, songs, etc. 
go, so if you find a misspelled name, let me know so I can fix it. I'll try 
to finish up the spoiler-free walkthrough by tomorrow and start on the Enemy 
listing as well as the rest of the heart piece locations. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.74 (10/24/2000): 
 
   Alright, walkthrough is complete, with the exception of the rest of the 
final boss strategy, which I will be added shortly. I've added Dungeon Fairy 
Locations for the first three dungeons, thanks to The 64 Chimp, and the final 
dungeon fairy locations are coming soon. I also changed some of the names of 
locations, masks, and songs to the US names, but there are still some items, 
weapons, masks, songs, locations, enemies, bosses, etc. that still have the 
Japanese names, and I need you people to correct them for me, as I don't have 
nor do I have intentions of buying the US version. I also took my Spoiler-Free 
guide and added it to this FAQ, so if you still see my Spoiler-Free FAQ on 
GameFAQs, it isn't my fault, as I've requested it to be removed. More to come 
with the next update. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.71 (10/18/2000): 
 
   Walkthrough is now 98% complete, all I have to add are the strategies for 
the last two forms of the final boss, and that's it. In this update, I've 
added more to the "Filling the Log Book" side quest, as well as added more to 
the walkthrough. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.7 (10/17/2000): 
 
   Started and Finished both parts of the Stone Tower Temple (Reality and 
Illusion) in the walkthrough. The walkthrough is now 90% complete, and the only 
thing that needs to be done is the final stage of the game, as well as the 
final boss strategy. The dungeon fairy locations will be coming very soon, 
and once the walkthrough is finished I will begin adding the rest of the heart 
piece locations, and the remaining sections of the guide. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.681 (10/16/2000): 
 
   Fixed a few minor errors and added an easier way to defeating Gyorg (the 
third dungeon boss) thanks to The 64 Chimp. More on the walkthrough coming 
later today. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.68 (10/15/2000): 
 
   Finished up to the Stone Tower Temple. Walkthrough is now about 88% 
complete, but I still have to add the rest of the heart pieces, the remaining 
songs/masks/items and start/finish the enemy listing, along with add more 
questions to the F.A.Q. section, as well as start the secrets/codes/tips 
section + dungeon fairy locations and finish the 1st gold skulltulla house 
strategy. It sounds like a lot, but once I get the walkthrough done, the other 
stuff is a breeze to finish. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.65 (10/14/2000): 
 
   Started the "Filling the Log Book" side quest, not much finished on that 
yet, but I'm getting there. Added both Gold Skulltulla House side quests into 
the walkthrough, plus added up to the Underworld section in the walkthrough. 
A couple more masks have been added to the proper section, as well as another 
item to the "Items/Weapons" section, and that's pretty much it for this update. 
As usual, more to come. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.62 (10/13/2000): 
 
   Finished the Item Collection section after the Great Bay walkthrough, as 
well as the "Inside the Grave" section. Fixed some errors with a few of the 
heart pieces (removed the numbers of each heart piece all throughout the 
walkthrough) also added another mask and another song to the respective 
sections. This FAQ may now also be hosted by HYRULE: The Land of Zelda 
(http://www.htloz.com), more to come. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.6 (10/12/2000): 
 
   Started and finished the Great Bay Temple section in the walkthrough, 
including the boss strategy. Added a question to the F.A.Q. section, along 
with some more items/weapons, as well as the Gyorg Guardian Mask to the 
"Masks" section. I also remembered about the 15 dungeon fairies, and decided 
to list the locations of all 15 in each dungeon _after_ I finish the entire 
walkthrough itself. Also added another site to the list of sites who can post 
this FAQ, possibly more coming tonight, but most likely more coming tomorrow, 
if I feel better, that is. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.58 (10/11/2000): 
 
   All done with the (excessively long) Gerudo Lagoon section in the 
walkthrough, ready to start on the Great Bay Temple section. Added another 
song to the "Songs" section, along with a couple more weapons to the Item & 
Weapons section. Finally, I added another site to the list of sites who have 
permission to post this FAQ. More to come, as usual. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.5 (10/10/2000): 
 
   Got farther with the Gerudo Lagoon section in the walkthrough, added a bunch 
of items to the Item/Weapons list, along with 2 more heart piece locations 
in the "Heart Piece Locations" section. Also started the "Side Quests" section 
telling how to upgrade your Kokiri Sword to a Gilded Sword. Finally, added the 
controls for Zora Link, and spell-checked the document for the 2nd time. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.4 (10/10/2000): 
 
   Finished up the Great Bay/Zora Hall section in the walkthrough and began 
the Gerudo Lagoon section (finished up to the maze.) Also added a few items 
to the Items/Weapons section, as well as two more mask locations and 
descriptions to the Mask section (Zora Mask and Stone Mask.) More coming 
later today, or early tomorrow. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.3 (10/9/2000): 
 
   Not a big update, but I did add more to the walkthrough. Started the Great 
Bay/Zora Hall section in the walkthrough, almost finished with that. More 
item/weapons along with characters and more on the walkthrough coming with the 
next update. Now, I would like to ask all you readers a big favor. If you come 
across this FAQ posted on any web site other than the ones listed on the bottom 
of this FAQ, can you _please_ notify me so I can take care of it. I really hate 
sites who rip off other people's work, and only you can help me find them. 
Thank you. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.2 (10/8/2000): 
 
   Added mask functions for all the masks I had listed under the "Mask 
Locations" section, plus started the Items/Weapons section. It doesn't have 
much, but it has a few items (listed alphabetically.) Ran a spell-check over 
the guide and fixed a ton of typos. Also finished up the Romani Ranch area in 
the Walkthrough. Make sure you check out my Spoiler-Free guide for the game 
along with my Boss Guide while your at it. That's pretty much it for this 
version. More items/weapons along with more of the Walkthrough with the next 
update. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
V0.1 (10/06/2000): 
 
   Initial Release, started a lot of the main sections of the FAQ. Walkthrough 
is about 50% complete, characters section complete, overview complete (with the 
exception of the Termina Map), prologue complete, started the Heart Piece 
Locations section, as well as listed a bunch of songs and masks. If you see a 
section missing, that means it hasn't been added yet, but will within given 
time. Initially, I planned to release this FAQ when it was 100% complete, but 
I have SEVERAL reasons as to why I decided against that. This FAQ, however, 
will be updated daily, with large sized updates until it is finished, which 
shouldn't be too far off in the distance. 
 
 
=============================================================================== 
                                 II.  PROLOGUE 
=============================================================================== 
 
                 In the land of Hyrule, there echoes a legend. 
        A legend held dearly by the Royal Family that tells of a boy...       
 
               A boy who, after battling evil and saving Hyrule,                
            crept away from that land that had made him a legend...             
 
                Done with the battles he once waged across time, 
           he embarked on a journey. A secret and personal journey... 
 
           A journey in search of a beloved and invaluable friend... 
                       A friend with whom he parted ways 
                 When he finally fulfilled his heroic destiny 
                      and took his place among legends... 
 
 
=============================================================================== 
                               III.  CHARACTERS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   You will notice some familiar and not-so-familiar faces in this game. Some 
returning favorites from Zelda: OoT, some not-so-favorites, and a bunch of new 
faces. You will also find some bosses from previous Zelda games here. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              Anju the Innkeeper 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Anju is a woman who was once engaged to be wed to a man named Kafei. Anju 
has the Moon Mask in her possession, and when combined with the Sun Mask, the 
two create the "Mask of the Wedded Couple" so Kafei decided to steal the Sun  
Mask from the Happy Mask Man, but the Happy Mask Man put a curse on Kafei when 
he found out, and the two were never married. Anju went back to her normal job 
of running the Inn on the right side of Clock Town, and her worst feature 
would be cooking. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              Anju's Grandmother 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Anju's Grandmother lives her life at the Inn, where her granddaughter works, 
but she can't be talked to unless you are wearing the All Night Mask (see the 
Masks section on how to get this mask.) If you talk to her while wearing this 
mask and listen to her stories, she will reward you with a heart piece. You 
can find her in one of the rooms of the Inn on the right side of Clock Town. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             The Five Bomber Kids 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This group of kids have formed a group named the "Bombers." There are a 
total of 5 of these guys, and they hang out in Clock Town. You can play 
Hide-n-Seek with them, and as a reward for finding them (as Deku Link) you will 
gain the password that gives you access to the observatory. You will only find 
these guys in Clock Town. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            Cremia the Ranch Owner 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This is Romani's older sister and she helps out around the ranch with the 
animals. If you talk to her in the morning of the 2nd Day, you can help her on 
the 2nd day at 6:00 PM while she delivers the milk by fending off the Gormans 
who try to steal your milk bottles. Use arrows to push them back and make sure 
they don't break any of the bottles of milk to be rewarded with a heart piece. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                The Deku Scrubs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Yes, the Deku Scrubs are back! They only do favors for their own kind, so 
if you expect to get anything from them, you'll have to use your Deku Mask. 
Skull Kid will transform Link into a Deku Scrub in the beginning of the game, 
so you can see what the life of a Deku is. Their princess is missing, and you 
must find her to rescue the monkey they are holding for the crime. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              The Gorman Brothers 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The Gorman brothers run their own little ranch near Milk Road, but they 
are rather rude people. If you talk to them, one of them will offer to sell you 
some milk, and later on in the game, they will challenge you to a race (after 
you get Epona back.) If you win, you will get a new mask that helps in your 
progress of the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  The Gorons 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The groaning Gorons are in Termina too, on Snowhead Mountain, only now 
their fiery home has become all frozen over. If you don't rescue them, they 
will eventually die, ending their race. The Goron mask will allow you to morph 
into a Goron, giving you abilities which will allow you to save the Goron race, 
as well as converse with them in ease. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              The Happy Mask Man 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Yes, a returning face. The Happy Mask Man hangs around the Clock Tower in 
Clock Town. He informs Link that all of his masks are gone, including the Mask 
of Majora, and he needs you to collect them all back. You will also learn the 
Song of Healing from him, which will cure any curse (using masks.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            Kamaro the Cursed Man 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This guy stands on a mushroom shaped platform near the outskirts of Clock 
Town, and he's cursed by a mask which constantly makes him do a weird dance. 
Jump over to him and play the Song of Healing to receive his mask, which you 
can then use to get a heart piece from the girls in clock town. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             Kafei, Anju's Fiancé 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Kafei was engaged to be married to Anju, but the day before their wedding, 
he stole the "Sun Mask" from the Happy Mask Man in order to combine it with 
Anju's "Moon Mask" to create the "Mask of the Wedding Couple," but there was 
just one minor setback: the Happy Mask Man found out about it. He placed a 
curse on Kafei, which turned him into a little boy. From that day on, Kafei 
hid his face in a Keaton Mask and lived away in Clock Town. Anju went back 
to working at the Inn in Clock Town after her future husband never showed up 
for the wedding. (Note that this may or may not be true, as it is never 
mentioned in the game.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                          Link, The Hero of the Game 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Obviously, the game is nothing without it's hero, Link. After defeating 
Ganon, rides through the forest but ends up getting lost in a place called 
Termina. He must find his way back to Hyrule, but is interrupted by an imp 
named Skull Kid who steals his horse and Ocarina, so he decides to help out a 
bit at Termina (and get his prized possessions back) before he goes back to his 
home town. Link now has a new ability, transforming into characters. With 
certain masks, Link can transform into a new character with new abilities. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                           The Postman of Clock Town 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The postman (who is dressed in a toga outfit) runs all around Clock Town on 
a daily basis, delivering and collecting mail. He is a fast runner, so if you 
plan to keep up with him, you'll need the Bunny Hood. If you follow him around 
for the whole day, and visit his home, he will test your reflexes with a little 
game to see if you can stop the clock on 10 seconds exactly, if so you'll win 
a heart piece. Other than that, the postman really has no other significance 
in the game, except delivering mail. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               The Rosa Sisters 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   These two sisters are identical twins and are located on the left side of 
Clock Town. They dance to some weird music during the night (6:00 PM - 5:00 AM) 
on Days 1 and 2, and if you teach them a new dance using Kamaro's Mask, they 
will reward you with a heart piece. If you check the Inn on the right side of 
Clock Town, you will find them staying there during the day. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Romani, The sister of Cremia 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This girl lives at the Romani ranch, she is one of the 2 sisters who live 
in a house near the barn. Talk to her after you finish the 2nd dungeon and you 
can play some cool mini-games (kill off ghosts to protect her animals, etc.) to 
gain useful items. She looks like the girl in Ocarina of Time as well. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              Skull Kid, The Imp 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This evil thief is nothing but trouble. In the opening scene, you will find 
him robbing you of your Ocarina and your beloved horse, Epona. He hangs out 
with 2 little fairies, who are sort of like his evil minions. What makes him 
so evil? He's wearing the Mask of Majora, which has unbelievable powers. You 
will encounter him early in the game, right after he takes your valuables 
you must give chase. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            Tatl, Link's Companion 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This is 1 of Skull Kid's "minions" and strangely, Tatl looks very similar to 
Navi. After Skull Kid transforms Link into a Deku Scrub in the beginning of the 
game, Tael will follow him, so Tatl decides to join you and help you get back 
to Hyrule. So, I guess you could say that Tatl is evil, but a good kind of 
evil. Tatl will act the same way Navi did in Zelda: OoT, gives you important 
information about enemies, signs, items, etc. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                          Tael, Skull Kid's Companion 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The 2nd, black fairy of Skull Kid's, Tael really has no significance in the 
game. He just likes to hang around with Skull Kid and help him do his dirty 
deeds by stealing from people. It may seem that Skull Kid treats Tael with very 
little respect, but the 2 are inseparable. You won't receive much help from 
Tael, he's not as kind-hearted as his sister Tatl. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             Tingle the Map Maker 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Tingle is the map maker of the game with paint on his face that floats 
around different areas of the game with a red balloon. Shoot the balloon with 
an arrow (or anything else you have to shoot it with) to bring him down and you 
can buy various maps for him for (somewhat) reasonable prices. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             Twinrova, The Witches 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Remember those 2 witch sisters from Zelda: OoT (they were one of the bosses) 
well, they're back. Koume and Kotake (which make up Twinrova) are back, but 
don't worry, they aren't villains anymore. You'll have to save Kotake early on 
in the game by gaining some potion from her sister's potion shop in the swamp. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   The Zoras 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Wow, since the last time you saw these fishy people, they've now started 
up a musical band. They live in the Great Bay, but their nice cool habitat 
has become too warm for them to survive in, and to top it all off, their band 
isn't going so well. You're job is to save their band, as well as their lives.

                              IV.  GAME OVERVIEW 
===============================================================================

                                  TIME SYSTEM 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   You may have noticed there is now an on-screen clock with the Day number, 
and what current time it is. You will have a total of 3 days before the moon 
falls and you get game over. Every hour in the game = 60 seconds in real life. 
No, you don't have 3 days to finish the game but 3 days to finish up what you 
are currently doing. For instance, say you are in a dungeon and it's Day 3. 
You can play the "Song of Time" which will warp you back to Day #1, but you'll 
also lose all of your current item inventory (rupees, arrows, bombs, sticks, 
etc.) There are several songs which alter the game clock in all different 
ways. You can increase time, decrease time, etc. using different songs. 
 
   Keep an eye on your clock and make sure you aren't running low on time, and 
don't worry about losing your place in the game. There are now owl statues, 
which are located in almost every area of the game. Hit the statue to remember 
your place, and you can warp to that location with a tune of your Ocarina. 
This system may seem a bit complicated, but you will eventually get used to it 
after the first 20 minutes of gameplay. Also keep in mind that some tasks can 
only be accomplished at night, others during the day, and some must be done 
at a specific time. 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
                                  GAME SCREEN 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   The game screen is pretty similar to that of "Zelda: Ocarina of Time" with 
a few changes and additions. In the upper left corner of the screen is your 
health meter. You start out with 3 hearts, and gradually increase as you 
collect heart pieces (4 heart pieces = 1 heart increase on meter.) Right under 
that is your Magic Meter, which can be increased by collecting dungeon fairies 
and taking them back to the great fairy (see the next section.) When you do 
things such as shoot bubbles, power charge your sword, shoot fire arrows, or 
anything that requires magic, you will lose a bit off your magic meter. To 
replenish magic on your meter, collect a bottle of magic or a jug which 
replenishes more. 
 
   In the bottom-left corner is your wallet amount. This will display how many 
rupees you have currently collected, and when in dungeons, you can see how 
many Small Keys you've collected so far. You can increase the size of your 
wallet by depositing 200 rupees into your bank account in Clock Town. Right 
in the center of the screen (on the bottom) is your on-screen clock. You can 
see the hour and minute hand, as well as what day it is here, make sure you 
keep a watch on your clock, just to make sure you're not running low on time. 
Moving along, in the bottom right corner is your mini-map. Some areas have no 
maps, in which case there will be nothing here, but when you have a map of 
a dungeon or a town, it will appear in a mini version here. 
 
   Finally, in the top right corner of the screen is your action area. You 
have the A and B buttons, which light up when you are supposed to press them 
(for instance, when standing in front of a door, the A button will light up 
on the screen, saying the word "Open" meaning you press the A button to open 
the door) and you also have your 3 action buttons (C-Left, C-Down, C-Right.) 
You are allowed to set 3 items to your action buttons (1 on each button) and 
then when that button is pressed, the item that is set to it will be in use. 
For example, say you have the Ocarina set to the C-Right button, whenever you 
press C-Right, Link will take out his Ocarina. The game screen is pretty much 
the same as Ocarina of Time, with the addition of the on-screen clock. 
 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
                                DUNGEON FAIRIES 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   A nice little puzzle has been added to the game (sort of replacing the Gold 
Skulltulla quest in Ocarina of Time.) In each dungeon (Woodfall Temple, 
Snowhead Temple, etc.) you have an optional little game to play. Hidden in 
each dungeon are 15 fairies, they can be in treasure chests, floating in 
bubbles, inside enemies, behind blocks, in pots, and almost everywhere else. 
Your goal is to collect all 15 of them, and take them to the nearby fairy 
fountain (there is a fairy fountain near every dungeon) and you will be 
rewarded for finding them all. If you're having trouble finding all of the 
fairies, my Walkthrough below has all of their locations in all of the 
dungeons you'll encounter in the game. 
 
   Remember, this is totally optional, but it is rather useful because you 
can maximize your Magic Meter, or receive other helpful rewards. You will also 
notice that some fairies are blue, while others are yellow. There _is_ a 
difference between the colors of the two; whichever color the fairies are, 
that's the great fairy fountain you'll return them to. This new feature kind 
of replaces the Gold Skulltulla collection (which was found in Ocarina of Time) 
but it's totally up to you whether you want to collect the fairies or not, it 
is not mandatory, but if you do collect them, it's beneficial to your game. 
 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
                              THE OCARINA & SONGS 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   A brief history of the Ocarina: In Zelda V (Ocarina of Time) Link first 
received his Ocarina from a lovely girl named Saria. For those wondering what 
an Ocarina actually is, it's a musical instrument with finger holes and a 
mouthpiece for playing different tunes. Throughout the game, you will learn 
many, many songs on your Ocarina, each having its own purpose. Some songs alter 
time, others help you proceed with the game, some are hidden (meaning you will 
never learn them, but can still play them, hence why they are called "hidden" 
songs) and the rest you learn from different people. The whole reasoning behind 
the songs is to add some uniqueness to the game, after all, the Zelda series 
is known for being unique. 
 
   There is now a new feature with the Ocarina ("new feature" meaning that I'm 
comparing it to Ocarina of Time) which is different instruments. That's right, 
you can now play songs on other instruments other than the plain old Ocarina. 
When you are Deku Link, you can play with Deku Pipes, and as Goron Link, you can 
play with a bongo drum set. This is a nice change from Ocarina of Time, as it 
adds a variety of sounds to listen to. As you learn new songs, they are 
recorded in your game status menu, so you'll never lose them once you learn 
them. If you forget how to play a song, use the game menu as a reference on 
the correct buttons to press.

  then kill at least 4 statues to get a small key. 
 
* Go back out of the hole and through the locked door, then swim underwater as 
  Zora Link until you reach a hand that will throw you onto a platform with a 
  chest containing a small key in it. 
 
* Go past the hand this time and into the next room. Climb onto the middle  
  platform and shine light onto the mirror, then shine from the mirror to the 
  sun block to remove it. 
 
* Open the chest for the compass, then go back to the strip of land and through 
  the once locked door at the end. 
 
* As Goron Link, punch out the parts of the pillar in this room, then kill the 
  Black Boes, and start shining light on the left mirror (for at least 15 
  seconds.) Run to that mirror and shine it onto the next, and then shine from 
  that mirror onto the sun block. 
 
* Use the Deku Launchers and the air pipes to fly around the building over to 
  the left side, where you will find a platform; land on it. 
 
* Go through the door and fight/kill the Ghost of Garo (see below section for 
  strategy.) 
 
* After it's dead, go through the door and lure the eyegole towards you, then 
  quickly back off and shoot it's yellow eye with an arrow (repeat until he's 
  dead.) 
 
* Go through the door, save your game, then warp to the owl statue in Stone 
  Tower to enter the dungeon again, only this time it's an illusion. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Stone Tower Temple (Illusion) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
* Make the three blocks appear again by cloning yourself on the 3 switches 
  (Left, Right, Center) but stop on the 3rd block. 
 
* Shoot an arrow at the red switch in front of you (on the wall below) then 
  enter the dungeon again. 
 
* Go through the door on the right this time, and shoot a light arrow at the 
  sun block to move it out of your way. 
 
* Use the Deku Launchers and air pipes to launch up to a platform with an 
  enemy on it. Kill the enemy and go through the opening, step on the switch 
  and come back. 
 
* Open the newly appeared chest for a small key. Launch up to the tip top of 
  the ceiling and float over to the ledge with a locked door on it. 
 
* With your key, open the door and shoot an arrow at the red switch across the 
  room, then go through the lava pit as goron link. 
 
* Shoot the switch again and go through the door to find another red switch; 
  fire an arrow at it, then jump down and push the block so it's centered 
  with the room. 
 
* Shoot the red switch for the 2nd time and push the block to the other side 
  of the room. Shoot the switch again, and push the block up against the raised 
  floor, and shoot the switch one last time, then push the block into the hole 
  to open the barred door. 
 
* Go through the door and fight/defeat wizrobe again. Use your hookshot on the 
  chest that appears on top and go through the door. 
 
* Launch across the room and go through the door, then use the hookshot on the 
  hanging spikes over to the left to make them explode. 
 
* Launch over to where the spikes were and use the launcher there to get across 
  to the other end of the room, where you can go through the next door. 
 
* Fight and defeat Gomez (see strategy in next section) and collect the Boss 
  Key after he's dead. 
 
* Go back to the room before the hanging spikes and launch to the alcove to 
  the left. 
 
* Find the switch in this area and step on it and get the small key from the 
  treasure chest that appears. 
 
* Head back to the previous room and go through the door into the hanging spike 
  room once again. Turn right and go through the door here. 
 
* Kill the Eyegole here, then open the chest to get the Giant Mask, which you 
  will be using for the boss battle for this dungeon. 
 
* Go through the door here, watching out the for spiked rod, and hit the switch 
  then hookshot up to the chest. 
 
* Hookshot to the plate and collect items, then go through the door to fight 
  and defeat Twin-Mold using the Giant Mask (see strategy in below section.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   The Moon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
* Make sure you have all the 20 normal masks for this next part, then when you 
  are ready, warp to day 3 and wait until 12:00 AM. 
 
* Go to fight Skull Kid again, but this time, play the Oath to Order and view 
  the cinema. 
 
* Talk to each of the four kids around the tree and give them the respective 
  amount of masks to get in and out of each dungeon. 
 
* See the below section for strategies on all 4 of the "mini-dungeons" you 
  will go through. You will get the Fierce Deity Mask after you go through each 
  dungeon. 
 
* Talk to the kid sitting down near the tree to fight the final boss. See the 
  below section for boss the boss strategy. 
 
 
=============================================================================== 
                               VI.  WALKTHROUGH 
=============================================================================== 
 
   The following walkthrough is completely accurate for all regional versions 
of the game (NA, JP, EU) and was composed from my experience of playing through 
the game. Although the following pertains to all regional versions of the game, 
it _was_ based on playing the JP version, therefore some names/locations, etc. 
in the walkthrough may be inaccurate (I'm not very good at translating.) If you 
find an error of a location name, character name, song name, mask, name, item 
name, etc. and would like to correct it, please do so by e-mailing me (e-mail 
address is in the "Information" section.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 The Beginning 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Link, is riding Epona through the forest, calmly, quietly, when suddenly, 2 
fairies appear. One appears to look like Navi (but it isn't) and the other is 
a darker colored fairy. These 2 are Chat and Trail (JP) also known as Tatl and 
Tael (US). These 2 fairies stick around with an evil creature named Skull Kid. 
Tatl and Tael will frighten Epona, who kicks Link off and onto the ground, 
where he becomes unconscious. Moments later, Skull Kid appears (wearing the 
mask of Majora.) He giggles a few times, then walks up to Link, kicks him over 
and searches his pockets (yes, he's a thief.) He finds the Ocarina, takes it, 
and begins to play notes. 
 
   Link awakens at the sound of the Ocarina, and looks at Skull Kid. Startled, 
Skull Kid hides the Ocarina behind his back, but it's too late. Link approaches 
him, but just as he gets there, Skull Kid hops onto Epona. The thrill music 
begins to play, and as Skull Kid starts to ride away with your Ocarina and your 
horse, Link grabs on to Epona, and is taken alongside his horse. He can't hold 
on for long, and eventually falls off to watch Skull Kid get away with his 2 
most prized values. Link then picks himself up, and you are left to go after 
Skull Kid to reclaim your valuables. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Lost Woods 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Deku Nuts 
 
   Alright, head north, where there are 2 patches of bushes on both sides of 
the path. Cut them up to gain at least 5 rupees (you will need them for the 
upcoming town) then continue north through the cave opening. Jump across the 
platforms, and through the opening at the end. A cinema will show link falling 
from the cliff all the way down to a little area. Floating in mid-air will be 
Skull Kid. He puts a spell on Link that turns him into a Deku Scrub, then 
laughs a bit, and floats back through a door. When you are left to play again, 
go through this door, and into the next room. Here, you will find some Deku 
Launchers (flowers on the ground) which will Launch you into mid-air where you 
can glide. Use the flowers to cross all the platforms, then land on the ledge, 
and go through the door into the next room. 
 
   This place has the same Deku Launchers, but much taller platforms. Float 
over to the 2nd platform, and open the treasure chest to gain 10 DEKU NUTS. 
Continue gliding across, from platform to platform (dodging the walls in 
between) until you reach the end, where a Deku plant will be standing. Ignore 
him for now, and go through the door into the twisted hallway. A cinema with 
motion blur engages, and you are taken to the next room (which happens to be 
the inside of the Clock Tower.) When here, follow the ramps leading upward, 
where the Happy Mask Man is waiting. He will converse with Link, then let him 
be on his way. Go through the big double doors to be brought into Clock Town, 
the first town of the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Clock Town 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Town Map, Fairy, Moon's Tear, Land Title Deed 
Heart Pieces: 2 
 
   In order to make your way around town with ease, you'll need to get a map. 
From the starting point, turn around and go up the ramps to the right, and head 
through the opening at the top. This leads you into a new area with a kid 
shooting at a balloon. Near the exit of this area, you will find a tiger faced 
elf named Tingle who draws maps for a living. Buy the Clock TOWN MAP from him 
for 5 Rupees (buy the Woodfall one for 40 if you have enough) and go back to 
the main area of Clock Town (where you first started.) Using your brand new 
map, follow it all the way to the southwest of Clock Town, where there is a 
lake, and a bridge. Hovering over the lake is a FAIRY, hop over to it (in as 
few jumps as possible) to collect it. Now go back to the place where you got 
the map. 
 
   In this area is a little fence with an opening next to it. Walk through the 
opening and into the Fairy Fountain. Drop off the fairy you got earlier, where 
she will join up with all the other fairies and turn into one Great Fairy. The 
Great Fairy (who still has that laugh from Zelda: OoT) will give Deku Link a 
new Magic Meter as well as a new ability, Bubble Shooting! Hold down the B 
button to blow a bubble, and release it at the desired size to shoot it at a 
specified object or person. However, if you hold B too long, the bubble will 
pop before you even get to fire it. Leave the Fairy Fountain, and test out your 
new ability by firing a bubble at the blue balloon in the sky. Once you pop it, 
the little kid (who has been trying to pop it) will become upset. 
 
   Talk to him, and he will offer you a little game of Hide and Seek. He and 
4 of his buddies will hide from you (all within Clock Town) and give you 
exactly 1 day (24 hours) to find all of them. This will be rather easy and 
rewarding at the end. The first 2 kids are in this very area, one behind the 
tree and one behind the slide (they will try and run from you, so give chase 
if they attempt escape.) Once you catch those 2, make your way to the right 
of town (use your map) where the next 2 are. One is on top the roof holding 
a chicken, and when you approach him, he flies down (follow him until you 
catch him.) The next one, you must use a Deku Launcher to capture. Fly up to 
the roof near the Deku Launcher to get him. 
 
   The final one is on the left side of town (use your map) and he's just out 
in the open, not very hard to catch. Once you catch him, you will be 
transported back to the area where you got the map, where the 5 kids will all 
turn around revealing numbers on the back of their shirts. This is a password, 
so remember it (you can always ask the kid on the roof if you forget.) Go to 
the northeast part of town, where a kid (similar to the ones you just caught) 
will be blocking you from going into a new area. Give him the password to make 
him move, then walk down the ramp and into the underground area. Hop the water, 
and kill the Skulltulla that drops down. When you come to the room with the 
balloon, pop it so you can climb the ladder. 
 
   Break the pots for some extra money, then go up the colored stairs to the 
top of the observatory, where an old wise man is looking through his telescope. 
Talk to him and he will offer you a look, use A to zoom and B to cancel. Aim 
the telescope towards the top of the Clock Tower, and zoom in to see Skull Kid. 
A cinema will play, showing the moon shedding a teardrop that lands right 
outside, followed by Skull Kid giving Link an obscene gesture. Go through the 
door, which leads to the outside of the observatory. Walk over the MOON'S 
TEAR to pick it up and put it in your item stash. Go back through the  
observatory, and out of the underground area with the water, back into the main 
part of Clock Town. Near a set of stairs is some water with a Deku Launcher 
next to it, head here to see a Deku Scrub fly from above with 2 bags in his 
hand. 
 
   He will land on the Deku Launcher, and requests a Moon TearDrop from you. 
Set the Moon's TearDrop to one of the C-Buttons, and give it to him. In return, 
he will give you the LAND TITLE DEED (a.k.a. - a map) and fly away with 3 
bags, allowing you to use the Deku Launcher. Now all you can do is wait until 
12AM on the 3rd day to proceed, so in the meantime, you may as well collect 
some heart pieces. Go back to the area (all the way north) where you got the 
Town Map, and use the boxes/platforms near the slide to reach the tree, which 
has a HEART PIECE located in between its branches. Now, make your way back 
to the center of town, where the Deku Launcher is. 
 
   Use it to launch yourself up on the small roof in the middle of the Clock 
Tower, where you will find another HEART PIECE waiting for you to collect. 
Now, you must wait until 12AM on the 3rd night. If you wish, you can talk to 
the Scarecrow at the observatory to speed up time. Once 12AM strikes on the 
3rd day, fireworks will be set off on top of the Clock Tower. The tower will 
fall revealing steps that lead to the roof. You now have 5 hours (5 minutes 
real-time) before the final day is over. Launch yourself on top of the little 
roof on the Clock Tower (where you got the Heart Piece) and climb up the stairs 
to find Skull Kid floating around, time for a fight! 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Skull Kid the Imp 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Ocarina 
Songs: Song of Time 
 
   Skull Kid uses his powers on the moon above in order to help him with the 
battle. Anyway, he doesn't have any attacks, so you can't really get hurt. Just 
shoot him once with your Bubble Shooter and he'll drop your OCARINA. Pick it 
up, and Link will have a flashback of the time when Princess Zelda taught him 
the SONG OF TIME (Zelda: OoT) he then re-learns the song now. When played, this 
song will take you back 1 day in time (it will also save your game in the JP 
version of the game.) The battle continues with Skull Kid, but there is no way 
you can defeat him, so just play the Song of Time to end the battle. You will 
be left back in the main part of Clock Town on Day 1 again. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                       Item Collection #1 (Clock Town)* 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Fairy, Bomber's Notebook, Adult Wallet 
Songs: Song of Healing 
Heart Pieces: 2 
Masks: Deku Mask, Great Fairy Mask, Blast Mask, Bremen Mask 
       Mask of Kafei, Rabbit Hood, All Night Mask 
 
   Remember, not all of the items, masks, and heart pieces have to be 
collected now. I suggest you try and get them now, to help you with your quest 
later in the game, but if you can't get them, or don't feel like getting them, 
you can always come back later. Now that Skull Kid is out of the way, go 
through the double doors of the clock tower once again, and a rather odd 
conversation will engage with the Happy Mask Man. He will teach you the SONG 
OF HEALING on your Ocarina, which allows you to heal anybody that has a curse 
on them with a mask. When you play the song, Link's DEKU MASK will come off, 
and you will gain it for one of your masks. Finish the conversation with the 
Happy Mask Man, then leave the Clock Tower and go back to the south, where the 
river is. 
 
   Remember that FAIRY hovering over the water before? Well, there is now 
another one in the same spot. Hop in the water to get it, then take it back to 
the Great Fairy over in the Fairy Fountain where you got the Town Map earlier. 
Once you re-join all the fairies again, the Great Fairy will appear and give 
you the GREAT FAIRY MASK, which will attract roaming fairies in caves when 
worn. A lot of obstacles in Majora's Mask are time-based, meaning you can only 
do them at certain times on certain days. At 12AM on any day, go to the area 
where you got the Town Map, and you will see an old woman walking by with a 
bag in her hand. Moments later, a thief will come along, snatch the bag and 
try to escape, leaving you to catch him. 
 
   Hit him with your sword before he escapes through the exit, and he will drop 
the bag. When he finally leaves, you will be rewarded with the BLAST MASK 
(given by the old woman) for your heroism. Now, if you hurry, you can get 
another mask at the same time. Run down to the south where the river is 
located, and you will find a man playing his music box (he looks as if he is 
the man from Zelda: OoT.) Talk to him, and he will give you the BREMEN MASK, 
which looks like a bird's face. When worn, press the B button, hold it and move 
with the Control Stick to do the Chicken March. When it is daylight once again, 
go to the north part of town (where you got the map), and as normal Link talk 
to the bomber kid blocking the path to the observatory again. 
 
   Go into the observatory, then come back out and talk to the bomber kid 
here and you will receive a BOMBER'S NOTEBOOK (also known as the Log Book) with 
which you can record your events in (you will record faces and items in this 
book as you talk to people and collect new items/masks.) Don't go too far, 
because if it's between 10AM and 8PM, head through the door next to the kid who 
was blocking your path. Once inside, go into the door on the right, and talk to 
the woman sitting in the chair. Say Yes, and she will give you the MASK OF 
KAFEI to add to your collection 
 
   There is a man on the left side of Clock Town (refer to your map) who runs 
a bank. You can deposit and withdraw money with him. Go just outside of Clock 
Town, chopping up the plants to gain at least 200 rupees, then take them back 
and deposit them with the man to receive the ADULT WALLET. If you have the 
patience, go out and collect up to 5,000 rupees and the man will give you 
a HEART PIECE. Now, to get the last mask, you will have to come back here at 
a later time. You will need the Mask of Kafei, the Giant Wallet, and 500 rupees 
to get this next mask. Once you have the above, stop the burglar on the 1st 
night, then on the 3rd night at 10:00 PM go to the Curiosity Shop on the left 
side of town to purchase the ALL NIGHT MASK. 
 
   On the 3rd night, at 12AM, leave Clock Town through the south exit, and 
walk along the southwest path (fighting the enemies as you go.) You will soon 
come to Romani Ranch, where you will find Epona, you can't get her just yet, 
so go into the back of the Barn, where there will be a man sitting, upset. He 
will tell you that his chicks won't hatch into Chickens. Put on the Bremen Mask, 
hold the B button, and march around, collecting all the chicks so they follow 
you (there are 10 chicks total.) Once they have all been collected, they will 
mature, 1 by 1 into full grown chickens. The man will reward you for your 
kind deed with the BUNNY HOOD, which allows Link to run faster and jump farther 
when worn. 
 
   Head back into Clock Town, and put on your new Bunny Hood. Search around 
town to find the mailman (the guy who is running with a bag) and follow him 
around, until he eventually stops at his house, follow him inside. Talk to 
him while he is sitting on his bed (make sure you have 3 rupees) and he will 
offer to play a time game. He starts the clock, and if you stop it on exactly 
10 seconds, you will gain a HEART PIECE. When you are all done collecting 
the items (if you want to collect them) leave through the south exit of Clock 
Town. 
 
*Most items here are optional, but I suggest you collect them for future use 
 in the game, that way you won't have to come back later.

                                   The Swamp 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Bottle, Red Potion, Pictograph Box 
Heart Pieces: 2 
 
   Once out of Clock Town, take the straight path up to the tree where you will 
see a cinema of Skull Kid and his 2 fairies (if you didn't see it on the way to 
Romani Ranch, you'll see it now.) Go past the tree with the carving on it, 
into the next area, where there are several trees. First, kill the bats near 
the first tree, then climb up the tree to the top to find a HEART PIECE [5]. 
Continue following the same path into the next area with water and a building. 
Here, you will see a cinema of a witch flying out from the building, then you 
are left to play. Climb up the ladder and give the Land Owner's Paper to the 
Deku Scrub, then use the deku launcher to fly up to the roof of the photo hut 
to get another HEART PIECE. Find the lilly pads, and follow them until you 
come to dry land again. Go through and into this new area, and make your way 
to the back of the hut to find a cave entrance, go inside. 
 
   Here, you will find a monkey, put on your Bunny Hood, talk to him and follow 
him through the caves, where he will lead you to Kotake (one half of Twinrova 
from Zelda: OoT) who is lying on the ground, in need of some red potion. Exit 
the cave, and climb the ladder leading into the hut. Talk to Koume (the sister 
of Kotake, making up Twinrova from Zelda: OoT) and she will give you a BOTTLE 
of RED POTION to take back to Kotake. Go back into the cave, and follow the 
monkey to Kotake. Take off your Bunny Hood before talking to her, and set the 
Potion to one of the C-Buttons. Then talk to her and when she asks you to press 
the C-Button you have the potion on, do so to give it to her (if you drink it, 
you'll have to go and buy some more from Koume.) 
 
   She will fly away, leaving you to play again. Exit the cave, and you will 
be confronted by 3 monkeys. Talk to them, and follow them once again to the 
area you were previously in. Climb the ladder, and go into the Photo Hut. In 
the little hole in the wall, you will see Kotake, talk to her and you will 
receive the PICTOGRAPH BOX as well as a free boat ride. Take the boat, until it 
asks if you want to get off. Say yes, and put on your Deku Mask when you get 
off.

Heart Pieces: 2 
 
   Go straight through, and talk to the Deku Scrubs blocking your way and they 
will move. Continue going north and into the next room, where you will find 
the Deku King and his people. Talk to the king to find out the Princess has 
been kidnapped. Take out your Pictograph Box and get a good picture of the 
king, then talk to the monkey on the left side of the room (when facing the 
king.) Now leave, and the monkey will confront you outside. If you haven't 
bought any MAGIC BEANS yet, go through the maze (either door on the 
left/right) and drop through a hole in the ground to find a salesman who will 
sell them to you. You can also drop through one of the holes in the maze to 
find a HEART PIECE. Once you have the beans, go back to the outside area and 
use the lilly pads to cross over the poisonous water (the right side.) 
 
   At the end, you will find a dirt patch where you can plant the magic beans. 
On the 2nd day, it will rain, and the plant will grow into a transportation 
leaf (if you don't want to wait for the 2nd day, you can get some water from 
the Photo Hut.) Use the leaf to go on the top part of the maze you saw before. 
You will have to use the Deku Launchers to go through the maze. If you fall, 
go back and use the transportation leaf, because you must stay on the top part 
of the maze. Use the Deku Launchers to cross over both sections of the maze to 
get where the monkey was inside the throne room. On the way, to kill the Deku 
Scrubs, use your Bubble Shooter from a distance, one shot should kill them. 
Talk to the monkey, then take out your ocarina. 
 
   The monkey will teach you the SONATA OF AWAKENING, followed by some Deku 
Scrubs coming and throwing you out of the Deku Palace. If you wish, you 
can take the picture over to the Pictograph Box guy in the Photo Hut for a 
HEART PIECE or you can wait until later to drop it off. Take the lily pads to 
the right, but this time, jump to the platform with the Deku Launcher on it. 
Launch up to the cave entrance above your head, and go through it into the 
pathway to the Woodfall Temple.  (Note: The latest version of this guide can 
always be found at game faqs dot com.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                Woodfall Temple 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Small Key, Dungeon Map, Compass, Fairy (15) 
Songs: Song of Soaring 
Heart Pieces: 1 
 
   As you first enter, shoot bubbles at the Dragonfly that is coming at you. 2 
shots will kill it. Use the Deku Launchers to go from platform to platform 
until you reach the end. You will find a big slab of rock, read it to learn 
the SONG OF SOARING, which allows you to warp to any owl location you've 
been to (to gain an owl location, hit an owl statue with your sword whenever 
you see one.) Launch across the waterfall, and go through the opening into a 
water-filled area. Take the path to the right, killing the charging enemies 
that come at you (2 shots with the bubble shooter.) If you launch over to a 
lone platform on the left side of the room (it has a treasure chest on it) you 
can get a HEART PIECE. Launch over to the platform near the north of this 
area. 
 
   As Deku Link, stand on the little platform and play the Sonata of Awakening. 
A large structure will rise from the watery depths below will rise, allowing 
you to launch over and enter it. This is the Woodfall Temple. In each dungeon, 
you must find a total of 15 fairies hidden within, if you find them all, you 
rewarded. Once you get inside the dungeon, put on the Great Fairy Mask to 
attract Fairy #1. Morph into Deku Link, and use the Deku Launchers to go 
across the platforms. On the 2nd platform there is a treasure chest containing 
Fairy #2. Continue to the last platform, and go through the door. Walk down 
the ramp on the left, and kill the plant down below for Fairy #3. Use the 
Venus fly trap plants in the water to get to the door on the other side. 
 
   Before entering the door, hop to the platform on the right with a bunch 
of pots on it. Break one of them to get Fairy #4, then go back and through 
the door. Use the Deku Launcher in the center of the room to float up to the 
ledge where you will receive a SMALL KEY inside the treasure chest. Use the 
Deku Launcher to go into the next room (the doors will bar when you enter.) 
You must kill these 3 enemies in order to leave the room, and unless you have 
bombs, you'll have to use the Deku Launchers to your advantage. Burrow into 
a Deku Launcher and wait for the enemy to cross over you, then launch up on 
them to kill them. When they are all defeated, the door will open and you 
will receive the DUNGEON MAP from the treasure chest. 
 
   Make your way back to the main room, hopping across the Venus fly trap 
plants, over to the locked door. Use your small key to open it, and go through 
into the next area. Push the box that's blocking your way forward a little bit, 
then take the right twisted path until you come to the Skulltulla that drops 
from above. Kill it to get Fairy #5, then continue along the path, pushing the 
block out of your way once again. Go back to where you killed the Skulltulla, 
make sure you are young Link, and put on your Bunny Hood. Light a Deku Stick 
with the fire, then run along the path, and light the un-lit torch to open 
the door. Go inside, to find 2 dragonflies, kill them using the Deku Launchers, 
and collect the COMPASS in the chest. 
 
   Leave back into the room you were just in, transform back into normal Link, 
and put on the Bunny Hood. Light another stick with the fire, then run up the 
stairs, and light the un-lit torch at the top (watch out for the bats, they may 
knock you off the edge of the cliff.) Jump across the gap over to the middle 
platform (you can jump farther when wearing the Bunny Hood) then jump to the 
left to burn the cobwebs blocking your path. Kill the plants, and continue 
north up the stairway. Go through the hallway, and into a very dark room. Kill 
all the Black Boes to gain Fairy #6 from a treasure chest. Once finished 
doing that, light a Deku Stick with the torch in the middle of the room, then 
run around the edges of the room to light the 3 torches. 
 
   This will open the barred door, allowing you to pass. In this next room, 
just ignore the dragonflies, and use the Deku Launchers to cross the room. 
If you are hit by a dragonfly, and you don't fall all the way down through the 
hole, you can just use the stairs to climb back up, otherwise you'll have to 
use your map to get back up. Once across the gap, go down the stairway, and 
step on the switch as normal Link. 2 ladders will appear, but first go through 
the door right in front of you. Take the right path, and go through the door 
to engage in a mini-boss fight with Metal Dinalfos. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Metal Dinalfos 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Hero's Bow, 30 Arrows 
 
   This is semi-easy battle. The Metal Dinalfos only has 2 basic attacks. First 
he will slash at you with his weapon, then after you give him a shot when it's 
safe to do so, he will breath a stream of fire. To defend his attacks, use 
your shield (Left) and then attack when he does his leap attack. When you hit 
him, he will blow fire at you, just back away to avoid this one. Continue this 
method until he's defeated, where a treasure chest will then appear. Open it 
to gain the HERO'S BOW already equipped with 30 ARROWS. Leave back out through 
this door, and test out your new arrow. 
 
   Use your new Hero's Bow by aiming at the eyeball across the room. Shoot it 
to make the middle platform down below start moving up and down. Transform 
into Deku Link, and launch over to the platform, then launch to the ledge 
from there. Go through the door and another mini-boss battle will engage, this 
time it's with Gekko. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Gekko 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Boss Key 
 
   A bit more difficult now. First, hit Gekko a couple of times, he will then 
summons his buddy, who will aid him in battle. As Deku Link, burrow into a 
Deku Launcher and wait for the snapper to come over you, then launch to knock 
Gekko off. Now is your chance to hit him, use Z-Targeting and your Fairy 
Bow, hit him, then transform back into Deku Link and repeat the process until 
he dies, opening the barred door. Go through, and open the chest to receive 
the BOSS KEY. Leave these 2 rooms, and go back to the main room. Stand on the 
little switch you stood on earlier, and shoot and arrow through the fire, so 
it lights the torch on the very large flower in the middle of the room. If 
done correctly, the flower will begin to spin. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                          Woodfall Temple (Continued) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Run around to the other side of the upper level, break the bubble to get 
Fairy #7, and jump across onto the spinning flower. This part will be a bit 
tougher, because you have to have precise aim. Aim your arrow so it is aligned 
with the un-lit torch on the lone platform across the way. When the flower spins 
in front of it, shoot the arrow and hope it lights. Once it's lit, the door 
will open, allowing you to go through. Launch over to the platform with the 
rupees on it, and kill the 2 dragonflies. Now, fly back over, and go up the 
ledges on the right side of the wall, via the Deku Launchers. Collect Fairy 
#8 on the way. Go up the left side to get Fairy #9. Head back up the right 
side, and fly over to the lone platform. Pop the bubble with your arrow, and 
use the Great Fairy Mask to get Fairy #10. 
 
   Transform back into Deku Link, fly back to the top platform, and shoot an 
arrow at the crystal across the room, this will turn the fire off on top of 
each of the pillars. Quickly transform back into Deku Link, launch down to the 
lower platform, from there launch to the 2nd pillar, and finally over to the 
boss door. Take off the Deku Mask, break the pots, then go inside to fight 
the first actual boss, Odolwa. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Odolwa (Dungeon Boss) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Heart Container 
Masks: Guardian Mask #1 
Songs: Ode to Order 
 
   Odolwa has a primary weapon (a huge sword) but comes equipped with several 
attacks. Start off by hitting him several times on the legs with your sword. 
Once he starts summoning skulltullas from above, start using your arrows. 
When you have a clear shot in view, shoot him with an arrow, and continue this 
method of attack until you run out of arrows. Once again, hit him on the legs 
with your sword, and watch out for his fire ring and gnats. When he spreads a 
ring of fire around you, just stand there to avoid being hit. He will also use 
his sword attacks, which can easily be dodged, and finally he uses gnats and 
skulltulla's to attack you (these are a good source of hearts when you are low 
on energy.) After your 3 repeated attacks, he will be defeated. 
 
   Collect the HEART CONTAINER, then step on the glowing ground, where you will 
gain the GUARDIAN MASK #1, as well as learn the ODE TO ORDER song on your 
Ocarina, which will remove all poisonous water when played. You will then 
be transported to the lair where the Deku Princess is locked up. When you are 
left to play again, cut the vines blocking the path, and go into the room to 
engage in a conversation with the Deku Princess. Use your empty bottle to 
catch her, then leave back to the Deku Palace. Go to the throne room (where 
the Deku king is located) and release the Princess. The monkey will be free 
to go, and that's that. Now it's time to collect some optional items again. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                        Woodfall Temple Fairy Locations 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
1. Directly in front of you when you enter - wear the Great Fairy Mask to 
   get it. 
 
2. Inside the chest in the first room of the dungeon as you're flying over 
   the pit. 
 
3. Kill the Deku Baba next to the locked door in the second room with the 
   giant flower. 
 
4. Smash all the pots in the far corner of the giant flower room. 
 
5. When you collect the first Small Key, shoot the beehive on the left of 
   it with a bubble then wear the Great Fairy Mask. 
 
6. Under the platform with the stone block on it. When you light the torch 
   on the giant flower, the poison in the water disappears, allowing you to 
   collect it. 
 
7. Inside a beehive above the giant stone block - shoot them with bubbles. 
 
8. Kill the Skulltula in the stone block room. 
 
9. In the dark passage, wipe out the Black Boes to make a chest appear. 
 
10. Burst the bubble on the ledge above the giant flower, then wear the 
    Great Fairy mask. 
 
11. Fly over to the switch behind the un-lit torch above the giant flower, 
    then drop down and open the chest. 
 
12. On the third ledge up on the left of the large room before Odolwa. 
 
13. On the first ledge up on the right of the large room before Odolwa. 
 
14. On the third ledge up on the right of the large room before Odolwa. 
 
15. On the flaming pillar in the large room before Odolwa. Hit the crystal 
    switch, fly to the right-hand pillar before flying left to the fairy. 
 
(Thanks to The 64 Chimp) 
 
 
   After collecting all the dungeon fairies, return to the platform that you  
played the Sonata of Awakening on.  As Deku Link, burrow into the Deku 
Launcher, and turn the camera (using the joystick) until you see the cave in 
the southeast wall.  Fly to the stump with the Deku Launcher on it, then use 
that Deku Launcher to fly to the Fairy Fountain.  When you return all 15 
fairies from the Woodfall Temple, the Great Fairy of Power will give you a more 
advanced spin attack for Normal Link's sword.  (Before, you could only charge 
blue, now you can charge blue, then hold longer, and charge red, which uses 
more magic power but in turn does more damage)  This works with every sword.

                        Item Collection #2 (The Swamp)* 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Quiver (40), Bomb Bag, 20 Bombs 
Masks: Mask of Scents, Kamaro's Mask 
Heart Pieces: 2 
 
   In the Deku Palace, transform into normal Link and put on the Bunny Hood, 
take the left path (you can swim through the water now) and go through the now 
open cave. Talk to the Deku Scrub inside, and he will challenge you to a race. 
If you manage to keep up with him all through the cave (using the Bunny Hood) 
he will reward you at the end with the MASK OF SCENTS. Leave the Deku Palace, 
and go back to the Photo Hut, as normal Link, talk to Kotake at the hole in 
the wall, but instead of giving you a normal boat ride, she will give you a 
little mini-game to play. You will ride the fairy all the way around The Swamp, 
and back to the Photo Hut, along the way, Kotake will follow with a target 
hanging from the end of her broom. 
 
   Your goal here is to hit at least 20 targets before the ride is over. If 
you hit Kotake a maximum of 10 times, you automatically lose. It costs 10 
rupees to play again, so make sure you have enough money. Once you hit the 
target at least 20 times, you will be rewarded with a HEART PIECE. You 
are pretty much finished with The Swamp area for now, so head back to Clock 
Town. Go over to the Archery Game building to play for 20 rupees. Your goal 
here is to hit at least 30 red Octoroks before the time is up. If you succeed, 
you will gain a new QUIVER that now carries 40 arrows. On the 1st day, 
at 12AM, take the north exit of Clock Town, and follow along the fence to the 
left. You will see a man dancing on top of a mushroom-shaped platform. 
 
   Play the Song of Healing to cure him, and you will gain the KAMARO'S MASK. 
Make your way back into Clock Town, and on the 1st or 2nd day, go to the left 
part of town, wearing the Kamaro's Mask in front of the dancing twins, press 
B to teach them a new dance to get another HEART PIECE. In this same area, 
go into the Bomb Shop, where you can buy a new BOMB BAG for 50 rupees, and it's 
already filled with 20 BOMBS. Take the north exit of Clock Town, and go 
straight. 
 
*Most items here are optional, but I suggest you collect them for future use 
 in the game, that way you won't have to come back later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Mountain Village/Goron Shrine 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Snowhead Map, Lens of Truth 
Masks: Goron Mask 
Songs: Goron Lullaby 
 
   Go down into the snow area, and up the ramp where you will be blocked by 
some icicles. Z-Target the icicle above, and shoot 2 arrows at it so it will 
fall and break the ones blocking your path. Continue into the next area, using 
your map as a reference of where to go. You will now be blocked by some big 
snowballs. Use a bomb to get rid of them and continue along the path, until 
you finally arrive at Mountain Village. Head northwest to find the owl statue, 
hit it with your sword to remember your place. Talking to the Goron on the 
platform reveals that he's hungry and wants some food, but you'll get to 
that later. Death Mountain has frozen over and if you don't help fix it, all 
the Gorons will die off. Find the path you haven't gone through yet, which 
will lead you to a series of bridges. 
 
   On the 2nd bridge, you will see the elf who sells maps floating with this 
balloon. Shoot and arrow at it to make him fall, and buy a SNOWHEAD MAP for 
20 rupees. Continue along the bridges and into the next area. Walk down the 
little wooden bridge and jump off the cliff to the lower grounds where you 
will find the (real) owl perched on a wooden post. He will fly across the gap, 
leaving feathers on each invisible platform. Using his feathers as a guideline, 
jump across each invisible platform and go through the cave at the end. Chop 
up the bushes for some bombs, then open the treasure chest to gain the LENS 
OF TRUTH. Put on the lens of truth and blow up some of the boulders in here 
to find some extra rupees. 
 
   Leave this cave, and use the Lens of Truth to see the invisible platforms, 
cross back over them and onto the other side, where you will now see the ghost 
of a Goron (who died because of the cold weather, you can only see him when the 
Lens of Truth is on.) He will ask you to follow him to the Goron graveyard. 
Remove the Lens of Truth and follow his shadow, periodically using the Lens 
of Truth in order to continue (when you see his shadow stop moving, put on the 
Lens of Truth to make him start walking again.) He will lead you all the way 
to where you first entered, and over to some platforms in the water. From here, 
put on the Lens of Truth, and jump across the water. You will now be able to 
see the invisible ladder, so climb up to the top (moving left and right at the 
forks) and go into the graveyard. 
 
   Talk to the goron ghost, then play the Song of Healing to remove his curse, 
and you will gain the GORON MASK which allows you to transform into a Goron 
whenever you want. Put on the mask, and pull the tombstone from the back, which 
will ventilate a pool of hot water into the graveyard. Turn back into normal 
Link, and fill your bottle with hot water, go outside the cave and dump it on 
the frozen Goron to revive him. Go back in and get some more hot water in the 
bottle, then put on your Bunny Hood, leave the cave, do a dive into the water 
below and go all the way back to where you got the map (you must be quick, or 
the water will turn cold.) Go down to the lower area here (where the giant 
snowballs are) and go near the north end. 
 
   As Goron Link, punch the giant snowball to reveal an old, frozen Goron. 
Dump the hot water on him to revive him, then talk to him as Goron Link. 
You won't get much from him yet, first you must continue into the next area. 
Head to the lower grounds until you see a closed door. Do the Goron Stomp to 
open it (A + B) and go inside (alternatively, you can talk to another goron 
up on the mountain and he will do the Goron Stomp to open the door for you, 
but it's much easier to do it yourself.) You will hear a baby crying. Talk to 
all the people in the Shrine, then go up to the top level and talk to the 
baby. 
 
   Now, leave the shrine and go back to where the old frozen Goron was. He 
will be frozen once again, so get more water and unfreeze him (you can get water 
from the hole in the ground here once you get rid of the ice.) Talk to him and 
he will teach you part of the Goron Lullaby (he forgot the ending to it.) 
Once you've learned the first part, go back into the area you just came from, 
use the Goron Stomp to open the secret door and go inside once again. Head 
straight up to the baby, and play what you know of the Goron Lullaby to make 
the baby stop crying. He will teach you the ending of the song, then fall 
asleep along with the other 2 gorons in this room. Leave Goron Shrine back 
to the main area (where the log cabin is) and take the northwest path. 
 
   Before, this area was inaccessible because of the gaps. Now, as Goron Link, 
you can roll over them. Go up the path, avoiding the rolling snowballs and 
rolling over the gaps. Soon you will come to a new area, known as the Snowhead 
Dungeon, when you first enter, hit the owl statue with your sword. Looking 
straight ahead with the Lens of Truth shows that a giant Goron is blowing his 
breath making it impossible for you to pass. Take out your ocarina as Goron 
Link and play the Goron Lullaby to make him fall asleep and get out of the way. 
Go up the spiral ramp which leads to the Snowhead Temple itself, go inside. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                Snowhead Temple 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Dungeon Map, Small Key (2), Compass, Fairy (15) 
Mini-Bosses: Wizrobe (Phase 1), Wizrobe (Phase 2) 
Bosses: Goht 
 
   When you first enter, you will see a block hidden by some icicles. Punch 
them (as Goron Link) to get rid of them, then push the block inward. In the 
next room, kill the wolf and go through the door on the right. This room holds 
a bridge with molten lava below. Back up all the way, and charge up Goron 
Link's roll ability, then when no more icy breath is being blown, roll across 
the gap in the bridge and onto the other side. Transform into normal Link and 
jump over to the platform, then go through the door. Open the treasure chest 
inside this room to receive the DUNGEON MAP, as well as pick up Fairy #1 on 
the side of the room. Go back out, and into the other door. Run straight 
across the platform here and into the next room. 
 
   To the right, you will notice a stack of 2 blocks on the wall. Pull them 
out to reveal a hidden room, with a treasure chest inside. Open the chest to 
get a SMALL KEY, then leave back through the door you came in. The only 
opening left is the stairs, take them down to the lower level. Run around here 
until you find a switch in a lava pit, step on it as Goron Link to make a 
treasure chest appear in another lava pit. Open the chest to get a fairy. 
Head back up the stairs, and through the blue door you first came through. 
Spin back across the bridge (or climb the ladder if you fall) and go back to 
the first room. Unlock the door across the way, and once in the next room, open 
the chest to get the COMPASS, then bomb the cracked wall as normal Link. 
 
   Go up the stairs and hop up on the first platform in the next room. Watch 
out for the icicles above, and jump to the next open platform. You will see 
some white ice on the wall, jump over to it and you will crawl into a hidden 
area with a treasure chest, containing another Fairy. Jump down, and hop onto 
the ledge on the other side of the room. Use Z-Targeting and fire 2 arrows 
at the icicle hanging in the middle of the room. It will cause the ice block 
on the middle platform to break, allowing you to jump across and break open 
the giant snowball revealing a treasure chest with a SMALL KEY inside. Hop 
down and go through the once locked door. This room contains a little puzzle 
for you to figure out. 
 
   See those circular platforms all over the room? Stand on the first one as 
Goron Link, then do the Goron Stomp to press it down, causing the one in the 
little ditch to rise. Transform back into normal Link, and jump across to the 
other side. As Goron Link again, step on the other circular platform and do 
the same thing. This time, a smaller platform will rise in the ditch, and you 
will only have a limited time before it goes down. Run over to the first 
platform you rose in the ditch, Goron Stomp on it to make it go down, then 
as normal Link, quickly hop onto the small platform and up to the other side 
where you can now go through the door. 
 
   Roll across the gap in the bridge over to the other side. You will see a 
pile of snow against the wall, roll across it to the other side of the 
bridge. Don't go through the door here, but instead look straight across and 
roll across another gap, then go through the door at the other side to engage 
in a mini-boss battle with Wizrobe (Phase 1.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Wizrobe (Phase 1) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Fire Arrows 
 
   Wizrobe only has one attack: shooting a giant ball of frozen ice and you, 
causing Link to freeze. There are 4 teleportation pads on the ground that he 
uses to move. Once you see him on a pad, quickly run over to him as Goron Link 
and give him a Fire Punch (before he shoots the ball of ice at you.) 
Alternatively, as normal Link, you can shoot arrows at him, but they do little 
damage and you'll end up wasting a lot of time and energy. Continue this method 
of attack until Wizrobe becomes upset and clones himself 3 times. Now there 
will be 3 clones and 1 real at the teleport pads, he's not too hard to find, 
since his clones are transparent. Continue attacking the same way you have been 
and he will soon be defeated, leaving you the Fire Arrows in a chest. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Snowhead Temple (Continued) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Small Key 
 
   Roll back over the gap and the snow pile, and drop down to the lower level 
(where the platform is.) Use your new fire arrows to melt the ice blocks in 
front of each door. Go through the one to the right of where you got the first 
small key. First thing you need to do in here is melt all of the ice breath 
enemies here (there are 3 of them, shoot fire arrows to melt them) and a chest 
will appear containing a fairy on the other side of the room. Next, using the 
fire arrows, light all 3 un-lit torches before one goes out and you will have 
access to a new room. Go through the door in the middle and transform into 
Goron Link so you can Goron Stomp the circular platform here. 
 
   Doing so results in the main platform rising all the way to the roof of 
this icy dungeon. Go back to the room with the ice breath enemies and the 
broken bridge. Melt all 3 of the enemies to make a chest appear, melt the 
ice block to get to the chest, and open it revealing a SMALL KEY. Transform 
into normal Link if you aren't him already, and jump across to the small 
room where the Dungeon Map was. Stand on the platform in the middle of the 
room here, then shoot a fire arrow at the ice breath enemy up on the 2nd level, 
followed by another fire arrow to the eyeball switch, which will make the 
platform you are standing on rise up to the 2nd level, allowing you to jump 
off and go through the next door. 
 
   This leads back to the main room with the platform that was risen to the 
top of the dungeon. Since you can't roll across the gaps anymore (because 
the platform is blocking your way) you must use the snow piles on the sides 
of the walls. Go up all the stairways, rolling over snow when needed until you 
get to the top of the dungeon, go past the snowmen, then go through the locked 
door. From here, go through the door and into a new room with 2 dinalfos in it. 
Kill them both, and continue through the next open door. Now you will engage in 
another mini-boss battle, and it's with the same guy again, Wizrobe. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Wizrobe (Phase 2) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Boss Key 
 
   You'll be using the same tactics you did the first time, the only difference 
is now Wizrobe has 6 platforms to teleport with instead of just 4 like the 
first time. As he comes out of a teleportation pad, give him a fire punch as 
Goron Link (or use arrows, but punching is faster and easier.) After a few hits 
he will once again clone himself, but this time he'll have 5 clones instead of 
3 (the clones are transparent, so he's easy to find) continue attacking like 
you have been until he is finally defeated for the 2nd time. Collect the Boss 
Key from the treasure chest, and leave this room. You must now lower the 
main platform in order to gain access to the boss' lair. 
 
   Head down to the bottom of the platform room (ground level of this dungeon) 
and you will see 2 blue colored sections of the platform. As Goron Link, fire 
punch each one of them out, causing the platform to decrease in size. Go back 
up to the top of the platform room, and do the same thing with the last 2 blue 
sections, until the platform is so small that you can reach the boss' lair. 
>From the top, jump down onto the platform, and roll through the giant snowballs 
into the next room. Do a spiked roll across the gap in the bridge and use your 
Boss Key to begin the next boss fight. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Goht 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Heart Container 
Masks: Guardian Mask #2 
 
   When you first enter, you will see a horse frozen in a giant block of ice, 
this is Goht. Melt him with a fire arrow to start the battle. This battle 
strategy is rather simple, all you do is run around in circles, ramming Goht 
as Goron Link until he dies. There is a bit more to it, however, Goht will 
throw a lot of obstacles in your way, such as rocks, bombs, boulders, spikes, 
etc. All you have to do is constantly do a spiked roll, chasing Goht around 
in circles, running into his back-side until he dies. Rocks will not hurt you 
if you roll into them, and you can collect magic from the pots. Once he's 
defeated you will gain another Heart Container and the 2nd Guardian Mask. After 
that, all the ice in Goron Shrine will melt, meaning you've saved the Gorons!

                      Item Collection #3 (Goron Shrine)* 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Bottle, Gold Dust 
Masks: Don Gero Mask 
Heart Pieces: 4 
 
   First thing you'll want to do is pick up the new mask, which can only be 
done before defeating Goht. Before you go into the Snowhead Temple, go over 
to the Goron Shrine (where the crying baby is) and you will notice several 
un-lit torches all throughout the village. Go up to the room where the baby is, 
light a deku stick and run through the Shrine with your Bunny Hood lighting 
each torch, until they are all lit. A big structure up on the ceiling with lots 
of pots will begin to spin, and _your_ goal is to break the pots for something 
special. As Goron Link, do a spiked roll from the top level of Goron Shrine 
and break each pot 1 by 1, going back up to the top each time. Once they are 
all broken, a piece of meat will fall from the last one. 
 
   The meat is too big to carry as normal Link, so you'll have to be Goron 
Link to pick it up. Take this piece of meat to the hungry Goron you talked to 
earlier in the main part of Goron Shrine (the one standing on the platform) 
and throw it to him. He will gobble it up, and in return give you a new mask 
which allows you to talk to frogs, the DON GERO MASK. Go back to Clock Town, 
put on the Don Gero Mask, and talk to the frog in the lake area. There are a 
total of 5 frogs you must talk to with this mask. One you just talked to, 
the next appears after you defeat Goht in the Snowhead Temple, the 3rd and 
4th are in the 2 dungeons, after you defeat Gekko, they appear, and the final 
one is in the swamp next to the Photo Hut (after defeating Odolwa.) 
 
   Once you've talked to all 5, the one in Goron Shrine will reward you with 
a HEART PIECE. After defeating Goht, and Goron Shrine has melted back 
into it's normal self, head over to the area with the actual Goron Shrine is. 
You will see a cave opening now, go inside to find the Giant Goron. Talk to him 
as Goron Link and he will give you a giant barrel of dynamite, pick it up and 
walk all the way back to where the frozen old goron was earlier in the game. 
Near the entrance of this area is a huge rock on top of some steep platforms. 
Use the dynamite stick to blow it up and go through to the Goron Races. To 
partake in a race, just talk to the baby Goron and you will be entered. 
 
   Roll through the course, collecting magic from the green jars, and if you 
end up placing in first, you will receive another BOTTLE with some GOLD DUST 
inside. Later on in the game (after you get the Zora Mask) make sure you come 
back to Goron Shrine, and in the area where the old frozen Goron was, you can 
find a treasure chest underwater containing a HEART PIECE but you can only 
get it with the Zora Mask. Go back near Clock Town until you are walking along 
Milk Road. You will find some grass here, walk through it and you will fall 
through a hidden hole into a room with an enemy. As normal Link, bomb it to 
make it fly, then, as Goron Link, fire punch it continuously to defeat it and 
collect another HEART PIECE. 
 
   Near each of the 4 exits of Clock Town are holes in the ground, you'll have 
to find them within the radius of the town exit. In each one there is a large 
gossip stone, which you can play the Goron Lullaby to, and it will turn red 
in color. Do this to the remaining 3 stones in the other areas (one near each 
exit of Clock Town) and you will be rewarded with a HEART PIECE. If you wish, 
you can also upgrade your sword now, see the "Side Quests" section on how to 
do that. Now, it's time to get your horse back! 
 
 
*Most items here are optional, but I suggest you collect them for future use 
 in the game, that way you won't have to come back later. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Romani Ranch 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Epona, Bottle, Normal Milk 
Songs: Epona's Song 
Masks: Romani Mask 
 
   Now that Goron Shrine is no longer an ice tomb, head over to the area past 
where you got the map. Once here, go to the giant Goron in his cave for the 2nd 
time (1st if you didn't go to the Goron Races yet) and you will gain 1 giant 
bomb for free (after the first time, he will charge 100 rupees per bomb.) With 
this new bomb, warp to the owl statue near Milk Road, and take the bomb over to 
where the man is chopping a big rock. Place the bomb on the rock to explode it 
and go through to Romani Ranch (making sure it's still the first day, if not 
you'll have to warp back in time.) Talk to the smaller girl (Romani) outside 
and you will see some UFOs abducting a cow, then you will be able to play a 
little challenge with your horse, Epona. 
 
   Your goal is to pop 10 red, floating balloons while riding horseback. Ignore 
the clock, as you have unlimited time to complete this challenge. Once you've 
popped them all, you will learn EPONA'S SONG from Romani, as well as get your 
horse, EPONA back (by playing Epona's Song, Epona will come to you no matter 
where you are in Termina.) Now you can play some mini-games. Warp ahead 12 
hours, and wait until it is 2AM, Romani will come out of her house and go 
into the barn to guard the animals from UFOs. Go outside, and the UFOs will 
appear shortly. Your goal here is to fend them off and make sure none of them 
get to the barn. You can only kill them with arrows, and they come from all 
sides of the barn. Continue killing them off until it's 5:30 AM. 
 
   Once 5:30 hits, you will gain another BOTTLE filled with NORMAL MILK. 
Next, you can play a bodyguard! Talk to Romani and her sister inside their 
house on the morning of the 2nd day and they will ask you to guard them from 
thieves while they deliver milk to Clock Town. If you want to, go back to 
their house at 6:00 PM on Day 2 to play this mini-game. Using your arrows, fend 
off the thieves as you see them while on the way to Clock Town. If you manage 
to make it safely, you will receive the ROMANI MASK. Now, it's time to start 
with the next dungeon, so get on your horse and begin riding towards the 
beach area near the west side of clock town. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              Great Bay/Zora Hall 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Great Bay Map, Red Potion 
Masks: Zora Mask, Stone Mask 
Heart Pieces: 1 
 
   If you wish, you can buy a GREAT BAY MAP from the elf near Milk Road, but 
you don't have to if you don't want to. Once you get to the beach, hop over 
the fence with Epona and continue going until you reach the Great Bay. Park 
your horse, and then look out into the ocean to see a gathering of birds. 
Swim out to the birds to find a Zora who is lying face first into the water. 
Talk to him, then get behind him and push him all the way to the shore, where 
he will walk a few steps onto the beach and collapse. Talk to him, then play 
the Song of Healing and you'll view a short cinema showing the story of his 
band, the Japas. Following that, the ZORA MASK will be yours. Transform into 
a Zora, and swim out to the structure you see out in the ocean. 
 
   You cannot climb onto the platform normally, so you'll have to do a diving 
jump onto it, to do so, swim underwater from a little way back, then press down 
on the Joystick to go down, and immediately press up on the Joystick to do a 
diving jump and you'll land on the platform. Transform back into normal Link 
and hit the owl statue with your sword to remember your spot, then swim back 
to the beach. Go through the opening to the right into the next area, where 
you will find a structure with the tail of a mermaid on top out in the ocean. 
Swim out to this structure, and sink to the bottom (press the B button) where 
you will find an enemy blocking your path. Hit it 3 times with your swords 
to kill it, then continue through into Zora Hall. 
 
   There really isn't much to do here as of yet. Once you get the hookshot 
later in the game, make sure you come back here to help out the Japas (band) 
and you'll get another HEART PIECE, but for now, all you can do is find 
the owl statue. Go into the 2nd opening, and take the path to the left of the 
shop where you will find Lulu along with an owl statue. Talk to her 
as Zora Link, then hit the owl statue as normal Link. From where you are, play 
the Song of Soaring and warp to the owl statue in Clock Town. Take the south 
exit, and go to the Swamp, where you can buy a RED POTION from Koume for 20 
rupees. Once you have the potion, warp back to clock town and take the exit 
to the east. Play Epona's Song, then ride Epona straight through to the 
mountain terrain area. 
 
   Hop over the 2 fences you come to (don't worry about the bomb enemies, you 
can just run over them with Epona and no damage will be done to yourself nor 
Epona) and equip the Lens of Truth. To the right, you will see a circle of 
stones, use the Lens of Truth here and you'll find a fatigued soldier who is 
in need of Red Potion. Talk to him, and press the C-Button holding the potion 
when he asks for it to give it to him. He will drink it and reward you with 
the STONE MASK which makes you invisible to Gerudo guards. Warp back 
to the first owl statue in Great Bay, then jump into the water and swim to the 
right of the owl statue until you reach the end (where the wall is.) Sink Down 
(press B) and walk towards the beach along the wall. 
 
   You will soon come to some boards along the wall (they have a skull with 
crossbones on them) which can be broken by underwater swimming into them. Break 
the second one from the left open and go through into the next area, climb out 
of the water, up the ramp and into the Gerudo Lagoon. As normal Link, put on 
the Stone Mask so the guards won't catch you. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Gerudo Lagoon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Hookshot, 7 Zora Eggs 
Heart Pieces: 1 
 
   Look over to the left, where you'll see some ramps leading out of the water. 
This is where you want to go. Jump down into the water, and hop onto a boat 
when it comes along. Let it take you to this area, where you can get off and 
go up the ramps. You'll notice a switch similar to the one in the Snowhead 
Dungeon earlier. Transform into Goron Link, and Goron Stomp the switch which 
causes the gate to open leading into an underwater maze. Below is a map of the 
maze, and the correct path to take: 
 
 
               FINISH 
                 == 
                 ===   ====== 
                 =     =---O= 
                 =     =|  |=                   X = Boards 
                 =     =|  ---X---\             O = Push/Pull Block 
                 =   ===|   =     |             --- First Path 
                 =   O---   =     |             === Second Path 
                 =          X     | 
                 ======X=====   START 
 
 
   Once you get to the end of the maze you'll find a pipe pumping sewage 
upward, hop over the pipe to be taken up to the next level. Swim through this 
area, avoiding the spikes on the ocean floor, and make sure you watch out for 
the pipes pumping sewage on the sides of the walls. If you get caught in one 
of them, it will push you out to the entrance of Gerudo Lagoon, and you'll have 
to go through the maze again (even though it'll be easy because you moved all 
the blocks already.) Hop up onto the ledge, and go through the door into the 
next room, avoid the spikes and go up the ramps onto dry land once again. 
You'll see a set of stairs, climb them and Fire Punch the barrels as Goron 
Link to reveal a hidden switch. 
 
   Step on the switch to open the locked door to the jail cell down below, 
then quickly roll down the stairs and into the cell before the door closes 
and collect the HEART PIECE. Go back up the stairs, and stand on the edge 
of the platform as normal Link, then fire an arrow at the switch on the 
platform across the way. This will open the gate below for a short time, so 
transform into Zora Link, dive into the water and quickly swim through the 
opening into the next area. Avoiding the bombs, swim _over_ the pipe pumping 
sewage and continue through the corridor until you come to a ladder. Climb 
it to come to a room with a switch, and a grated pipe on the ground. Step on 
the switch which will open another switch on the wall. 
 
   Quickly stand on the grated pipe and shoot an arrow at the switch on the 
wall before it closes. This will cause water to flow through the grated pipe 
you're standing on, lifting you up to the next area. Watch out for the spikes 
above your head, they will fall if you step under them. Go over and climb the 
ladder, and fire an arrow at the switch to open the door below. Go through 
it to go outside again. Put on your Stone Mask, then walk along the 
ledge and go through the opening to get to the actual _inside_ of the Gerudo 
settlement. Hop down (with the Stone Mask on) and climb up the ladder 
in the middle of the settlement. Cross the bridge and go through the door on 
the other side (you may have to wait for the guard to cross before you can.) 
 
   You will view a cinema here showing a conversation between 2 Gerudo guards 
talking about how they kidnapped 7 Zora Eggs. Once the cinema is over, shoot 
an arrow at the beehive through the bars, causing it to fall and break open, 
spouting bees everywhere which will scare off the guards below. Go around the 
bend and hop down to this room. Open the treasure chest to get the HOOKSHOT. 
Now it's time to rescue those 7 stolen Zora Eggs. Make sure you have at least 
3 bottles (you can do it with one, but it will take A LOT longer) and you 
should also have upgraded to the Gilded Sword (see Side Quests section) but it 
isn't mandatory. You can do it with the Kokiri sword and 1 bottle if you wish, 
but it'll be a lot tougher than with them. 
 
   The FIRST ZORA EGG is right in this room (where you got the hookshot) in the 
tank over to the right. Use your hookshot on the ledge above the tank as normal 
Link to get up there, then as Zora Link, sink down in the water and capture 
the egg in a bottle. Now, it's time to get the SECOND ZORA EGG, and it's in 
another room of the Gerudo settlement. Go outside so you are in the main 
settlement (where the tower is) and make your way to the northwest area, using 
the poles with your hookshot to get up there. Go inside, wearing your Stone 
Mask (if you have it) and walk right past the patrolling gerudo guard, 
into the next room where you'll have to fight a guard. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Gerudo Guard 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   This is one easy fight if you have the Gilded Sword. Three slices from that 
baby and this guard is toast. If you were unfortunate and didn't pick up the 
sword, you're in for a little fight. Just attack her when possible and try to 
counter her attacks until you defeat her. Once she's defeated, she will throw 
a Deku Nut and magically disappear, unlocking the next door. Go through to find 
another tank with the Zora Egg in it. Using the hookshot on the ledge above, 
go up and dive down to get the egg in your 2nd empty bottle. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Gerudo Lagoon (Continued) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Songs: New Wave Bossa Nova 
 
   The THIRD ZORA EGG is on the right side of the settlement. Use your hookshot 
to get up there and go through the door. Go past the guard with your Stone 
Mask on and into the next room, going past all of the guards, and up the 
stairs to engage in another fight with a Gerudo guard. Since these guards are 
so easy, I'm not even going to consider them as mini-bosses. Fight her the same 
way you fought the other one until she is defeated and allows you to pass into 
the room with the tank. Use the hookshot on the ledge above the tank, and 
capture the 3rd egg in your last empty bottle. Since you can collect no more 
for the time being, play the Song of Soaring and warp to the first owl statue 
in the Great Bay (the first one you hit.) 
 
   Climb up the ladder and into the marine room. Climb up the ladder and drop 
each egg into the marine tank, one by one until all of your bottles are empty 
again. Now swim back to the Gerudo Lagoon and head back to the settlement to 
get the FOURTH ZORA EGG, which happens to be located in the back of the 
settlement. Use the hookshot poles to get up there, go through the door and 
fight the last gerudo guard. She is a bit tougher than the first 2, especially 
if you don't have the Gilded Sword. Try using bombs on her if you don't have 
the Gilded sword, followed by slashes from the Kokiri Sword. Once she's gone, 
go through into the tank room and capture the 4th egg, then warp back to the 
owl statue in Great Bay, go into the marine room and drop the egg into the 
marine tank, now for the remaining three eggs. 
 
   From the first owl statue in Great Bay, swim a little northeast to find two 
tall rocks sticking out of the water. As Zora Link, sink down and walk between 
the two rocks to be transported to a little maze behind them. This maze is 
a bit tough, because if you take the wrong path you are sent back to the 
beginning of the maze. Basically, it's a game of "follow the signs." Walk 
forward to the first sign, and follow it to the next sign. Then follow the 
arrow signs until you come to the 2nd arrow sign. Do NOT follow this one, but 
instead go past it to the one behind it, then follow the rest from there until 
you come to the end of the maze, and the entrance to an underwater cavern. 
 
   This cavern is very deep, and there are holes on the sides of the walls 
with eels in them. First, sink down to the very bottom, and wait for the eels 
to come out of their holes (there are 2 holes on each level) then throw your 
swords as Zora Link at them and hit them twice to kill them. One of them has 
the FIFTH ZORA EGG inside (you have to kill the eel to get it) and the other 
has either a treasure chest with rupees or pots with hearts. Float up to the 
next level and do the same thing, only now you'll have to land inside the hole 
(right next to the eel) and hit it when it comes out. Get the SIXTH ZORA EGG 
and float up to the top level, where you must kill the remaining 2 eels and 
collect the SEVENTH and final ZORA EGG in your last empty bottle. 
 
   Unfortunately, you cannot warp underwater, so you'll have to float back 
out of the cavern, but you don't have to go through that confusing maze again. 
Just walk anywhere and it will take you back to the 2 rocks, where you can 
then swim over to the owl statue or swim to the beach and warp there. Climb 
the ladder and go into the marine room. Drop off the last three eggs into the 
marine tank, and watch as they develop into tadpoles. Once they are all 
tadpoles, they will form musical notes on the ladder of their tank. As Zora 
Link, take out the Ocarina in front of the old guy and he will teach you the 
NEW WAVE BOSSA NOVA. Now, it's time to enter the next dungeon. Play the Song of 
Soaring and warp to the owl statue in Zora Cape. 
 
   As Zora Link, play the New Wave Bossa Nova to Lulu and she 
will sing it, causing a giant turtle (with palm trees on its back) to awaken 
from the depths of the ocean. Once the cinema is over, use the hookshot on one 
of the palm trees and the turtle will give you a free ride over to the Great 
Bay Dungeon, enter it when you get there. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               Great Bay Temple 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Dungeon Map, Compass, Small Key, Fairy (15) 
 
   There is a lot of machinery here, as you will soon notice. As Zora Link, hop 
into the water and swim over to the northeast corner, then sink down and pull 
the large turnkey to activate the water spout and the elevators. Swim back to 
the entrance and hop onto the elevator on the left. Hop across, kill the 
skulltullas above, then jump over onto the water spout and over to the other 
side. Walk through the small corridor and into the main core room (this room 
has the rotating blades, which causes the current in the water below.) Hop 
down into the water, but stay on the top level (swimming with the current) 
and go through the yellow opening. Once in this next room, kill a few of the 
skeleton fish, and float up to the red platform. 
 
   Use your hookshot on the treasure chest on the platform across the room and 
open it to get the DUNGEON MAP, then drop down to the bottom of the water as 
Zora Link and find the red corridor with 2 enemies blocking it. Use your 
swords to kill them, then go through the corridor to find some Deku Babas 
underwater (they hang from lilly pads.) Kill them off and go through the door 
on the other side. Use your hookshot on the treasure chest across the room, 
but make sure the dog with a bomb chained to him doesn't hit you or you may 
fall into the enemy infested waters below. Open the chest to get the COMPASS, 
then look down into the water to find some more Deku Babas. Kill them off with 
arrows or your swords (as Zora Link) followed by the enemy guarding the chest. 
 
   Once there are no more enemies, drop down and open the chest to get a SMALL 
KEY, then hop back up, and walk towards the door you came in. You will see a 
current just before the door, hop in and take it back to the main core room. 
 Sink down, go through the red corridor on the bottom, and float up to the top 
of the room once you enter. Search around the room until you see a red pipe 
coming up from the water. Walk up the pipe, kill the bomb dog and go through 
the locked door using your small key. There are a bunch of pots here, break 
them all and collect the goods, because you're getting ready for a pretty 
tough fight in the next room. Walk through the door, and look up to see the 
Big-Eye mini-boss. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Big-Eye 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Ice Arrows 
 
   Your goal is first to get rid of all the mini-eyeballs surrounding the giant 
one, which can be done using 5 methods: Shooting fire arrows at them, throwing 
bombs at them, going up and slicing them off, using the hookshot to bring 
them to you, or using the Blast Mask. The fire arrows method works best, but 
you will eventually run out of arrows or magic (you can collect more from the 
pots around the room.) Once you're out of magic/arrows, use your bombs, and 
once those are gone, just slice them off. Only use the Blast Mask as a last 
resort, because that does damage to Link. Try to fire some arrows into the 
giant eye when he opens it, just to do some early damage to him. Once the 
mini-eyeballs are all gone, he will start charging at you. 
 
   The easiest way to defeat him now is to use any remaining arrows you have, 
then just stand in one corner and wait for him to approach you. Give him a 
few slices to the eye (when he opens it) to do some more damage. Continue this 
a few more times until the eyeball explodes, leaving a treasure chest behind. 
Open it to get the ICE ARROWS, then leave this room and stock up on inventory 
from the pots again. Go back through the main core room and through the yellow 
corridor at the top until you make your way to the room where the compass was. 
Kill the Deku Baba hanging from the first 2 lilly pads, then hop over onto the 
first lilly pad as normal Link. Take out your Ice Arrows and fire a few into 
the water leading to the inaccessible room. This will create ice platforms for 
you to walk on, allowing you to get to the opening across the way. Hop up and 
break all the icicles, then shoot a fire arrow at the huge ice block, and go 
through the door to fight another mini-boss. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Gekko 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Boss Key 
 
   Apparently, Gekko didn't learn his lesson from the Woodfall Temple, but 
he is a bit tougher this time than he was before. Slash him once with your 
sword and all the blobs will combine on the ceiling with Gekko inside. If the 
big blob falls on Link, he will enter the blob with Gekko, followed by Gekko 
doing a series of attacks to Link ending with you losing a lot of health. To 
avoid this, fire an Ice Arrow at the giant blob _before_ it falls on Link, and 
it will fall and shatter, releasing Gekko. Repeat this process about 3 more 
times to kill Gekko, then talk to the frog left behind with the Don Gero Mask 
(this is one of the 5 frogs you talk to in order to get a heart piece.) Go 
through the open door, and open the chest to get the BOSS KEY. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Great Bay Temple (Continued) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Swim back to the main core room, and climb up one of the ladders on the side 
to get up higher. Now jump onto one of the spinning blades as it comes by and 
let it take you to a new platform, which you must climb up on quickly before 
you get knocked off. Shoot an Ice Arrow at the water on top of the water spout 
to make the ladder accessible, climb it and go into the next area. Use your 
hookshot on the wooden barrel over on the lone platform, then shoot Ice Arrows 
into the water to create ice platforms for you to cross over to the platform 
with the turnkey on it. Push/pull the key, then go back to the main core room. 
Take the yellow corridor on the top and float up into the room where you got 
the dungeon map. 
 
   Stand on the same platform the treasure chest is on and use ice arrows to 
make a pathway to the door across from you. Go inside and stand by the 
platform with the turnkey on it. Wait for the Blue Chucu (blob-like enemy) to 
come near you, then shoot an ice arrow at it to freeze it into a block of ice. 
Jump up onto it and over to the platform with the turnkey. Push/pull the key 
and go back to the main core room. Take the red corridor at the bottom and head 
over to one of the platforms in the corner. Stand on it and fire an ice arrow 
at the Octorok shooting rocks at you to freeze it. Transform into Zora Link 
and jump onto the frozen block and onto the platform with the turnkey on it. 
Push/pull the key, and head back to the first room in the dungeon. 
 
   Don't jump into the water, but instead look at the ceiling to your right 
to find a hookshot pad above the red water spout. Fire your hookshot up there 
to land on the water spout, then jump across to the platform and push/pull the 
turnkey. Hop down and go over to the yellow platform and turn that key to make 
the machine in the main core room run in reverse (causing the current to go 
in the other direction.) Go back to the main core room and sink down to the 
bottom, going through the green corridor (new one) and walk up the green 
pipe coming up from the water. Push/pull the turnkey and go back to the main 
core room, but this time, take the new corridor in the center. In the next 
room, go to the corner to find an elevator, hop on and jump over to the rod 
that's holding the blades, and jump once more to the next elevator. 
 
   This will take you over to the other side of the room, where you must walk 
to the end, and fire an Ice Arrow at the waterfall to freeze it and stop the 
blades from moving, however, there is a catch to it. You must stop it at the 
precise time the blades are lined up with the platform you are standing on, 
otherwise you won't be able to cross. Once you have it right, cross the blades 
and go through the door leading into the next room. Go to the other side of 
the room, stand on the see-saw and shoot a fire arrow at the ice above the 
other end of the see-saw causing the end you are standing on to rise. Jump 
across to the next see-saw, and do the same thing, then jump to the platform 
with the turnkey on it. 
 
   Push/pull it, and that's all the pushing and pulling you'll have to do for 
a long while. Head back to the main core room and take the green corridor on 
the bottom, and use the green water spout to get to the boss door, where you 
can use the Boss Key to enter the boss' lair. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Gyorg 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items Gained: Heart Container 
Masks Gained: Gyorg Guardian Mask 
 
   This is going to be one of the tougher battles in the entire game. Gyorg 
is a huge fish, capable of mass destruction. Jump down the hole to engage the 
battle, making sure you are Zora Link. Sink down in the water to find him, 
and use your swords (boomerangs, or whatever they are) and Z-Targeting to 
stun him, then walk up to him and hit him with your swords. It may sound easy, 
but don't forget that every attack has a counter attack. Gyorg has several 
tricks up his sleeve. His most devastating being the way he chews up Zora 
Link. Try to stay out of his path as best as possible, because once you get 
caught in his jaws, you are in for some major damage. If you die, make sure 
you stock up on hearts/fairies before coming back, otherwise he'll kill you 
instantly. 
 
   Alternatively (a much easier way) you can stand on the platform as normal 
Link and fire arrows down below at him to stun him, then transform into Zora 
Link, swim down and ram him with your shield to do at least 3-4 hits. After 
hitting him, swim back up, dolphin jump onto the platform and repeat. When 
standing on the platform, Gyorg becomes impatient and gives the platform a 
jolt, causing Link to fall down. This does no damage, but if you are standing 
too close to the edge, you may fall off and he'll grab you in his jaws. Beware 
of his mid-air leaps over the platform, or he may swallow you and spit you out 
(does the same amount of damage as chewing you underwater.) His last attack is 
calling a swarm of skeleton fish to attack you, which does massive damage. Try 
to avoid the above as best as possible, and use either method of attack until 
he's dead. Then collect the HEART CONTAINER and stand on the glowing orb to get 
the GYORG GUARDIAN MASK.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                        Item Collection #4 (Great Bay)* 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Bottle 
Masks: Chairman Mask 
Heart Pieces: 3 
 
   Warp to Clock Town, and head into the Milk Bar on any day at 10:00 PM (the 
Milk Bar is on the right side of town, it has a different door than normal 
buildings.) As normal Link, talk to the fat Zora, and he/she will give you a 
little music lesson. Stand on the correct light and he/she will give you a 
little piece of the song. Play it, then transform into Deku Link, stand on a 
light, and learn the next part of the song. Do the same thing as Goron Link 
and Zora Link so all the Links will play one song, and you will receive the 
CHAIRMAN MASK from the guy on the stool. Warp to the owl statue in Zora Hall, 
then go outside so you are in the 2nd area of Great Bay. Head to the right 
a bit (when facing away from the water) until you find some sticks. 
 
   Look up and you'll see a palm tree on a platform that you can hookshot up 
to as normal Link. Once up there, look across the way and hookshot to the next 
tree, followed by the next one, and continue going up until you get to a cave 
opening. Go inside, and dive down into the water. You will hear a buzzing 
noise, followed by the appearance of a beaver. Sink down as Zora Link and talk 
to him. He will challenge you to a little race, swimming underwater through 
20 rings, and if you can go through all 20 rings before time runs out, you 
win. Try to stick behind him as best as possible (he doesn't go that fast) 
and when you finish, he'll call his faster brother to challenge you through 
25 rings this time. 
 
   If you keep up with him and finish within the given time, the beaver 
brothers will reward you with a shiny new BOTTLE and depart. Talk to them 
to challenge them again, and if you win, you'll get a HEART PIECE. Warp to 
Zora Hall, and as Zora Link, enter the first room (the one that has the 
drummer in it) then transform into normal Link and hookshot up to the tree 
on the ledge above the drummer. Transform back into Zora Link and read the 
journal on the table up here to learn 2 parts of a song. They are: 
 
FIRST PART:   A, C-Down, C-Right, A 
SECOND PART:  C-Down, C-Right, C-Left, C-Down 
 
   Remember those and go into the next room to the right (where the guitar 
player is) and talk to him as Zora Link, then take out your Ocarina. He will 
play a part of the song, and you are to follow by playing the first part 
listed above. He then plays another part of the song, and you follow it with 
the second part listed above. These 2 combinations form the following 2 songs: 
 
FIRST SONG:   C-Right, C-Right, C-Down, A, A, C-Down, C-Right, A 
SECOND SONG:  C-Left, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Down, C-Right, C-Left 
 
   Finally, go into the next room to the right (the room with the pianist) 
and play both of the above songs together as normal Link to get a HEART PIECE. 
Exit Zora Hall, and swim back to the shore, then head over to the right area 
where the waterfall is. Dive down to the bottom of where the waterfall is to 
find a blob and 2 skeleton fish. Kill the fish, then give three shots to the 
blob and it will leave a HEART PIECE behind. That's about all you can do for 
now, however, there is a little mini-game after you defeat Gyorg. If you 
swim in between the first owl statue and the entrance to the Gerudo Lagoon, 
you will find a boat that you can ride. When it passes the island with a tree 
on it, hookshot to the tree, talk to the man and jump across the platforms 
20 times to get a prize. You can also play the Gold Skulltulla Quest #2 here, 
check out the "Side Quests" section for more. 
 
 
*Most items here are optional, but I suggest you collect them for future use 
 in the game, that way you won't have to come back later. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               Inside the Grave 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Warp to Clock Town and take the East exit, then play Epona's Song to call 
for Epona. Ride her up to the mountains, hopping over the fences as you go. 
Continue up through the Ikana Graveyard until you reach a skeleton at the end. 
Take out your Ocarina and play the Sonata of Awakening to make the skeleton 
rise from the dead. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Skeleton & Minions 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Masks: Captain's Hat 
 
   This guy reminds me of the skeleton boss in Castlevania 64. At first, he 
runs away from you, so chase after him. You see those things on the sides of 
the walls? That's where fire arises, and to get rid of the fire, you have to 
kill the 2 enemies that pop up. Fire arrows at the skeleton to slow him down 
until you eventually catch up to him. Hit him with your sword a few times, 
then shoot some Ice arrows at him to freeze him up, followed by sword slashes 
to the legs. After a few shots, he will give up and make peace with Link. He 
salutes you and then goes back underground, releasing the fire that is guarding 
the treasure chest across the way. Use your hookshot on the chest and open it 
to get the CAPTAIN'S HAT. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Inside The Grave (Continued) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Warp ahead 12 hours so it's night time on the 1st day. Head back to the 
Ikana Graveyard and put on the Captain's Mask. Go over to the tombstone near 
the entrance and talk to the mini-skeletons here. When they ask you if you 
want them to break the tombstone open, say yes and they will do it. Hop down 
into the inside of the grave. Hop across the two platforms and go through the 
opening into the next area. There are tons of Keese here (bats) and if you 
kill them all, you can get 50 rupees from a treasure chest. Once the keese are 
out of the way, shoot fire arrows at all three un-lit torches to unlock the 
next door. Go through to find Iron Knuckle.

MINI-BOSS: Iron Knuckle 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Songs: Song of Storms 
 
   Iron Knuckle is by far the strongest boss in the entire game, but due to 
his excessive lack of speed, he is a breeze to defeat. Z-Target him, then go 
close to make him swing his axe at you, but back away right when it comes down. 
Run up to him and give him 2 slashes from your Gilded sword (if you still don't 
have the Gilded sword, just use bombs on him.) Make sure you don't get hit by 
his axe, because it will do at least 6 hearts of damage to your meter, possibly 
more. After you hit him about 3 times, a part of his body will fall off, that 
means he's almost dead. Continue these attacks until he dies. Then go up to 
the gravestone that appears to learn the SONG OF STORMS (yep, the same one from 
Ocarina of Time.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Ikana Canyon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Masks: Garo Mask, Mask of Gibdo 
 
   Before going any further, you'll have to pick up the Garo Mask. Warp to 
the owl statue near Milk Road, and take the path left of the statue. If you 
don't have Epona with you, play her song and bring her along. Talk to the 
farmers here and for 10 rupees, you can race them around the obstacle course. 
The race is a bit challenging, but not too tough. My only advice to you is 
never, _ever_ use up all your carrots. Leave at least one, because once you 
use them all, it takes at least 10 seconds to regain them. Race around the 
track, jumping when necessary. You can take several shortcuts but cutting 
corners, jumping fences etc. but make sure you are going fast enough so you'll 
make it all the way over the fence you plan to jump. 
 
   When it comes near the end of the race, avoid the mud pits, because they 
slow you down and use up all your carrots to (hopefully) win the race. Shortly 
after that, the farmers will cough up the GARO MASK. Ride Epona over to the 
mountain terrain area again, and take her to the area just before the graveyard, 
but just after the 2 fences you jump over. On the right cliff you will see a 
man who looks like the Garo Mask sitting. Put on the Garo Mask and talk to him 
to make him create a tree for you to hookshot onto. Hookshot up there, and 
cross through the falling boulder canyon (try not to take too much damage 
here) until you get to Ikana Canyon (also known as "Ekhana Canyon.") If you are 
wearing your Garo Mask, you will randomly be attacked by Garo enemies who 
surround you in a ring of fire, but they are easy to defeat. 
 
   Walk straight ahead to the broken bridge, and freeze the Octoroks into 
blocks of ice that you can use to get to the platform. Use your hookshot on 
the tree on the ledge above, and continue hookshotting up to the top, where 
you will find an owl statue. Hit it and walk straight ahead but slightly to 
the left until you come to a ramp. Take it upwards to a dried out lake with a 
tunnel opening at the end. Go inside, and walk toward the middle of the 
pool of water to make a ghost appear. Play the Song of Storms to get the water 
flowing again, which causes the music room outside to start working again. 
Leave this cave, and try to enter the music room, only to find a little girl 
who locks you out. 
 
   She seems to be hiding something, so for now, walk up the ramps on the left 
side of the music room until she comes out and walks a long distance, then 
quickly run and enter the room before she can lock you out. Head down the 
stairs in her house which lead to the basement, and over to the closet, where 
a gibdo (mummy enemy) will pop out. This really isn't a gibdo, but a human 
who was cursed into being a gibdo. Don't attack him, but instead play the 
Song of Healing to cure him and receive the MASK OF GIBDO. Now, you can do the 
"Filling the Log Book" side quest, which is partially optional (just filling 
your log book up, you can do it later if you wish, it's listed in the Side 
Quests section when you need it) or you can continue with the game.

                                  Underworld 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Mirror Shield 
 
   You will need the following items before entering the Underworld, otherwise 
you won't be able to proceed through the underworld: 
 
Bottle of Milk (Get it from the two farmers over by milk road) 
5 Magic Beans (From the hole inside the maze in the Deku Palace) 
10 Deku Nuts (Kill Deku Babas near the Swamp) 
A Fish (Look near the swamp to catch one) 
10 Bombs (Found in bushes everywhere) 
1 Empty Bottle (See "Bottles" in the Item/Weapons section) 
 
   Head over to the left of the music room and go up the ramps to find a giant 
hole in the ground. Climb down the ladder on the side of the hole which leads 
down into the Underworld. Make sure you have your Gibdo Mask on, and talk to 
the Gibdo blocking the door on the right. He wants you to give him 5 magic 
beans in order for him to let you pass. Set them to a C-Button and fork them 
over to go into the next room. The next Gibdo in this room wants 10 Deku Nuts, 
so set them to a C-Button and give them to him to pass into the next room, with 
another Gibdo who wants 10 bombs. Give them to him and pass on into the next 
room. Walk past the blades toward the center of the room to make a Big Poe 
appear. Shoot him with 5 arrows to kill him, then collect his flame in your 
empty bottle. 
 
   Head back to the second room you came to (the one where you gave the gibdo 
10 deku nuts) and talk to the other gibdo here. He wants the fish, so give it 
to him and pass on to the next room. Run through and give the gibdo at the end 
the Big Poe flame to make him disappear, allowing you to go into the last room 
with a gibdo in it. Give him the milk and proceed to the final room, where you 
will find several un-lit torches. Light all four with fire arrows to make a 
chest appear with the MIRROR SHIELD inside. Save your game, then warp to Clock 
Town to buy a Powder Keg from the goron in the bomb shop. You'll be needing 
it for the upcoming area of the game. Play the Song of Soaring and warp to the 
owl statue in Ikana Canyon. Head over to the right, where the big door is, and 
to the left of it is a crack in the wall, where you can go through into the 
Ikana Ruins. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Ikana Ruins 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Put on your Gibdo Mask, then enter the ruins via the large crack. Once 
inside, you will find several dancing redeads (if you are wearing the Gibdo 
Mask.) Ignore them, as they won't harm you, and shoot the frozen eyeball switch 
to the left with a fire arrow to unlock the door straight ahead. Go through 
the door and put on the Deku Mask to transform into Deku Link. Hit the switch 
and run down the corridor as quickly as possible before the roof falls back 
down on you. Once you get to the other side, hit the switch to make the roof 
come down, then hit it again to make it rise again. Run over to the second 
Deku Launcher and burrow inside of it, then wait for the roof to come down 
again. As it comes down, launch up to push it back up, then launch over to 
the pillar with the switch on it. 
 
   As normal Link, stand on the switch to unlock the door, and go into the next 
room. As Deku Link again, launch over to the lone platform to the left (with a 
switch on it) and step on the switch as normal Link to unlock the door. Use the 
Lens of Truth to see the invisible platform and hop over to it. Stand on it 
and kill the two skulltullas on the ceiling with arrows, then jump across the 
remaining two platforms over to the door, and go through it. Right when you 
enter, quickly run past the two flaming skulls or they will make your sword 
inaccessible for a short period of time. Run up the stairs, through the 
corridor and out the door which takes you to the roof. Hop up onto the ledge, 
and run around to the center of the building, then hop down on the little 
ledge with a deku launcher on it. 
 
   Launch over to the pillar with the switch on it and step on it as normal 
Link to move a little block. Jump off the pillar and go through the large 
crack to enter the ruins again. Shoot a fire arrow at the other frozen eyeball 
switch here to unlock the door on the right. Go through it to fight the 
floormaster enemy, just stand under the light, and point your shield at it to 
make it divide into three parts. Do the same for each part, collect the 
rupees, then shine light on the sun block with your shield to move it out of 
the way. Go past the dancing redeads and through the door at the end of the 
corridor to fight Wizrobe again. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Wizrobe 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   He is a little tougher than the last two times you fought him. Now, instead 
of shooting ice, he shoots fire, and lots of it. When he appears on one of the 
transportation pads on the ground, go up to him and slash him with your sword 
before he shoots fire at you. If you wait too long, he'll shoot the fire and 
you'll be harmed. You can also freeze him with an Ice Arrow and hit him with 
your sword, but it may be more difficult. It is also possible to reflect his 
fire attacks back at him with the mirror shield, but you have to be very close 
to him to do so. Continue doing this until he clones himself to make it a 
little more difficult for you. Just keep hitting the real one a few more times 
and he will be defeated, unlocking the door as he leaves. 
 
   Walk through the door, and back onto the roof area. Run around the corner 
to find a large cracked circle on the ground. Transform into Goron Link and 
place the Powder Keg you bought earlier on the circle to blow it up, then 
hop down into the new hole which leads back to the entrances of the ruins, but 
now there is sunlight shining through the hole. Reflect the light onto the 
sun block (and the redeads for some extra rupees) to remove it, then go through 
the opening to fight a boss. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: King Yigorse & Company 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Songs: Elegy of Emptiness 
 
   This guy has two soldiers to help him do his dirty work. When the battle 
first begins, shoot fire arrows at the curtains on the windows to burn them 
off, letting the sunlight in, then begin fighting with the two soldiers. Hit 
them with your sword, and when they fall to the ground, reflect sunlight onto 
them with your Mirror Shield. Once they are both gone, the king will get up 
and fight you himself. He is a lot tougher than his soldiers, and has three 
basic attacks: His main attack is his leap attack with his sword, it isn't 
as dangerous as the other two, but it can do so heavy damage. He also has an 
attack where he decapitates himself, and sends his head to attack you while 
his body attacks from the ground. 
 
   His final attack is blowing his poisonous breath on you, which does quite 
a bit of damage to your health meter. The easiest way to defeat him is to 
just attack him with your sword until his guard is down, then stun him with 
the sunlight. Once you eventually knock him down to the ground, quickly shine 
sunlight on him with your shield to kill him off. You will then view a cinema 
of the two soldier ghosts arguing, then they disappear, followed by the King's 
ghost who teaches you the ELEGY OF EMPTINESS which allows Link to create 
a stationary clone of himself in any form. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Stone Tower 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Stone Tower is located just northeast of Ikana Canyon. Head over to the main 
part of Ikana Canyon, and to the right of the once dried out lake is a large 
entrance, go through it to be in Stone Tower: A large structure with falling 
rocks and lots of levels, with only three blocks to help you get to the top. 
Your goal here is to get to the tip-top of Stone Tower, where you will find the 
entrance to the fourth dungeon. Start off by jumping across the three blocks 
as normal Link, and step on the switch on the other side (all switches in 
Stone Tower are not permanent, so when you get off them, the blocks will move 
back to where they first were.) Stand on the switch and play the Elegy of 
Emptiness to clone yourself (as normal Link) then hookshot up to the next 
platform (using the hookshot post.) 
 
   Transform into Goron Link and step on the switch here, then clone yourself 
(as Goron Link) to keep the switch held down. Turn back into normal Link and 
hookshot up to the next level where you will find another switch. Step on it 
as Zora Link (you can't do it as Deku Link, because he's not big enough to 
keep the switch held down) and clone yourself on it. Transform back into normal 
Link, then jump across the three blocks again to get to the other side where 
you'll find three switches next to each other. These are the reset switches, 
and when stepped on, will make the three blocks reset to their original spots. 
Step on each one to reset the blocks, then hookshot up to the next platform. 
Step on the switch and clone yourself as normal Link, then hookshot up again. 
 
   Kill the Beamos enemy with a bomb, then stand on the switch as Goron Link, 
clone yourself, then hookshot up to the next platform as normal Link. Step on 
the switch as Zora Link, clone, then jump across the three blocks as normal 
Link again to the other side. Step on the three reset switches to reset the 
blocks, then hookshot up again to the next platform (watch out for the rocks 
while doing so) and hookshot up again, and finally up to the highest level, 
where you will find an owl statue. Hit it to remember your place, then stand 
on each of the three blocks in front of you as a different character then 
clone yourself. You must, however, do this in a certain order to get the blocks 
aligned properly, the correct order is: Right, Left, Center. Jump across the 
three blocks and go through the giant owl mouth to the Stone Tower Temple. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Stone Tower Temple (Reality) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Dungeon Map, Small Key (2), Compass, Fairy (15) 
 
   When you first enter the dungeon, kill off the two dragonflies and the bomb 
dog on the central platform, then shoot an arrow at the eyeball switch on the 
large statue (look up to find it) to make a fairy in a chest appear. Once 
finished in this room, go through the door on the left to find a room with 
three small switches, one large switch and bomb dogs. Kill the dogs first, then 
step on the first two small switches as normal Link and Zora Link. Make clones 
of each to keep the switches held down, then transform into Goron Link and step 
on the big switch to push it down. Clone yourself on it, then go back near the 
entrance of this room to find a cracked wall. Bomb it, then ram one of the 
large wooden crates to get it out of your way. 
 
   Pick up one of the small crates behind the large ones, and carry it to the 
last switch near the closed gate. Set it on the switch to make the gate open, 
then go through into the next area of the dungeon. Stock up on inventory by 
slashing the bushes here, then find the discolored square on the ground and 
place a bomb on it to reveal a hidden entrance. Jump down and use your hookshot 
on the treasure chest across the molten lava pit; open it to get the DUNGEON  
MAP, then transform into Goron Link and fire punch four statues in this room to 
kill them, then get the SMALL KEY from the treasure chest that appears. Go back 
up to the top, and use the key on the locked door. Transform into Zora Link 
and swim underwater until you reach a hand enemy. Let it grab you, and it will 
throw you up onto a platform with a treasure chest. 
 
   Open it to get another SMALL KEY, then swim under the hand this time, and 
into the next room. Climb up onto the strip in the middle of the room, and 
stand under the circle of light as normal Link. Reflect the light onto the 
mirror for at least 10 seconds (the light stays on the mirror for the same 
amount of time that you shine it on the mirror) then run over to the mirror 
and reflect the light onto the sun block to remove it. Watch out for the bomb 
dog and open the chest to get the COMPASS. Go back to the strip in the middle 
of the room, and go through the locked door at the other end. As Goron Link, 
fire punch the three parts of the pillar in the middle of the room, then kill 
the Black Boe enemies so they don't interfere with your next task. Once 
they are dead, quickly reflect the light onto the shield to the left for at  
least 15 seconds. 
 
   Run over to the mirror and shine light onto the next mirror until it runs 
out, then run over to _that_ mirror and reflect light onto the sun block, and 
go through the next door. As Deku Link, launch over to the air pipe, and go 
around to the left side, using the air pipes to your advantage, then land on 
the platform on the other side (this may take a few tries.) Go through the 
door here to fight a mini-boss. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Ghost of Garo 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Light Arrows 
 
   This is a larger form of the normal Garos that appeared in Ikana Canyon, 
and he attacks using his fire swords. Put on your Bunny Hood, and when he 
attacks you, move out of the way so he misses. Most of the time he will stand 
there for a few moments, allowing you to slash him with your sword. Otherwise, 
after he misses, he will disappear, then reappear right above you. Move out of 
the way and slash him again when he does this. After 4 or 5 hits, he will be 
dead, and a treasure chest will appear, containing the LIGHT ARROWS. Go through 
the open door, and hop up onto the little ledge, then jump across the to the 
platform. Z-Target the enemy in front of you, and throw a bomb at him, followed 
by a slash from the sword to kill him.  
 
   Go through the next door, and defeat the Eyegole by walking up to it to make 
it come to life, and attack, but as it attacks, run away real fast so it 
misses. Whenever it misses, its eye will turn yellow, allowing you to shoot 
an arrow into it. Four or five shots should be enough to kill him. Go through 
the open door, which leads back into the first room in the dungeon. Save your 
game if you want, then warp to the owl statue in Stone Tower (the one right 
in front of the Stone Tower Temple.) Step on the three switches, clone  
yourself on the again (Right, Left, Center) and jump across the three blocks 
to the dungeon entrance, only this time, shoot a Light Arrow at the red 
switch right in front of you to flip the world upside down. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Stone Tower Temple (Illusion) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Small Key (2) 
 
   Head back into the dungeon and go through the door on the right. You will 
notice the path is blocked by a huge sun block. Shoot a light arrow at it and 
it will disappear, allowing you to pass. As Deku Link, use the air pipes to 
launch up to a platform with an enemy similar to the one in the Woodfall 
Dungeon on it. Kill it, then go through the next area and step on the switch 
to make a treasure chest appear. Run back and open the chest to get a SMALL 
KEY. As Deku Link again, use the air pipes to launch up to the ceiling, where 
you will find a ledge with a locked door on it. Use your key on the door and 
go into the next room. Shoot a light arrow at the red switch across the room 
to turn the dungeon right side up. 
 
   Walk across the lava as Goron Link, then shoot the red switch again on the 
other side to turn it back upside down. Go through the door and shoot the next 
red switch across the room, then hop down and push the block you see toward 
the center of the room until it is aligned with the center. Shoot the red 
switch again, then push the block to the other side of the room. Shoot the 
switch again, but this time, push the block back against where the floor rises 
until it can go no further. Shoot the switch one last time, and push the block 
into the hole, then climb up to the ledge using the block, and go through the 
door to fight Wizrobe again. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Wizrobe 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Wizrobe is a bit more powerful than he was the last time you fought him, 
but there is an easy (yet long) way of defeating him. Run behind the gate you 
see in the corner of the room, and wait for him to appear on the transportation 
pad across from you, then shoot him with an arrow. He can't hurt you from 
any other pad but that one, and when he appears, you'll be there to shoot him. 
This will take a while because you have to wait for him to appear on that 
pad. After a few shots, he'll clone himself as usual. Just continue hitting 
him the way you have been until he is defeated and a treasure chest will appear 
on the ledge above you. 
 
   Use your hookshot on the chest, and go through the door at the top. Use the 
Deku Launcher as Deku Link to get to the other side of the room, and go through 
the door. Use your hookshot or arrows on the spikes across the way to make them 
explode, then launch over there as Deku Link and land on the little platform 
(watch out for the moving pots.) Hookshot up to the treasure chest (don't worry 
about the spike, it will explode in a cinema as you are going up) and go 
through this next door to fight another mini-boss. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Gomez 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Boss Key 
 
   Gomez is pretty tough because of his primary weapon: a scythe. He has a pack 
of bats that surround and protect him, and the only way to get rid of them 
is to shoot a light arrow at him to scatter them off. Once they aren't covering 
his body, give him a slash with your sword, then quickly run away using the 
Bunny Hood before he hits you with his scythe. You can get some extra magic 
by killing a few bats, and there are hearts in the four pots in each corner 
of the room. Continue shooting light arrows and slashing until he dies, then 
go through the next door, and open the chest to get the BOSS KEY. 
 
   Head back to the room just before the one with the explosive spikes, and 
launch up to the left corner right near you. Go through this little area until 
you find a switch on the ground. Step on it then run over to the treasure chest 
to pick up another SMALL KEY. Exit this little place and back into the room 
with the Poes. Go back through the door and into the room with the spikes, but 
turn right immediately after you go through the door to find another door; go 
through it to fight a tougher version of the Eyegole enemy you fought earlier 
in this dungeon. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MINI-BOSS: Eyegole 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Masks: Giant Mask 
 
   Run up to him to make him attack (if you don't run fast enough, he'll start 
shooting his eye laser at you, in which case, you can deflect the laser with 
your mirror shield) and then quickly back away to make his eye turn yellow. 
Make sure you are close to him when you shoot the arrow at his eye, otherwise 
the rocks that appear when he attacked will hit you and you won't have time 
to shoot him. Continue this method of attack until he's defeated, leaving a 
golden treasure chest behind. Open it to get the GIANT MASK which you will be 
using shortly to defeat the boss of this dungeon. Go through the open door 
(watch out for the spiked log) and hit the switch on the other side of the 
room to make a treasure chest on top appear. 
 
   Go over to where the spiked log is moving up and down and when the log goes 
down, hookshot up to the chest to land on top, then hookshot to the plate 
when the other spiked log is not in your way. Collect the rupees, then drop 
down to where the boss door is. Stock up on hearts/magic before entering (you 
may need some green magic potions, so I suggest warping/buying some if you 
can't beat him after a while.) Go through the door, have your Giant Mask 
set to a C-Button, then jump through the hole into a sandy, windy atmosphere. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Twin-Mold 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Items: Heart Container 
Masks: Twin-Mold Guardian Mask 
 
   Use the Giant Mask to transform into Giant Link and begin slashing at the 
tail/head of each mold (the flying dragons are called "molds.") This mask uses 
up tons of your magic, so make sure you slash and break the pillars to release 
magic jugs. Once you are out of magic, run over and pick up the jugs or use 
your green potion(s). It _is_ possible to attack the molds as normal Link, 
but it's not even worth it. You have to wait for the mold to rise from the 
ground, and slash it in the head/tail. This will never work because the molds 
will kill you before you kill them, so you must be Giant Link for this to work. 
Continue slashing their heads/tails until both are defeated (after about 6 hits 
they will each die.) 
 
   Collect the HEART CONTAINER and step on the glowing orb to get the TWIN-MOLD 
GUARDIAN MASK. View the cinema of Ikana (Ekhana) Valley turning back into 
normal; all the gibdos dying; all the redeads dying; Stone Tower turning back 
into normal; and everyone & everything is all peachy once again. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                      Stone Tower Temple Fairy Locations 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
1. Shoot the left eye switch when you first enter the temple to make a chest  
   appear with a fairy. 
 
2. In the room with the six sun crests, shine light onto one of them to  
   make a chest appear with a fairy. 
 
3. In the same room there is a sun crest/treasure chest behind the blue  
   block. Use the mirror shield to shine light onto it to make a chest with 
   a fairy appear. 
 
4. In the room with lava and a Deku Flower use the Deku Mask to launch to the 
   chest with the fairy in it. 
 
5. In the same room as #4 use the Goron Mask to hit the floor switch and then 
   quickly roll around the bend to the next switch that will reveal a chest 
   with the fairy. 
 
6. Defeat Hiploop and drop off the right side of the path to the lower ledge. 
   Find the Crystal Switch below a grate and use a bomb to trigger it. Same as 
   above with chest and fairy. 
 
7. Kill the Eyegole and open the chest. 
 
8. Use the Dexihand to get back on dry land and set a bomb near the fenced in  
   Crystal Switch. When activated use the Zora Form to swim to the other pool  
   and melt the sun stone and kill the beamos. Same as above, chest/fairy. 
 
9. In the basement look up and you will see a hookshot point near the stairs,  
   between two statues. Dungeon right side up and collected when flipped 
   upside-down. 
 
10. Dive under the water and clear the spikes then step on the gold switch.  
    Flip the temple use one of your clones to hold down the blue switch and 
    deactivate the fire. Then use the Deku Mask to fly to the chest. Chest 
    Opened while dungeon is flipped. 
 
11. Shoot the suns while temple is flipped to get fairy #11. 
 
12. Shoot the sun in room 12 with all the trenches. The chest appears in the  
    hallway. 
 
13. Kill Wizrobe. Chest appears when dungeon is flipped and opened when right 
    side up. 
 
14. In the room with an armos guard use the Zora Mask to get up to the 
    platform. Wear the Stone Mask so that the Armos can't see you and flip the 
    statue with a Light Arrow. Then remove the Stone mask so that the Armos 
    will see you and fall to the ground. Then turn things right side up and 
    grab the chest that the Armos was guarding. 
 
15. In the Basement, use the Zora mask to get the chest in the room with a lot  
    of water. You have to turn the dungeon right-side up first though.

                                   The Moon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Masks: Fierce Deity Mask 
Heart Pieces: 4 
 
   Before performing this next section, you will need all 20 normal masks for  
the upcoming quest. If not, refer to the "Filling the Log Book" section in the 
"Side Quests" part of this guide to get them. I recommend collecting at least 
3 fairies in bottles, and one magic potion. Make sure you have a full stock of 
arrows, bombs, etc. and you should have at least 12-14 hearts on your meter if 
you actually plan on winning. On Day 3 at 12:00 AM, the Clock Tower will open 
up, allowing you to go inside once again. Launch up there using the nearby 
Deku Launcher, and go up the stairs to find Skull Kid. Watch the cinema, then 
play the Ode to Order (C-Right, C-Down, A, C-Down, C-Right, C-Up) and you 
will view a cinema of Majora's Mask being removed from Skull Kid and being 
sucked up onto the moon. 
 
   The Guardians can't hold the moon up any longer, so Link decides to warp to 
the moon also. You will be taken to a grassy field with a tree in the center, 
with four kids running around the tree, each wearing one of the four guardian 
masks. Then you will find the last kid, who is wearing Majora's Mask, sitting 
against the tree; talking to him will take you to the final battle, but first, 
you should collect two new masks, one of which will help you with the final 
battle. You must, however, have all 20 normal masks to do this next part. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                Odolwa Dungeon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Talk to the first kid (the one wearing Odolwa's Mask) and he will ask for 
one mask to enter the Odolwa Dungeon. Set any of your normal masks to one of 
the C-Buttons, and give it to him to be warped to the Odolwa Dungeon. 
Transform into Deku Link, and launch yourself to the first set of spinning 
launchers, then from that spinning launcher, launch to the next, and as soon 
as you land on the launcher, burrow inside to avoid being hit with the spiked 
rod that is spinning also. From here, you can either launch to the left or 
right platform. I suggest going to the right first, and collecting the HEART  
PIECE, then dying and doing it again, but go to the left this time and give 
the kid one mask to be warped back to the field. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Goht Dungeon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Find the kid wearing the Ghot mask this time, and he will ask for two normal 
masks to enter the dungeon. Give him any two of your normal masks to be warped 
to the Goht Dungeon. Transform into Goron Link, and go up a bit to find a strip 
that you can roll on. Do a spiked roll straight down the middle, and when you 
jump off the ramp, let go of the control stick, but continuing holding the A 
button. If you went straight down the middle, you will hit the chests, and 
automatically roll over the next gap and hit the next chests, then roll over 
a series of gaps, hit a final set of chests, and once you reach the magic pots, 
stop rolling. Go up the bridge, and roll over the next gap, then walk past the 
three magic pots and roll across the next set of gaps to find the HEART PIECE, 
then search around the rest of this area to find the kid. Give him two masks 
to exit back to the field. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Gyorg Dungeon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Find the kid wearing Gyorg's mask, and give him three normal masks to enter 
the Gyorg dungeon. This one is pretty easy; as Zora Link, dive down to start 
moving through underwater tunnels. There are three different ending paths you 
can arrive at: one with a gossip stone, one with the kid, and one with a heart 
piece. Go left, left, right, left to reach the HEART PIECE (then you can go 
back) and go left, left, right, right to reach the kid, which asks for three 
masks to exit the dungeon and back into the field. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               Twin-Mold Dungeon 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   You will be fighting a series of mini-bosses in this dungeon. Go through 
the first door to fight the lizard, kill him to open the next door, go through 
that to fight a Garo (you may lose some health in this battle), once he's 
dead go through the next door to fight an Iron Knuckle. Kill it like you did 
before to get some bombchus. Bomb the crack to go into the next room, then 
bomb the crack on the ceiling by shooting an arrow at a bombchu when it's right 
over the crack on the ceiling; shoot the eyeball switch, etc. until you find 
the kid or the HEART PIECE. Once you find the kid, give him your final four 
normal masks to exit this dungeon. Talk to the kid sitting against the tree 
(the one wearing Majora's Mask) and say yes to him to the FIERCE DEITY MASK, 
which is currently temporary until you beat the final boss. Say yes to him 
again to warp the final boss' lair. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Final Battle: Majora's Mask 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The Guardian Masks will then leave your possession and go to their portals, 
causing Majora's Mask to come from the center portal and engage battle with  
you. Majora's Mask has three different phases, all different difficulties. It 
also depends on which character you fight the mask as, for instance, if you 
fight it as normal Link, the battle is going to be much tougher than when you 
fight him as Fierce Deity Link. Below is the strategy for the final battle 
combined with strategy as normal Link and as Fierce Deity Link. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Majora's Mask (Phase 1) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   The only way to attack the mask in this form is to hit it from behind. No 
matter what you use, you won't be able to do _any_ damage by hitting it on the 
front. Wait for it to start spinning on the ground, then do a spinning slash 
to knock it down to the ground, followed by a quick slash on the back before 
it gets back up. Alternatively, you can wait for it to dive down at you, then 
run out of the way while wearing the Bunny Hood, then shoot an arrow at it 
from behind. After you hit it about 3 times in either of these manners, the 
four guardian masks will come from their portals and begin attacking you with 
light orbs. Shoot about 3 arrows at each to kill them, while at the same time 
keeping an eye on Majora's Mask so he doesn't pull any sneaky tricks. Once the 
masks are gone, the mask will constantly use its fire beam attack. Just keep 
avoiding it until he starts spinning again so you can slash him. Soon enough 
he will be dead, but he then re-incarnates himself. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Majora's Mask (Phase 2) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Stand in one place and wait for the mask to come near you, when it's within 
range of your sword, slash it to make it stop moving, then continue to slash 
it with the Gilded Sword (or whatever sword you have) until it spins away 
again. If it doesn't come near you, or you just don't feel like waiting for it 
to come near you, use a light arrow on it to make it fall, then run up and 
slash it with your sword. This is the easiest form of the mask, and it 
shouldn't take very long to kill. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BOSS: Majora's Mask (Phase 3) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Obviously, this is the hardest form of Majora's Mask. He will use his 
newly grown tentacles to whip at you, and it's almost impossible to avoid his 
attacks. Stay in one part of the room (facing the mask) and wait for him to 
whip you, then fire an arrow at him right before he whips you. Try using your 
other forms of Link to stun him then hit him with any light arrows you have 
left. When he begins to dodge your attacks, just try to stun him with any form 
of link then run up and hit him with your sword or any remaining items that 
can do damage. He will soon be defeated and you can view the ending of the game 
in peace. To defeat all three forms as Fierce Deity Link, just use the same 
methods, only it will be much easier as FDL because he has a more powerful 
sword than normal Link. 
 
 
=============================================================================== 
                      VII.  SIDE QUESTS / MISCELLANEOUS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   There are some parts of the game that really don't belong in the 
walkthrough section of this FAQs. Hence, I've created a new section for them. 
Below are some mini side-quests that you can optionally choose to complete 
in the game but don't necessarily have to. You will also find some odds and 
ends such as certain listings. 
 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
                           Getting The Gilded Sword 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   There are 4 different swords in the game: Kokiri Sword (the one you start 
out with), Razor Sword (the one you can upgrade to, but it's not permanent), 
the Gilded Sword (the permanent sword), and the Big Fairy Sword (strongest 
sword in the game.) You start out the game equipped with the Kokiri Sword, and 
from there you can upgrade to the Razor sword, but when you go back in time, 
you lose the Razor Sword, therefore you must get the Gilded Sword. How do you 
get it, you ask? Once you defeat Goht (the Snowhead Temple boss) play the Song 
of Time Reversion, then go back to the main area of Goron Shrine (where the 
wooden cabin is.) Make sure you have the Adult Wallet and currently have 100 
rupees in your inventory, then go into the cabin and talk to the blacksmith. 
 
   He will agree to upgrade your Kokiri Sword into the Razor Sword if you 
pay him 100 rupees. While he is upgrading, if you haven't yet gotten the Gold 
Dust and the empty bottle for placing first in the Goron Races, go and do that 
(see the proper section in the Walkthrough on how to access the Goron Races) 
then once you have the Gold Dust, warp to day 2 by playing the Song of Time 
Compression and go pick up your new Razor Sword. After you pick it up, give 
the Gold Dust to the blacksmith, and play the Song of Time Compression once 
again to warp to Day 3, then visit the Blacksmith one last time to get the 
Gilded Sword, and save your game right after you get it.

                            Anju And Kafei (Notebook) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
   Believe it or not, there actually is a story behind the log book, and a 
major thanks goes out to Kyle Shi who explained it very well in his FAQ, 
allowing me to describe it to you. There was once a man named "Kafei" who 
was deeply in love with a woman named "Anju" and they eventually became 
engaged to be married. You see, Anju possessed the "Moon Mask" which, when 
combined with the Sun Mask would create the "Mask of the Wedded Couple" so 
Kafei was bound and determined to gain the Sun Mask, no matter what he had 
to do. The day before their wedding ceremony, Kafei stole the Sun Mask from 
the Happy Mask Man, which was a big no-no. 
 
   Once the Happy Mask Man found out about Kafei's naughty sin, he put a curse 
on him which turned him into a little boy. Kafei, not able to live up to his 
shame, lived out the rest of his life hiding in a Keaton Mask, hidden away in 
his home at Clock Town. Anju went back to work as a clerk at the Inn, and 
still wonders about Kafei. Where he is, what happened to him...That's where 
the log book (notebook) comes into play. You must talk to several people and 
do several tasks and record them all into your log book each day. If you do 
not do the below, your game ending will change. This section of the log book 
is mandatory, but the other sections are optional. (Thanks to The 64 Chimp for 
explaining this to me.) 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                    Day #1 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
10:00 AM - 12:00 PM 
Make your way to the Mayor's Office (next door to the bomber kid blocking the 
path to the observatory) and go into the room on the right to find a man, 
a woman, and a fat zora. Talk to them all to receive the Mask of Kafei. 
 
2:00 PM - 2:15 PM 
Go to the Inn on the right side of town, and wait for the postman to come 
through the door and talk to Anju. After he leaves, talk to Anju as normal 
Link to get the Room Key. 
 
2:30 PM - 3:00 PM 
Talk to Anju in the Inn (right side of clock town) wearing the Mask of Kafei 
and say yes to her challenge. 
 
12:00 AM 
Go to the Inn on the right side of town, and on the first floor, make your 
way to the last door on the right side until Anju comes and stops walking. 
Talk to her to get a piece of mail for Kafei. 
 
12:15 AM - 6:00 AM 
Set the mail for Kafei to one of your C-Buttons, then go outside and find 
any mailbox. Press A then press the C-Button which holds the mail for Kafei 
to put it in the mailbox for the postman to collect the next day. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                    Day #2 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
3:00 PM 
Go to Kafei's house (near the laundry pool) and wait for the postman to come 
and deliver Kafei's mail. While Kafei is getting it, go inside his house and 
wait for him to return. Talk to him and he will show his true face and give 
you a pendant for Anju and tells you to deliver it. 
 
4:00 PM - 8:30 PM 
Go back to the Inn (right side of town) and give the Pendant from Kafei to 
her. That's all for the second day. Warp to Day three or just wait. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                    Day #3 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
1:00 PM - 6:00 PM 
Make your way back to Kafei's House, and go inside to find the Night Shop 
cashier inside. Talk to him to get the Keaton Mask as well as the Express 
Mail, which can be used in two ways (do one, then go back in time to do 
the other): 
 
a.) At 6:00 PM on day 3, go to the milk bar on the right side of town 
    and talk to the fat lady when wearing the Mask of Kafei, then give her 
    the Express Mail to get a bottle filled with Chateau Romani. 
 
b.) On the final day, take the Express Mail over to the Postman's house at 
    6:00 PM (play the Inverted Song of Time to slow down time first.) Give him 
    the Express Mail, and he will go deliver it to Kafei's Mother in the milk 
    bar for you. Once he delivers it and goes back outside, wait for him to 
    stop, and talk to him to get the Postman's Hat. 
 
 
6:00 PM - 7:00 PM 
Head to Ikana Canyon, and make your way to where the broken bridge and Octoroks 
are located. From here, head right and follow the ledge into the next area to 
find Kafei. Wait with him until the Sakon opens the door. You will now play 
a timed puzzle, where you have to control between Link and Kafei, stepping on 
the blue switches and killing the enemies as you go until you reach the Sun's 
Mask. Collect it and go back to see Anju in the Inn at Clock Town to get the 
Couple's Mask.

                            Owl Statue Locations 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
Clock Town: The statue here is located on the ramps near the clock tower. It 
is the first statue you will find in the game, and it's directly in front of 
the area leading to the left side of town. Hit it with your sword to remember 
your spot in the game. 
 
Milk Road: Take the south exit of Clock Town and veer to the right a little to 
start walking along Milk Road. Once you are on the next screen, you will find 
the owl statue next to three bushes. Hit it with your sword to easily warp 
back to Milk Road whenever needed. 
 
The Swamp: When entering from Termina field, look to the right edge of the 
where the Tourist swamp is located and you'll find this useful owl statue. 
Many people miss this one on the way in, so look out for it, because you'll 
be using it quite frequently. 
 
Woodfall Temple: On the central platform in the room where the woodfall temple 
entrance is revealed is the owl statue. Hit it so you can easily warp back to 
the entrance of this temple whenever needed. 
 
Mountain Village: Once you enter the Mountain Village, head to the northwest 
area (near the goron on a platform) and you will find the owl statue next to 
a few snowballs you can chop up. 
 
Snowhead Dungeon: From the main entrance to Mountain Village (where the log 
cabin is) go northwest through to the next area. Roll over the gaps as Goron 
Link, and go onto the next screen, with the goron blowing his breath at you. 
The owl statue is against the wall, hit it with your sword. 
 
Great Bay: Using Epona, hop over the fences near the beach area to get into 
the Great Bay. Once here, get the Zora Mask by pushing the Zora back to land 
and playing the Song of Healing for him. With the Zora Mask, swim out to the 
platform in the water and hit the owl statue when you get to it. 
 
Zora Cape: In the 2nd area of Great Bay, swim out to the statue you see in 
the distance, then sink down to the ocean floor as Zora Link, kill the Like 
Like and go through into Zora Hall. Near the back, where Lulu is 
standing, you will find the owl statue. 
 
Ikana Canyon: After going to the Mountain Terrain area, use the Garo Mask to 
talk to the Garo up on the cliff. Hookshot up to the tree then go through 
the rocks. Use the trees up ahead to get up to Ikana Canyon where you will 
find the owl statue. 
 
Stone Tower: At the tip top of Stone Tower you will find the owl statue in 
front of three switches, which you can hit to make the blocks rise (right 
across from the entrance to the Stone Tower Temple.) 
 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
                                   THE SHOPS 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
 
CURIOSITY SHOP 
   This shop is located on the left side of town and only opens at 10:00 PM on 
any day. The man behind the counter will buy any random items or inventory 
you may have to sell. This is useful to gain some extra rupees if you don't 
feel like chopping up bushes all day. 
 
 
THE BANK 
   On the next side of town, you will notice a beggar type man sitting on a 
little platform; this is the bank owner. You can deposit and withdraw rupees 
from him at any point during the game, and if you go back in time, your rupees 
in the bank will remain in-tact, versus having them in your wallet when you go 
back in time. To get new wallets, you must have at least the maximum amount of 
money the new wallet can carry inside the bank, or you can't get it. 
 
 
BOMB SHOP 
   Also on the left side of town, this shop stocks nothing but bombs and items 
dealing with bombs. You can purchase items such as bomb bags, bombs, bombchus, 
Powder Kegs, etc. Below is a price listing of this shop so you'll have a rough 
idea of how much things cost when shopping here. Please note that to buy a 
Powder Keg, you can only do so by talking to the goron here as Goron Link, and 
in order to buy bombs, you must first buy a bomb bag. 
 
10 Bombchus     = 30 Rupees 
1 Powder Keg    = 50 Rupees 
10 Normal Bombs = 30 Rupees 
 
 
GORON SHRINE SHOP 
   You will also find a shop (similar to the shop in clock town) in Goron 
Shrine (where the crying baby is.) You can buy some arrows, or other random 
items from this shop, so be sure to check it out if you are short on inventory 
and don't feel like warping back to Clock Town for the nearest shop. 
 
 
TRADING POST 
   The Trading Post is located on the left side of Clock Town, and you can buy 
several useful items from them. Below is a list of all the items and their 
prices (the banker is located just across from the trading post if you need 
some extra money.) 
 
Arrows (30)       = 30 Rupees 
Arrows (50)       = 40 Rupees 
Deku Stick (1)    = 10 Rupees 
Deku Nuts (10)    = 30 Rupees

   Once you get the Keaton Mask, try hitting the circle of bushes in clock town 
(near the park) to make them come alive and start moving. Put the Keaton Mask 
on when this happens to talk to Keaton. He will ask you a series of questions 
dealing with the game, and if you answer them all correctly, you will be 
rewarded with a heart piece. Major thanks to Devin Morgan for both the

                             VIII.  ITEMS/WEAPONS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   As you may or may not know, there are tons of items in Zelda: Majora's Mask. 
Ranging from arrows, to bottles, to swords, to almost anything imaginable. 
Below is an alphabetical list of each item, along with where you can find/buy 
it, it's price (if bought) or how to get it (if found), plus a little 
description of each one. Along with items, I've also done the same thing with 
weapons, such as swords, bows, etc. For information on how to get the best 
sword, see the "Side Quests" section. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: 200 Rupees 
 
How to get it: When you first start out, you can only carry a total of 99 
rupees. Collect a bunch, then deposit them into your bank account. Continue 
to do this until you get 200 rupees into the bank, that you'll receive the 
Adult Wallet. 
 
Description: With this handy item, your maximum rupee amount increases from 
99 to 200. Once you get 200 rupees, you cannot collect anymore. Try to get 
this early on in the game, so you can purchase useful items later on.

                                    Arrows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: After you face off against the Gekko Mini-Boss, and defeat him, 
a treasure chest will magically appear, containing the Hero's Bow along with 30 
arrows. From there on, you can find standard arrows in pots, in bushes, and 
sometimes in snowballs. 
 
Description: These are used with your Hero's Bow, and provide a good aim shot 
at any enemy or item you want to shoot at. These do the same amount of damage 
as the Kokiri sword, and are used often throughout the game. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

account, then go into the bomb shop in the left area of Clock Town. You can 
buy a Bomb Bag for 40 rupees from the owner. 
 
Description: You _must_ have a Bomb Bag before you can purchase/collect bombs. 
When you first buy it, it comes equipped with 20 bombs, and after buy it, you 
can collect bombs from bushes, pots, snowballs, etc. or purchase them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Clock Town 
 
Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: Unknown 
 
How to get it: These can be purchased from the Bomb Shop on the left side of 
Clock Town, and can also be found in other bomb shops around Termina. Sometimes 
you can find them in rocks or other destructible items, but you will most 
often be purchasing them. 
 
Description: When you place these on the ground, they will move forward and 
explode when they come in contact with something. They can move onto any 
surface (walls, ceilings, etc.) and only explode when they hit something. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location: Clock Town 
 
Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: 40 rupees 
 
How to get it: Bombs are located all over Termina, in the overworld, in 
dungeons, towns, etc. You can find them inside of pots, underneath bushes, or 
sometimes inside rocks or snowballs (or even after defeating an enemy.) You 
can also buy them for random prices in different bomb shops. You get your 
first set of 20 bombs after you buy the Bomb Bag for 40 rupees in Clock Town. 
 
Description: These have the same amount of power/strength as one slice from 
the Kokiri sword, and do tasks that the sword can't. You can defeat enemies, 
blow up rocks/snowballs, or get rid of cracked walls with these. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               Bomber's Notebook 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Clock Town 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: After playing the hide n' seek game with the bomber kids, use 
the password to go through to the observatory as normal Link, then come back 
out and the kid blocking the entrance will give you this notebook. 
 
Description: This book keeps an extensive log of the characters you talk to, 
the challenges you are faced with, and the masks you collect throughout the 
game. It's up to you whether or not you wish to fill it, but you must at least 
fill the Anju and Kafei part (See "Side Quests" section) if you don't want 
the game ending to change. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   Boss Keys 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Dungeons 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: After defeating a mini-boss in each dungeon, a treasure chest 
will appear carrying this key. 
 
Description: Each dungeon has one of these keys, and without them, you will 
not be able to unlock the door leading to the dungeon boss' lair. Normally 
you get these keys by defeating mini-bosses in the dungeon. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                    Bottles 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Description: You can carry tons of items/liquids inside empty bottles, such as: 
Milk, Fish, Water, Potions, Gold Dust, Hot Water, etc. Very useful and required 
to proceed through some areas of the game. 
 
Locations: There are a total of 6 empty bottles you can collect in the game, 
below are their locations and how to get them. 
 
1.) After defeating Skull Kid in Clock Town, go to the swamp area, and walk 
    through the forest behind the witch's hut until you find Kotake, who is 
    hurt. Go back to the witch's hut and talk to Koume to receive the bottle 
    with some red potion inside. 
 
2.) Once you defeat Goht (Snowhead Temple boss) get a Powder Keg from the 
    giant Goron, and blow up the rock in the area with the bridges. This gives 
    you access to the Goron Races. Place 1st to get the 2nd bottle which has 
    some Gold Dust inside. 
 
3.) At Romani Ranch, on the first night (at 2:00 AM), follow Romani into the 
    barn, then go back outside and wait for the UFOs to appear. They will come 
    from all sides of the barn, and your job is to kill them with arrows, 
    making sure none of them get to the barn. If you do this until 5:30 AM, 
    you will gain the bottle along with some normal milk already inside. 
 
4.) In the second area of Great Bay, hookshot up all the palm trees on each 
    platform until you get to a cave entrance. Go into the water as Zora Link 
    and talk to the beaver to challenge him to a race through 20 rings in 2 
    minutes. After you win, you must defeat his brother through 25 rings in 
    the same amount of time. Once you win again, you will get the bottle. 
    Repeat this to get another heart piece. 
 
5.) Visit the Ekhana Graveyard at night on Day Three and get the skeletons  
    to smash the grave they're dancing round. Drop down into the hole and run 
    through to meet Dampe the Gravedigger. Talk to him and he'll follow you 
    around the room - he walks very slowly though, so you'll have to take your 
    time. Lead him over the dirt mounds and he'll dig; in three of them are  
    Poe flames. There's always one on the ground level, but the others are 
    usually on the upper floor. To get him there, lead Dampe over the yellow 
    squares in the floor and then run upstairs after him... if he's on the 
    left-hand square, run up the ladder behind you and if he's on the 
    right-hand square, climb up the blocks on the right. When all three flames 
    are revealed, a Giant Poe will appear. Kill it and you'll reveal a chest 
    with a bottle inside. (Thanks to The 64 Chimp) 
 
6.) Refer to the "Anju and Kafei (Log Book)" part in the "Side Quests" 
    section of this FAQ to find out how to get the Express Mail. Once you have 
    it, take it to Kafei's mother who is in the Milk Bar at 6:00 PM on the 
    3rd day. Give it to her and in return, she will reward you with the bottle. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                     Bugs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Underground caves 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: You must have an empty bottle to catch these bugs. When they 
appear from under a bush or rock (or if they are just out in the open) just use 
your bottle to capture one. 
 
Description: These are used to plant transportation leafs. Release the bug from 
your bottle onto a dirt patch, and when it rains, a transportation leaf will 
grow in on the patch. Pretty much an alternative to Magic Beans. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Chateau Romani 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Milk Bar 
Found/Bought: Both 
 
Price: (200 rupees if bought at store) 
 
How to get it: See the "Anju & Kafei" side quest in the "Side Quests" section 
and when you give Madame Aroma the Express Mail, she'll give you a bottle 
with Chateau Romani inside. You can also buy this at the Milk Bar for 200 
rupees. 
 
Description: This is a special type of milk, that when drank, will allow you 
to have an infinite amount of magic on your meter for a limited time. Buy it 
at the store for a whopping 200 rupees if you can afford it. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Child's Wallet 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Default Wallet

carry up to a maximum of 99 rupees, and not a rupee more. To upgrade to a 
different wallet, see the "Adult Wallet" or the "Giant Wallet" in this section 
to find out how to get each. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Dungeon Fairy 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Dungeons 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: There are a total of 15 dungeon fairies in each dungeon. You can 
find them inside pots, enemies, treasure chests, bubbles, and pretty much 
anything else. If you cannot reach a fairy, use the Great Fairy Mask to attract 
it towards you and collect it. 
 
Description: These fairies come in different colors, some are blue and others 
are yellow, but either way, if you collect all 15 of them and return them to 
the nearby fairy fountain, you will be rewarded by the Great Fairy for it. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                     Fairy 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Random Places 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A

find them hidden in pots, but occasionally, they are inside bushes, and even 
treasure chests at times. They are found in dungeons, in the overworld, and in 
towns all over Termina. 
 
Description: If you wish, you can capture one of these fairies in a bottle, and 
when you die (no more hearts on your meter) the fairy will automatically revive 
you (useful when battling tough bosses.) Or you can just walk into one and let 
it replenish 5 of your hearts. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   Hero's Bow 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Woodfall Temple 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: After you defeat the Dinalfos mini-boss in the Woodfall Temple, 
a treasure chest will appear holding the Hero's Bow along with 30 arrows 
already equipped. 
 
Description: One shot from the bow does the same amount of damage as one slice 
from the Kokiri Sword, but the difference between the two is that the Fairy 
Bow can hit certain objects that the sword can't. This item will be used 
very frequently throughout the game. Used to hit switches, defeat enemies, etc. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Hero's Shield 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Default Shield 
 
Found/Bought: N/A 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: This is your default shield, meaning when you start a new game, 
this is the shield you come equipped with. You don't have to find it nor buy 
it, you just have it. 
 
Description: This shield is very similar to the Hyrulian Shield in Zelda: OoT. 
It is made of metal, and can deflect normal attacks or rocks, etc. To use it, 
press the R button and you will be protected from basic attacks. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to get it: After you defeat the first phase on Wizrobe in the Snowhead 
Dungeon, the fire arrows will appear in a treasure chest. Fire Arrows cannot 
be found or bought, but normal arrows _can_ be transformed into fire arrows. 
 
Description: One shot from a fire arrow will do about 2x the damage the Kokiri 
sword does (1 slice.) The fire arrows are mostly used to melt large blocks of 
ice, or get rid of frozen forms. They do use magic when shot, so only use them 
when necessary. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

set to when you are right over the fish and Link will capture it in his bottle.

rupees. Other than that, I've yet to find a useful purpose for them.

House #2" part of the walkthrough.

Location: Stores

his meter. Useful if there are no bushes around to collect bottles of potion.

Location: Gerudo Lagoon 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A

corner, jump down, and open the chest to get the hookshot. 
 
Description: This handy tool is used for 2 purposes: To launch Link over to 
wooden items (if you aim this at a wooden barrel or box, you will be taken 
to it automatically) and to bring things to Link (pointing it at a certain 
items will draw them to you.) Very useful tool, you'll be using it often 
throughout the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   Hot Water 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Springs 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: In Goron Shrine, once you get the Goron Mask, pull the tomb- 
stone back to reveal a hidden spring where hot water will fill the room. You 
can also find it in other underground areas. Use an empty bottle to get some. 
 
Description: This will melt any ice block you can find, but the only problem 
is that it loses it's warmth after a while and turns into normal water, so if 
you plan on using it, you better be quick. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

equipped with, the same one he found in Ocarina of Time, naturally.

halfway through you can upgrade to the Gilded Sword. This will defeat most 
standard enemies, and you can do a charged slice once you get your magic meter. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Gilded Sword 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Goron Shrine 
 
Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: 100 Rupees, Gold Dust

3 and come back to get the Gilded Sword. 
 
Description: This sword is permanent (unlike the Razor Sword) and it's the 
3rd strongest sword in the game. It can do about 3 times the damage one slash 
from the Kokiri Sword can, great for battles. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Lens Of Truth 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Goron Shrine

blow up the rocks around the chest and use it to see the hidden treasures. 
 
Description: A returning item from Ocarina of Time, the Lens of Truth lets you 
see things you normally wouldn't see with the normal eye. Some people are 
invisible and can only be seen with this gadget. There are a few hidden ladders 
and treasure chests that can only be seen with this. It uses magic, but there 
is a trick to using it without wasting any magic at all. Just rapidly press 
the C-Button you have it set to and you can use it without wasting any magic 
at all. Useful if you need to use it for a long period of time. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Random Places 
 
Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: 20 rupees 
 
How to get it: There is a fat blue man who eats these beans, and will sell you 
a pod of them for 20 rupees (prices may vary in different areas.) 
 
Description: Plant these into a dirt patch anywhere in Termina, to sprout a 
flower. Then use water to water it, or wait until Day 2 when it rains to make 
the flower grow into a transportation leaf (the sound it makes is similar to 
those Halloween toys.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                    Ocarina 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Clock Town 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: On the third day at 12:00 AM, the clock tower will open allowing 
you to get to the roof, where you can then fight skull kid. Shoot a bubble at 
him to make him drop your Ocarina, then pick it up. 
 
Description: The last Zelda game was totally based on the Ocarina game (hence 
the title) and it is used to play several songs which perform different 
actions in the game (see the "Songs" section for what each song does.) The 
Ocarina now has 4 different forms: Normal Form (your standard blue Ocarina), 
Deku Pipes (as Deku Link), Drum form (as Goron Link), and Guitar form (as Zora 
Link) so you have lots of variety. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Pictograph Box 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: The Swamp 
 
Found/Bought: Found 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: Go to the second part of the swamp (where Koume's hut is) and 
make your way through the forest in the back of Koume's hut (the monkey will 
help you if you get lost.) You will find Kotake who is in need of potion, so 
get a free bottle of potion from Koume in her hut, then take it back to Kotake, 
who will fly off. Go back to the first area of the swamp and into the Photo 
Hut, where Kotake will be in the little square. Talk to her to get the 
Pictograph Box.

100 rupees per bomb, or 50 rupees to the Goron in Clock Town for one bomb.

size. They do 5 times more damage than a normal bomb and are useful to blow 
up large boulders or other items blocking your path.

                                    Quiver 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Default Quiver 
 
Found/Bought: N/A 
 
Price: N/A 
 
How to get it: Once you receive the Hero's Bow in the Woodfall Temple, you will 
also receive this quiver, This is the default quiver, meaning you don't have 
to purchase it. 
 
Description: This quiver is the lowest class one you can get, but it does hold 
a substantial amount of arrows (30 maximum.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                  Razor Sword 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Location: Goron Shrine 
 
Found/Bought: Bought 
 
Price: 100 Rupees 
 
How to get it: Once you defeat Goht for the first time, go to the blacksmith in 
the cabin and pay him 100 rupees to upgrade your sword. Warp to Day 2 to pick 
it up from him. 
 
Description: This sword is temporary, and isn't the strongest you can get. When 
you warp back to the first day, the sword will disappear, meaning you just blew 
100 rupees. You can upgrade to the Gilded Sword after you get this one, see the 
"Side Quests" section for more.

                                  Red Potion

Found/Bought: Bought

How to get it: Go to the 2nd area of the Swamp (where the entrance to the Lost 
Woods is located) and climb the ladder up to the witch's hut. You can purchase 
some red potion for 20 rupees if you have a bottle. 
 
Description: When used, this potion will regain 3-6 hearts on your health 
meter. Useful for tough battles, but bottled fairies are much more cost 
efficient, and replenish all health, so I suggest buying these only when needed 
for certain tasks in the game.

defeating a dungeon mini-boss, but normally just out in the open. 
 
Description: One small key will open one locked dungeon door. You can see how 
many small keys you have collected right above your rupee count in the bottom 
left corner of the screen. These are totally different than Boss Keys, as 
they open locked doors, not boss doors.

                                  IX.  SONGS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   You have 2 types of songs: Songs you learn, and hidden songs. The songs you 
learn are songs like the "Song of Time" or the "Goron's Lullaby," you learn 
them from different people or things while playing. The hidden songs are ones 
you never learn, but already know when you first start the game. They don't 
appear in your game menu, and you don't learn them anywhere in the game. How 
are you supposed to know what they are? That's what this section is for! Below 
are the descriptions of each song, along with where and who/what you learn them 
from. First are the learned songs, below those are the hidden songs. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Learned Songs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Name:         Song of Time 
How to play:  C-Right, A, C-Down, C-Right, A, C-Down 
Location:     Learned in Clock Town after defeating Skull Kid 
Description:  A returning song from Ocarina of Time, whenever Link plays the 
              Song of Time, it will warp him back to Day 1. In the JP version 
              of the game, it will also save your game. If you are low on time, 
              play this song to return to Day 1, however, whenever you play it, 
              you will be brought back to Clock Town again. As Link learns this 
              song he remembers back to when Saria first gave him his Ocarina 
              in Zelda: Ocarina of Time. 
 
Name:         Song of Healing 
How to play:  C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down 
Location:     Learned in Clock Town from the Happy Mask Man 
Description:  When played, the Song of Healing will remove a curse by a mask 
              on anyone or anything. Play this song to certain people to gain 
              certain masks. For instance, when you first play it, the Deku 
              Mask will come off of Link and will be added to your inventory. 
              If somebody is cursed by a mask, just play this song to cure 
              them as well as receive their mask. 
 
Name:         Sonata of Awakening 
How to play:  C-Up, C-Left, C-Up, C-Left, A, C-Right, A 
Location:     Learned in the Deku Palace from the monkey being held prisoner 
Description:  This song really only has one purpose, and that is to make the 
              Woodfall Temple rise from the water. When standing on the 
              correct platform as Deku Link, play this Sonata to make the 
              Woodfall Temple surface from the watery depths below, allowing 
              you to enter. Other than that, this song really has no other 
              purpose. 
 
Name:         Song of Soaring 
How to play:  C-Down, C-Left, C-Up, C-Down, C-Left, C-Up 
Location:     Learned in the Deku Palace on a stone tablet up on a ledge 
Description:  You won't have to talk to anyone to learn this song, as it is 
              written on a stone tablet up on a ledge (near an owl statue) in 
              the Deku Palace. When you play this tune, you can warp to any 
              owl statue you've discovered throughout the game. Whenever you 
              see an owl statue, hit it with your sword and it will be added 
              to your list of places to warp. Whenever you need to get to an 
              area quickly, play this song to warp near it. 
 
Name:         Ode to Order 
How to play:  C-Right, C-Down, A, C-Down, C-Right, C-Up 
Location:     Learned after you defeat Odolwa, the Woodfall Temple boss 
Description:  This song will do nothing until you have collected all four of 
              the Guardian Masks in the game. Each time you defeat a dungeon 
              boss for the first time, you will get a guardian mask, there are 
              a total of 4 of them in all. Once you have all 4, and you play 
              this song, it will make the Guardians go to Clock Tower. You 
              won't be using this song until you are about 80% into the game. 
 
Name:         Goron Lullaby 
How to play:  A, C-Right, C-Left, A, C-Right, C-Left, C-Right, A 
Location:     Learned in Goron Shrine from the frozen Goron and crying baby 
Description:  You won't be learning this song all at once. First, you must 
              talk to everyone in Goron Shrine, then come back and talk to 
              the frozen elderly Goron (after you revive her) and she will 
              teach you the first few notes of it, telling you she forgot the 
              rest. Play what you know to the crying baby in Goron Shrine and 
              he will teach you the remaining 2 notes. When played, this song 
              does various things. It allows you to enter the Snowhead Temple, 
              but is also used for other things, like gaining heart pieces. 
 
Name:         Scarecrow's Song 
How to play:  [You make your own song] 
Location:     Created in Clock Town by you 
Description:  Go to one of the Scarecrows in Clock Town (one is in the 
              observatory, the other is on the left side of town in the item 
              shop) and you will be able to create your own song. It can only 
              be 8 notes long, and when you go back in time, it will be erased. 
              This song is pretty cool because you can make it up yourself. 
 
Name:         Epona's Song 
How to play:  C-Up, C-Left, C-Right, C-Up, C-Left, C-Right 
Location:     Learned from the girl at Romani Ranch 
Description:  Once you finish the challenge of popping 10 balloons while 
              riding on Epona, the girl will teach you Epona's Song, which 
              will call Epona when played anywhere in Termina. This is useful 
              when you need your horse, as she comes when you call rather than 
              you going to retrieve her (saves a lot of time.) 
 
Name:         New Wave Bossa Nova 
How to play:  C-Left, C-Up, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right 
Location:     Learned from the old man in the marine room in the Great Bay 
Description:  You will learn this after you drop off all 7 Zora Eggs into the 
              marine tank. Take out your Ocarina as Zora Link after the eggs 
              turn into tadpoles and the old man will teach you the song. Play 
              this to Lulu over in the Zora's Hole and she will awaken 
              the sleeping turtle, who will transport you over to the Great 
              Bay Dungeon, free of charge. 
 
Name:         Song of Storms 
How to play:  A, C-Down, C-Up, A, C-Down, C-Up 
Location:     Learned from the stone tablet after defeating Iron Knuckle 
Description:  This song was also in Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and it was learned 
              from the windmill man. When played, it will make rain fall no 
              matter where you are (even in dungeons.) Useful for some tasks 
              that require instant water (such as planting bugs or magic beans 
              to grow transportation plants.) This is probably my favorite song 
              in the game because it has a catchy tune. 
 
Name:         Elegy of Emptiness 
How to play:  C-Right, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Right, C-Up, C-Left 
Location:     Learned from the king's ghost once you defeat him in the ruins 
Description:  When played, this will make a stationary clone of each role 
              Link plays. You can have up to 4 clones at once (normal Link, 
              Goron Link, Zora Link, and Deku Link.) Useful for temporary 
              switches, such as the ones in Stone Tower. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                 Hidden Songs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Name:         Song of Double Time 
How to play:  C-Right, C-Right, A, A, C-Down, C-Down 
Description:  This song is basically the "Song of Time" only you press each 
              button twice. When played, it will warp you ahead in time, 12 
              hours to be exact. If it's morning, you can warp 12 hours ahead 
              so it will be night, and vice versa. That way, you can warp 
              ahead in time without having to sacrifice a day. 
 
Name:         Inverted Song of Time 
How to play:  C-Down, A, C-Right, C-Down, A, C-Right 
Description:  Guess where the name of this song comes from. That's right, it's 
              the "Song of Time" played backwards. This will slow down the 
              speed of the clock by 1/3 of it's normal speed. Useful when you 
              need a lot of time to complete something, also helpful when 
              performing random tasks (such as defeating poes, it will slow 
              down the poes movement.) 
 
 
=============================================================================== 
                                   X.  MASKS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   Most masks aren't just found out in the open, you have to do a certain 
task to receive them. Some tasks are as easy as talking to a person, while 
others may involve several steps. Below are the locations and how to get each 
mask, and they are listed chronologically from when you get them in the game. 
For descriptions of the masks (what they do) see the section following this. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mask Name                  Location/How to Receive 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Deku Mask                  After you get your Ocarina back from Skull Kid, go 
                           to the clock tower and talk to the Happy Mask Man, 
                           who will teach you the song of healing. Once you 
                           play the song of healing, the Deku Mask will fall 
                           off, and into your inventory. 
 
Great Fairy Mask           As normal Link in Clock Town, collect the fairy 
                           from the lake, and take it to the Fairy Fountain 
                           in Clock Town. The fairy will give you the Great 
                           Fairy Mask. 
 
Blast Mask                 While in Clock Town, go to the area where you got 
                           the map on any day at 12:00 AM. An old woman will 
                           walk by with a bag, followed by a burglar snatching 
                           the bag and running off with it. Hit him with your 
                           sword before he escapes through the exit and you 
                           will be rewarded with the Blast Mask. 
 
Bremen Mask                On any night at 12:00 AM in Clock Town, go south to 
                           the river, where you will see a man who looks very 
                           similar to the windmill man from Zelda: Ocarina of 
                           Time. Talk to him and hear his story, and he will 
                           give you the Bremen Mask. 
 
Mask of Kafei              In Clock Town, during the daytime, go over to the 
                           northeast part of town (where the bomber kid is 
                           blocking your path) and go through the door to the 
                           left of the bomber kid. Once inside, go through the 
                           door on the right, and talk to the woman sitting in 
                           the chair to receive the Mask of Kafei. 
 
Bunny Hood                 Once you've collected the Bremen Mask, leave Clock 
                           Town to the south, and take Milk Road over to the 
                           ranch. Go into the back area of the barn where you 
                           will find a man and several chicks walking around 
                           outside. Use the Bremen Mask, and press and hold 
                           the B button to march, collecting all 10 of the 
                           chicks. Once they are all collected, they will hatch 
                           into chickens and the man will give you the Bunny 
                           Hood to show his appreciation. 
 
All Night Mask             In Clock Town at 10:00 PM on Day 3, make sure you 
                           have the Giant Wallet and the max. 500 rupees, then 
                           go to the left part of town, where you can buy the 
                           All Night Mask from the shop on the 3rd 
                           day (only after you have stopped the burglar on the 
                           first day at midnight.) 
 
Odolwa Guardian Mask       Once you go through the first dungeon (Woodfall 
                           Dungeon) and defeat the boss (Odolwa) you will gain 
                           this mask, which is one of four Guardian Masks in 
                           the game. The remaining three can be collected by 
                           defeating other dungeon bosses and collecting their 
                           Guardian Masks until you have all 4. 
 
Mask of Scents             After you defeat Odolwa (Woodfall Temple boss) go 
                           over to the outside area of the Deku Palace. Swim 
                           through the water, taking the path on the left, 
                           until you come to the end with a cave entrance, go 
                           inside and you will see a Deku Minister. Put on your 
                           Bunny Hood, and talk to him. He will challenge you 
                           to a little race through the cave, and if you can 
                           keep up with him until the end, you will be rewarded 
                           with this mask (same type of race as with the 
                           Gravekeeper's Ghost in Ocarina of Time.) 
 
Kamaro's Mask              At 12:00 AM on the first night, take the north exit 
                           of Clock Town, and walk forward a bit until you see 
                           some platforms shaped like mushrooms. On one of them 
                           will be a man dancing, jump over to the mushroom 
                           platform and play the Song of Healing for him. This 
                           will remove his mask and put it in your possession. 
 
Goron Mask                 To get this mask, you'll have to follow a ghost. 
                           Once you get the Lens of Truth, use it to see the 
                           Goron Ghost, and follow it all the way up to the 
                           Graveyard in the main part of Goron Shrine. Play 
                           the Song of Healing for the ghost and you will 
                           receive the Goron Mask. 
 
Goht Guardian Mask         Once you finish going through the Snowhead Temple, 
                           and defeat the boss (Goht) you will receive this 
                           mask by stepping in the glowing orb. This is the 
                           2nd Guardian Mask, out of 4 total. The first one 
                           being the Odolwa Guardian Mask from the first 
                           dungeon (Woodfall.) 
 
Don Gero Mask              Prior to defeating Goht (the 2nd dungeon boss) go 
                           into the Goron Shrine (where the baby is crying) 
                           and you will see several un-lit torches. Get a deku 
                           stick from one of the pots and run around the 
                           village (wearing your Bunny Hood) lighting every 
                           torch you find. You must be quick, though, or the 
                           torches will go out. Once they are all lit, several 
                           pots on the ceiling will begin to spin. As Goron 
                           Link, do a spiked spin off the top of the Shrine, 
                           breaking the spinning pots 1 by 1 until they are 
                           all broken, revealing a chunk of meat. Take this meat 
                           to the hungry Goron on the ledge in the main part 
                           of Goron Shrine, and after he eats it, you will be 
                           rewarded with the Don Gero Mask. 
 
Zora Mask                  Once you reach Great Bay, look out into the ocean 
                           until you see a flock of hovering birds. Swim out 
                           to find a Zora lying in the water. Get behind him, 
                           and push him back to the shore, where he will walk 
                           a few steps, then collapse. Play the Song of Healing 
                           to him and you will view a cinema followed by you 
                           receiving the Zora Mask. 
 
Stone Mask                 After hitting the 2 owl statues in the Great Bay, 
                           warp to Clock Town and go to the swamp, where you 
                           need to buy a red potion from Koume for 20 rupees. 
                           With the potion, warp back to clock town and take 
                           the lower east exit, then call for Epona using 
                           Epona's Song. Ride up and into the mountain terrain 
                           area, hop over the two fences, and use the Lens of 
                           Truth on the circle of stones to the right. Give the 
                           fatigued soldier the potion when he asks for it, 
                           and you will gain the Stone Mask. 
 
Captain's Hat              Take the east exit of Clock Town, and ride epona 
                           through the mountain terrain (hop over the fences 
                           when needed.) Go up, past the graveyard until you 
                           get to the skeleton. Play the Sonata of Awakening 
                           to awaken it, chase it and slash it with your sword 
                           until it gives up. He will then remove the fire 
                           guarding a treasure chest, which you can open to 
                           get the Captain's Hat. 
 
Garo Mask                  Warp to the owl statue on Milk Road, and make sure 
                           you have at least 10 rupees, then take the path to 
                           the left of the owl statue to come to a little 
                           farm with two guys (same guys from Ocarina of Time.) 
                           If you have Epona with you and talk to one of them, 
                           they'll challenge you to a horse race, but you must 
                           pay a fee of 10 rupees. Pay it and race through the 
                           course (make sure you _never_ use all your carrots 
                           until the absolute end of the race) and once you 
                           win, they'll give you the Garo Mask. 
 
Mask of Gibdo              In the main part of Ikana (Ekhana) Valley (where the 
                           music room is, etc.) walk up the ramp on the left 
                           side of the valley until you come to a dried out 
                           riverbed with a cave opening on the other end. Go 
                           through the cave and walk toward the center of the 
                           hole with water in it to make a ghost appear. Play 
                           the Song of Storms to make the river start flowing 
                           again, then go into the music room when the girl 
                           is far away and head into her basement to find a 
                           human/gibdo. Play the Song of Healing to get the 
                           Mask of Gibdo from him, and to turn him back into 
                           normal. 
 
Giant Mask                 After going through the Stone Tower Temple 
                           (Illusion), you will find a mini-boss named Eyegole 
                           that you must defeat. After he's dead, a treasure 
                           chest will appear and it holds this mask inside. 
 
Gyorg Guardian Mask        Once you finish going through the Great Bay 
                           Dungeon, and defeat the boss (Gyorg) you will 
                           receive this mask by stepping in the glowing orb. 
                           This is the 3rd Guardian Mask, and final one. The 
                           first one being the Odolwa Guardian Mask from the 
                           first dungeon (Woodfall), and the 2nd being the Goht 
                           Guardian Mask from the 2nd dungeon (Snowhead). 
 
Twin-Mold Guardian Mask    Once you finish going through the Stone Tower 
                           Dungeon, and defeat the boss (Twin-Mold) you will 
                           receive this mask by stepping in the glowing orb. 
                           This is the 4th Guardian Mask, and final one. The 
                           first one being the Odolwa Guardian Mask from the 
                           first dungeon (Woodfall), the 2nd being the Goht 
                           Guardian Mask from the 2nd dungeon (Snowhead), and 
                           the 3rd being the Gyorg Guardian Mask from the 3rd 
                           dungeon (Great Bay.) 
 
Mask of Truth              Found in the Swamp inside the first Gold Skulltula 
                           House. After you locate all the gold skulltullas, 
                           and collect their tokens, you will be rewarded with 
                           this mask. For gold skulltulla locations, please 
                           look in the main "Walkthrough" section of this FAQ.

                           receive this mask. Please see the "Side Quests/ 
                           Miscellaneous" section to see what events are 
                           necessary before you get this mask, and how to get 
                           this mask. 
 
Couple's Mask              While doing the Anju and Kafei side quest, you will 
                           receive this mask. Please see the "Side Quests/

                           necessary before you get this mask, and how to get 
                           this mask. 
 
Romani's Mask              On the 2nd day in the morning, talk to Cremia inside 
                           her house (at Romani Ranch) then come back at 6:30 
                           PM to guard her milk shipment from the two burglars 
                           who will try to break the bottles. If you can 
                           successfully fend them off until Cremia delivers the 
                           milk, you will receive this mask.

Mask Name                  What it Does/Function 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Deku Mask                  When worn, this mask will transform Link into a 
                           Deku Scrub, allowing him to converse with other 
                           Deku Scrubs in the game. This mask also gives Link 
                           some new, special abilities, such as: Deku Launching 
                           from Deku Launcher pads, and water skipping, meaning 
                           he can do 5 jumps on water before drowning. As Deku 
                           Link, you also have the ability to shoot bubbles 
                           once you learn it from the Great Fairy. 
 
Great Fairy Mask           When you wear this mask, if there are any fairies 
                           floating within a certain radius, they will become 
                           attracted to the mask, and come toward you like a 
                           magnet. This is useful to collect those hard-to-get 
                           fairies in dungeons. This works for any colored 
                           fairy in any environment, but it does NOT work for 
                           healing fairies (the ones that look like Navi.) 
 
Blast Mask                 When worn, press the B button and it will cause 
                           Link's head to explode! Well, in a way, the mask 
                           is actually the item that explodes. This can be 
                           used in place of a bomb, but keep in mind that when 
                           used, it will do a small amount of damage to Link. 
                           Why? If you had a bomb strapped to your face and it 
                           exploded, do you think you'd take no damage by it? 
 
Bremen Mask                This mask has a rather special function, when 
                           worn, press and hold the B button and walk around 
                           while still holding B. This will cause link to play 
                           music on a flute, as well as do a little march. 
                           Use this mask to collect chicks and mature them 
                           into full-grown chickens at Romani Ranch. 
 
Mask of Kafei              In order to pick up the All Night Mask, 
                           you'll have to wear this mask. After getting the 
                           Blast Mask, on Day 3, with 500 rupees, put on this 
                           mask and talk to the man in the shop on the left 
                           side of town to buy the All Night Mask. 
                           Other than that, I have yet to find any other 
                           significant purpose for this mask. 
 
Rabbit Hood                Probably the most useful mask in the game next to 
                           transformation masks, the Bunny Hood greatly 
                           enhances Link's physical abilities. When worn, it 
                           allows Link to run 50% faster than normal Link, as 
                           well as enhances his jumping by 40%. You will use 
                           this mask a lot throughout the game, because some 
                           tasks require you to run fast or jump far in order 
                           to complete them, that's where this mask comes in 
                           handy. You can also wear it if you are in a hurry. 
 
All Night Mask             When wearing this mask, you will be given the ability 
                           to talk to Anju's grandmother. Talk to her in the 
                           Inn during the day on Day 1 or 2 and she will give 
                           you a heart piece. 
 
Odolwa Guardian Mask       This is used in combination with the 3 other 
                           Guardian Masks, at the end of the game to carry 
                           the moon. There is no way you can not get these 
                           masks, because you get one after each dungeon boss 
                           you defeat. There is no purpose for them in the 
                           game until you reach the ending stages. You cannot 
                           put this mask on either. 
 
Mask of Scents             Used to sniff out mushrooms. 
 
Kamaro's Mask              This mask has a similar function to that of the 
                           Bremen Mask, because when you wear it and press/hold 
                           the B button, Link will do a little dance. After 
                           you get it, go over to the 2 dancing girls in Clock 
                           Town on any day during the night, wear the mask, 
                           and press B to teach the girls a new dance. They 
                           will reward you with a heart piece for it. Other 
                           than that, I have not yet found any other use for 
                           this mask. 
 
Goron Mask                 The Goron Mask is the second transformation mask in 
                           the game, and it allows you to converse with Gorons 
                           in ease. Aside from that, you will also gain some 
                           special abilities when wearing this mask, such as: 
                           Rolling, fire punching (has the same effect as a 
                           bomb) and Goron Stomping (A + B.) You will need this 
                           mask to get past certain parts of the game 
                           (specifically Goron Shrine/Snowhead Temple) and 
                           when you wear it, you can carry some items that are 
                           too heavy for normal Link (Meat, Powder Kegs, etc.) 
 
Goht Guardian Mask         This is used in combination with the 3 other 
                           Guardian Masks, at the end of the game to carry 
                           the moon. There is no way you can not get these 
                           masks, because you get one after each dungeon boss 
                           you defeat. There is no purpose for them in the 
                           game until you reach the ending stages. You cannot 
                           put this mask on either. 
 
Don Gero Mask              The name corresponds with it's function, because 
                           when you wear the Don Gero Mask, you have the 
                           ability to talk to Frogs! Using this, talk to the 
                           5 frogs (1 in Clock Town, 1 on Death Mountain, 2 
                           in the first 2 dungeons, and 1 in the swamp) to 
                           get a heart piece. So far, there are no other 
                           uses to this mask other than talking to frogs (from 
                           what I've seen, anyway.) 
 
Zora Mask                  The 3rd transformation mask you'll be collecting 
                           in the game. When worn, this will transform normal 
                           Link into a Zora, allowing him to talk to Zoras, 
                           and have special abilities normal Link doesn't have, 
                           such as: Underwater Swimming, Walking underwater, 
                           throwing swords, and breaking underwater boards. 
                           Useful to collect items underwater that you cannot 
                           get as normal Link. You'll be using this frequently 
                           when you reach the Great Bay area. 
 
Stone Mask                 When worn, the Stone Mask makes Link invisible 
                           to the naked eye, but only to the Gerudo guards. Use 
                           this mask when you enter the Gerudo Lagoon, and 
                           hitch a ride on one of their boats while wearing the 
                           mask, and they won't even know you exist! The mask 
                           pretty much only has 1 purpose for one area of the 
                           game, and it is not mandatory to use it, but it does 
                           help a bit. 
 
Gyorg Guardian Mask        This is used in combination with the 3 other 
                           Guardian Masks, at the end of the game to carry 
                           the moon. There is no way you can not get these 
                           masks, because you get one after each dungeon boss 
                           you defeat. There is no purpose for them in the 
                           game until you reach the ending stages. You cannot 
                           put this mask on either. 
 
Captain's Hat              When worn, you can command mini-skeletons to do 
                           certain tasks you couldn't before. As normal Link, 
                           these are enemies, but when wearing the Captain's 
                           Hat, they are your workers. Use this mask to command 
                           the mini-skeletons to break open the tombstone in 
                           the Ikana graveyard right after you receive this 
                           mask. 
 
Garo Mask                  This mask gives you the ability to talk to those 
                           weird guys with just one red eyeball and a hood 
                           covering their face. After you get the mask, head 
                           over to the mountains with Epona and talk to the 
                           guy sitting on the edge of the cliff near the left 
                           while wearing the mask, and he will leave you a 
                           tree to hookshot up to. You will also encounter 
                           weird Garo enemies when wearing this mask. 
 
Mask of Gibdo              You know those mummy-type enemies that shriek when 
                           you come near them? Well, when wearing this mask, 
                           they won't hurt you anymore, but instead, they will 
                           talk to you! Even if you don't want to talk, they 
                           won't even attack you, they'll just pretend you are 
                           one of them (they are easily fooled, I guess.) 
                           Very useful for different areas of the game where 
                           you can find Gibdos. 
 
Giant Mask                 This mask uses up the most magic out of any other 
                           item or action you do. When worn, Link will become 
                           10 times bigger, but the downfall is that you can 
                           only use this mask when fighting the 4th dungeon 
                           boss (Twin-Mold.) When using it, make sure you have 
                           several green potions, because it eats up magic 
                           within the blink of an eye. 
 
Twin-Mold Guardian Mask    This is used in combination with the 3 other 
                           Guardian Masks, at the end of the game to carry 
                           the moon. There is no way you can not get these 
                           masks, because you get one after each dungeon boss 
                           you defeat. There is no purpose for them in the 
                           game until you reach the ending stages. You cannot 
                           put this mask on either. 
 
Mask of Truth              When worn you can talk to the gossip stones to 
                           reveal certain secrets and facts about the 
                           characters and dungeons. When you reach the moon, 
                           there are many of these in each dungeon, but all 
                           they do is explain where you get each mask in the 
                           game, nothing big. 
 
Keaton Mask                Find a patch of those bushes that start moving when 
                           you attack them. Before you attack them, put on the 
                           Keaton mask, then after they bury themselves in the 
                           ground (it is ok to attack them), Keaton will 
                           appear. He will ask you five questions (answers in 
                           side quest section) if you get them right, he will 
                           give you a heart piece. If you summon him again 
                           later, he will give you 20 rupees. 
 
Couple's Mask              There are 2 purposes for this mask (which is rather 
                           difficult to get), which are: 1.) to wear it in 
                           front of the Mayor and talk to him for a heart 
                           piece; and 2.) To use it on the Moon to get the 
                           Fierce Deity Mask. 
 
Romani's Mask              When worn, go to the Milk Bar in East Clock Town 
                           after or at 10:00 on any day and they will let you 
                           in because you are a "member." This mask is helpful 
                           for some tasks that need to be done in the milk bar  
                           after ten (in fact, it's required.) 
 
Fierce Deity Mask          When worn (only when in battle with bosses,) this 
                           mask will transform you into a older looking link. 
                           He is much more powerful than normal Link and makes  
                           the final boss battle about a hundred times easier, 
                           because you can attack Majora in Phase 1 without 
                           hitting him from the back.

                          XI.  HEART PIECE LOCATIONS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   If you've played Zelda: Ocarina of Time, you will be rather familiar with 
the heart pieces in the game. Well, they are back in Zelda: Majora's Mask, and 
this section tells you were to find them all. Here's the lowdown: Link's life 
meter is composed of hearts. There are 2 ways to increase your life meter, you 
can either: a.) collect a total of 4 heart pieces which make up 1 container, OR 
b.) collect a heart container after defeating a boss. 4 Heart Pieces make up 
1 Heart Container, and each heart container increases your life meter by one 
heart. Of course, the REAL challenge is to beat the game with only 3 hearts, 
but that's only for gamers who are very skilled with the game. 
 
   Heart Pieces are found in several places, sometimes they are hidden, 
sometimes they are visible, sometimes you have to do a certain action or 
talk to a certain person to get one, some of them require lots of work, while 
others are very easy to collect. In the pause menu, you can see how many heart 
pieces you have currently collected. Every 4 heart pieces will make your life 
meter increase by 1 heart. After defeating a dungeon boss (not mini-boss) you 
will automatically gain a heart container (4 heart pieces put together in 1 
container) and your life meter will increase by 1 heart.

                                  Clock Town 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   will notice a tree with a Heart Piece in the center of it. Using the boxes 
   and platforms near the tree, jump over to collect it. 
 
2. In the main part of town (where the Clock Tower is) give the Deku Merchant

   collect the heart piece. 
 
3. On the left side of town, visit the room with a man sitting on a platform. 
   Pay him 10 rupees to play the log-chopping game, and chop all of the logs 
   that appear by using overhead/jumping attacks. If you score at least 30, you 
   get the heart piece. 
 
4. Collect 5,000 rupees from the many bushes outside of Clock Town, then take

   with the Heart Piece. 
 
5. Once you receive the Bunny Hood, use it to chase the postman all around

   section) and you'll get the heart piece. 
 
8. Take the Land Title Deed you got from the Deku Merchant in Clock Town to 
   the Inn on the right side of town after 12:00 AM on any day. Use the Deku

    Deku Scrub that will sell you a heart piece for 100 rupees after you  
    refuse its first offer.

    a room with two giant Dodongos. Kill both Dodongos to get a heart piece.

    leads to a room with gossip stones. Play the Goron's Lullaby to each of the 
    4 stones to gain a Heart Piece.

    take to get to Milk Road. As you are walking through the tall grass, walk 
    around the Deku Baba in the grass and you will fall through a grotto into 
    an underground area with a pea hat inside. Kill it to get the heart piece.

    down the hole. Shoot down one of the beehives on the ceiling and the heart  
    piece will fall into the water. Be careful because there is a Bio Deku  
    Baba in the water.

    a tree with a heart piece on it. Climb it using the vines to collect the

    normal Link, she will challenge you to a game of archery. Shoot at least 
    30 targets before the boat ride is over to gain the Heart Piece.

    path to enter a maze. Go through the maze, making sure you avoid the 
    deku guards (who will throw you out if their lights touch you) until you 
    reach the end, where a heart piece will be waiting.

                               Mountain Village

    bought the map) and dive under to get the heart piece from a treasure chest 
    near the ramp. You can only get it when wearing the Zora Mask, so remember 
    to visit this area again (after you get the mask.) 
 
30. Once you get the Don Gero Mask, use it to talk to the 5 frogs in the game, 
    located in: 
 
    - Clock Town: Near the tree at the Laundry Pool.

=============================================================================== 
                              XII.  ENEMY LISTING 
=============================================================================== 
 
   You will notice several returning enemies from past Zelda games here, and 
a few new enemies (but not many.) Below are descriptions of each enemy, their 
attacks, and how to kill them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                     Armos 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These immobile statues look ordinary in certain areas of the game, but when 
touched by a punch or a sword slash, they come to life and start spinning and 
attacking you. Use your fire punches as Goron Link to kill them, but take 
cover, as they explode when they die. You will find these in the Ikana Ruins 
as well as in other parts of the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Bad Bat 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The Bad Bat is a returning enemy from previous Zelda games. It's just a 
lower quality name for "Keese" These are nothing but black bats that hang 
around trees and in damp dungeon like areas. They like to attack from behind, 
so be careful when you see them. When attacking in swarms, they are very 
dangerous because they constantly attack you and you don't have a chance to 
attack back. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Beamos 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These pieces of machinery have rotating heads that shoot a laser out of 
them whenever you walk by. The only way to kill them is to throw a bomb at 
them, and watch as the head separates from the body and explodes. Using a 
sword or any other item/weapon on these will not kill them, it must be a bomb 
or the Blast Mask. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Big Octo 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   A larger version of Octorok, only with a shell. He was a mini-boss in 
Zelda: OoT, but now he has been lowered to a simple minion. He blocks some of 
the tunnels of the Southern Swamp, and he's invincible... well, almost. Along 
your boat ride through the swamp, you can kill Big Octo by running him over 
with your boat. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Big Poe 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   I've only seen a few of these in the game. They are the same type of Poes 
as the normal ones, only much larger and more powerful. You can kill these 
with 4-5 arrows from your Hero's Bow. When defeated, these leave behind a 
flame that you can capture in a bottle and sell to the Curiosity Shop owner. 
There is one of these in the underworld, and you can use his flame to give 
to one of the gibdos. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                 Bio Deku Baba 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are just another version of standard Deku Baba, only they hang upside 
down on little pads, and are usually found underwater. They are easily killed 
using Zora Link's boomerang fins, or can be killed using any other weapon of 
choice. If you get too close, they'll snap at you, and if you stand on their 
pads, they'll attack from below, knocking you off. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Black Boes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   You will find Black Boes everywhere in the first temple and in other areas 
of the game. They are rather hard to see in dark rooms, as they are a very 
dark shade of black, and look like little balls of shadow. They are rather 
easy to kill, and they don't do much damage to you if you let them get too 
near. They usually like to travel in large masses, and sometimes drop from 
the ceilings of dungeons. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Blue Bubble 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are a returning enemy from Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and they are very 
hazardous if they hit you. They are flying skulls with a blue flame 
surrounding them, and if they touch you while the blue flame is still burning, 
your sword will temporarily be unavailable for use. They take two shots to 
kill, one to get rid of their wings and blue flame, and another to kill them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Blue Chucu 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   This is just a normal, transparent Chuchu, and you find them in certain 
dungeons. These Blue Chucus can be frozen with Ice Arrows and be used as 
platforms to help you get to unreachable areas. They don't really have a color 
to them (just a light shade of blue) and they don't have anything in their 
stomachs, they are used just for freezing purposes. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                 Blue Tektite 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These spider enemies are located near Mountain Village and Goron Shrine. 
They were also in Ocarina of Time, and their primary (and only) attack is to 
jump up and down in your path trying to harm you. They can easily be killed 
with a few slashes from the sword, but make sure you keep your distance, or 
you could end up losing a bit of energy. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                           Deku Baba (Tall Version) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These Deku plants pop up from the ground when you come near (you can tell 
with the music that starts playing) but they don't do any damage to Link. 
Slash them with your sword to pick up a Deku Stick. You will find these 
mainly in the swamp area or near/inside the Woodfall Temple. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Desbreko 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   You will find this enemy when you fight Gyorg in the Great Bay Dungeon. 
It's basically a stronger version of the skullfish enemy, and when it attacks 
you, you'll lose a little bit of damage, but make sure you don't get caught 
by several of these things, because they can kill you very quickly when they 
travel in masses. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Dexihands 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are hands with skinny arms attached to them, and you'll only find 
them above openings in the Great Bay Temple. If they grab you, they won't 
do any damage, but they will toss you back in the direction you came from. 
You can kill them by standing on the ocean floor as Zora Link and using your 
boomerangs to kill them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Dinofols 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These giant lizards are very hard to kill. You can only kill them by 
hitting their tails with bombs (or by slashing their tails), and to do so, 
you must at the same time avoid being hit by their fire breath. These are 
returning enemies from Zelda: OoT only now they are much larger. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Dragonfly 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   You will mainly find these in the area near the Deku Palace and inside 
the Woodfall Temple. If attacked by them, you will lose some health as well 
as be knocked to the floor. They seem to have electric tails which cause 
damage to Link. Kill them with a long distance weapon or item. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                     Eeno 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   An Eeno is a snowball type creature that emerges from the ground (mainly 
found on Termina Field, near the entrance to Snowhead) and will throw 
snowballs at you. There are two types of Eenos, normal ones, that you can 
kill with a slash of the sword (or Goron Punch) and then there are larger 
versions of them, which, when hit will break down into 3 normal Eenos that you 
must kill, beware of these enemies. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Fire Keese 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These Keese are the same as the normal Keese, only their bodies are 
engulfed in flames. If they fly into you, you will take 2x the damage than you 
would with a normal Keese, so try and kill them before they see you, or you'll 
be losing a bit off of your health meter. Their favorite place to hang around 
is near trees or in dungeons, and they look like bats with flames on them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Floormaster 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   You may remember these from past Zelda games, the Floormaster is basically 
just a giant hand that will do a lot of damage to you if it gets hold of you. 
They are very sensitive to sunlight, and if touched with a ray of light, they 
will automatically be split into three pieces, which can then be killed with 
more sunlight. If there is no sun available, you can just use your sword to 
kill them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Freezard 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Freezards are rather dangerous, due to the fact that they can harm you in 
more than one way. They blow icy breath at you, and if it touches you, you 
will become frozen and lose quite a bit of energy on your health meter. The 
easiest way to kill them is with a fire arrow to melt them. You will find 
these mainly in the Snowhead Temple or in other icy places in the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Giant Bee 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are usually inside of beehives, so be careful which ones you shoot. 
Once they are out, they never seem to leave you alone until you kill them. 
Just use your sword to dispose of them, as they only travel in groups of one, 
sometimes two. Not much to worry about when it comes to counter-attacks. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                Gold Skulltulla 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Gold Skulltullas aren't as mobile as the normal skulltullas, and they move 
in a different manner, and are easier to kill in some situations. You will 
find them in each of the Gold Skulltulla houses in the game, 60 in total. 
You can kill them with any weapon of choice, and when killed, they leave a 
token behind that you can collect. These spiders can do damage to you, but 
only if you walk into them or touch them. Otherwise, they are very easy to 
defeat. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Green Chucu 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Another enemy that roams the overworld and swamp area. These are the same 
type of enemies as the Red Chuchus, only they are green and carry magic 
containers in their stomachs. They are in blob formation, and of a dark green 
color, and note that they can do harm to you. Kill them if you are low on 
magic (check your magic meter frequently.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                     Guay 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   This black bird will swoop down and hit you (in a similar way the 
dragonflies do) as it's attack. As it's coming down to hit you, give it a 
slash or two with your sword, and if it's still not dead, repeat when it tries 
to attack you again. You will encounter these many times throughout the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Hiploop 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These bug-like enemies are rarely found in the game (mainly in the Woodfall 
Temple) but are a potential threat. When you come to one, it will begin to 
charge after you, so you'll have to run quickly after it starts to change you. 
As Deku Link, shoot a bubble at it to stun it, followed by another bubble to 
kill it off. If you aren't careful, these enemies can knock you off thin 
platforms in certain areas. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Ice Keese 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   This is the third type of Keese in the game, and it's body is surrounded 
in a blue icy flame. This type of Keese is the most dangerous because not only 
will it do damage to you, it will also freeze your body and make your sword 
inaccessible for a limited amount of time. There are a lot of these bats 
around the snowhead temple and near the entrance of the Snowhead Temple, 
so just make sure you don't get hit by one. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                     Keese 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The Keese is a returning enemy from previous Zelda games. It's just a 
fancier name for "Bat." These are nothing but black bats that hang around 
trees and in damp dungeon like areas. They like to attack from behind, so be 
careful when you see them. When attacking in swarms, they are very dangerous 
because they constantly attack you and you don't have a chance to attack back. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Leever 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The Leevers live on the Beach, and will emerge from the ground whenever 
Link comes near. If you are riding Epona, you can just step on these without 
taking any damage, but as any other form of Link, you'll have to kill them 
with either your sword or whatever attack you have. You must, however, be 
quick because these things spin very fast and will hit you before you get 
a chance to hit them if you aren't careful. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Like Like 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These enemies are located both on land and underwater, and can do some 
massive damage if they capture you. They look like giant blobs, and if they 
suck you up into their interior, you will lose quite a bit of energy, and 
sometimes even lose an item! You can kill them with any weapon or item you 
choose, but it takes three hits to defeat them. The reward, however, is rather 
nice because you will get at least 15 (sometimes 20) rupees from them. One 
of these creatures will even cough up a heart piece in the Great Bay area. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Mad Scrub 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are basically Deku Scrubs (who look similar to Deku Merchants) only 
they will burrow into their pods and come back up to shoot deku nuts at you. 
They can be killed by using a long distance weapon or item. Block their 
attacks with your shield. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Mini Baba 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Yet another Deku Baba type plant. These Mini Babas are hardly any threat 
at all, as the only way they can possibly do harm to Link is if you directly 
walk into them. They are very small (almost ground height) and make snapping 
motions. They can easily be killed with a slash of the sword, and they appear 
in the same places as both versions of the normal Deku Baba. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Octorok 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Octoroks are those annoying creatures that linger in the water and hide 
whenever Link gets too close to them. They were found in Ocarina of Time, and 
they are back in this game. They will shoot little seeds at you, and if you 
aren't blocking them, you will take damage. If you get too near, they will 
just hide in the water until you are within far distance of them. You can 
freeze these with an ice arrow and use them as a platform. They are located 
in a few dungeons and there is one near Ikana Canyon. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Pea Hat 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   You may remember this enemy from Hyrule Field in Ocarina of Time, well it's 
back, but you won't be seeing too much of it this time. The only time I've 
encountered it was in an underground grotto, in which you defeat it for a 
heart piece. This enemy will shoot things out of it's top that will attack 
you, then after you bomb it, it will start spinning toward you. Hit the bottom 
of it to deal damage and kill it. These can cause a lot of damage if you 
aren't careful. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                 Pea Hat Larva 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are the enemies the pea hat will spit out at you before you bomb it. 
They fly around the room and attack you, so watch out. They can be killed with 
one shot, but if they start attacking Link in swarms, you'd better just run 
for your life, because they can deal out a lot of damage when they attack in 
batches of 10 or 20. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                      Poe 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The poes have returned from previous Zelda games, and are located mainly 
in the Stone Tower Temple. They appear out of thin air, and first they 
taunt you to make you try and chase them. When you stop, they will start 
swinging the lamp they have in their hand, and they _can_ do damage to you. 
Kill them before they knock you to your death. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                 Real Bombchu 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   I have been referring to these enemies as "Bomb Dogs" throughout my guide, 
but their real name happens to be Real Bombchus, which makes sense. They 
are weird looking creatures that carry bombs on their tails and will explode 
when touched with anything. They have a tendency to run into you when they 
see you, so it's best to kill them from a distance. If riding Epona, you can 
just trample over them without taking any damage. You will find many of these 
near the Ikana Graveyard and a few in random dungeons and on Termina Field. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Red Bubble 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Another version of the Blue Bubble enemy, these are surrounding by a red 
flame of fire and if they touch you, your sword will become inaccessible for 
a limited time. They look like skulls that hop up and down with a red flame 
of fire surrounding them. Avoid them as best as you can whenever you see them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Red Chucu 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These enemies are located almost everyone in the overworld. You will also 
find them roaming the path to the swamp. They look like big blobs of jelly, 
and you can see through them, revealing an item hidden in their stomachs. 
Usually, when you kill these things, and they pop, you'll get a small heart 
to replenish one heart on your meter, but only if you are missing any health 
from your meter. Otherwise, you'll most likely just get a rupee. These blobs 
are a very light shade of red, hence the name. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Shell Blade 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These clam-like enemies are rather difficult to kill. When you come near 
them, they'll start chasing after you, but that's the only way you can get 
them to reveal their sensitive inside, which you can then attack and kill 
them with. You will mainly find these underwater, and if there are more than 
one, you may be in danger, because they jump and attack rather rapidly. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Skullfish 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The Great Bay Dungeon has several of these creatures swarming around in its 
waters. Skullfish are exactly what they sound like, the skeletons of fish that 
swim around and attack you. They are hard to kill without aiming at them 
first, which is why it's very easy to kill them using Zora Link's boomerang 
fins, otherwise you can just punch them if they within reach. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Skulltulla 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The skulltullas are giant spiders that hang from their webs up in the 
ceiling and wait for you to walk by so they can drop down on you. To avoid 
being hit by them, walk up to lure them down, then quickly run out of the 
way when they drop. The front of their body is protected by a hard exoskeleton 
making it impossible to kill them from the front (except when using arrows.) 
Wait for them to turn around, exposing their sensitive backside and hit them 
with any weapon of choice to kill them. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                 SkullWulltula 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   A much smaller version of a normal Skulltula, SkullWalltula crawls along 
walls of caves and dungeons. One place, possibly the only place, you would find 
one of these spiders is in one of the grottos in Termina field. It doesn't 
have a hard skull-shell, so you can just smack it with your sword to kill it. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Snapper 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These enemies are similar to the skulltullas in the way that they can only 
be attacked on their stomach. Snappers are very dangerous because they spin 
attack you whenever you come near, and it is hard to get away from them, as 
they move very rapidly. You can lose a lot of damage in a short amount of 
time if you let one of these things get your better half. To kill them, you 
can flip them over using a bomb or by launching up from a deku launcher when 
they are spinning right over the pad and then slash their sensitive side. 
These are located in random places in the game (mainly in the Woodfall 
Temple.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                   Stalchild 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Stalchilds are mini-versions of a giant skeleton you fight in the game. 
You may remember them from Ocarina of Time (the skeletons that rose from the 
ground of Hyrule Field at night.) This time, you can either kill them or 
even actually talk to them! Once you get the Captain's Hat, you can command 
these Stalchildren to perform tasks for you, like breaking open tombstones. 
If you aren't wearing the captain's hat, you can kill them as normal. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                    Takkuri 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are probably one of the most dangerous enemies in the game. You will 
find these on Termina Field near Milk Road, and they look like buzzards. If 
you manage to kill one, you will gain 200 rupees, but the risk involved is 
cost worthy. These aren't just any ordinary buzzards, they are kleptomaniacs. 
They will steal valuable items from you, and the only way to get them back is 
to warp back to Day 1. If one of these happens to steal your sword, you'll 
have to buy it back from the Curiosity Shop for 50 rupees. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Wallmaster 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   Looking exactly like the FloorMaster, the WallMaster is a mummified hand 
that falls from the ceilings of dungeons, grabs Link, and throws him back to 
the beginning of the dungeon or area. When you see your shadow getting larger, 
start running around to get away from the WallMaster's reach, and kill it with 
your sword to get a large amount of rupees, but not that large. Also an enemy 
from Zelda: OoT. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  White Boes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   These are the same type of enemy the Black Boes are, only they are a bright 
shade of white. You will find them mainly in the Snowhead Temple (where they 
are harder to see because of the snow) and they attack the same way the Black 
Boes attack, by coming close to you. They can easily be killed with a sword 
or a punch from Goron Link. If they hit you, you will take 2x the damage you 
would versus an attack from a Black Boe. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                     Wolfo 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   The name pretty much describes these enemies. There are two types of 
Wolfos: Snow Wolfos and Normal Wolfos. They are basically just wolfs that 
guard against all your attacks. The only way to hit them is when they try to 
attack you (by swinging their claws) which is when you can give them a slash 
of the sword of a fire punch from Goron Link. These are mainly found in 
the Goron Shrine.

                           XIII.  SECRETS/CODES/TIPS 
=============================================================================== 
 
   Below I have compiled a series of secrets/codes/and tips for the game. 
Currently, there aren't a bunch of them, but more will be coming as I discover 
them in the game. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                  Free Money  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   There are several methods to picking up some extra cash when in need of a 
little bit of money. First off, if you go into the area where the observatory 
is, but head to the left right when you enter the Bomber's Hideout, and bomb 
the cracked wall, you will find a treasure chest with a silver rupee (100 
rupees total) in it. If you deposit that money into your bank account, and warp 
back to Day 1, you can go back and do the trick again to get another 100 
rupees. Another method of easy money is to walk around Termina Field looking 
for songs written on the wall. If you play this song, some rupees will fall for 
you to collect. The last method I know of for getting free money is to kill the 
buzzards, but this can be rather dangerous. While fighting them, they may take 
valuable items that you will have to pay for to get back later in the game, but 
if you kill them, you will receive a huge rupee worth 200! 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                               Fixing the Signs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   First, chop up one of the signs either in the overworld or in a town or 
dungeon, then take out your Ocarina and play the Song of Healing to make the 
sign piece itself back together. 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                               More Free Money 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
a.  In East Clock Town, if you turn to your left when coming from the  
    Astral Observatory, you'll see a ramp going up.  Wearing the Bunny Hood,  
    jump across the platforms to the top of the Shooting Gallery.  At the end  
    is a chest with a silver rupee in it. 
 
b.  Near one of the Zora eggs in Gerudo Lagoon is a room with 4 Gerudo  
    guards patrolling around a chest.  Wearing the Stone Mask, you can find a  
    silver rupee inside. 
 
c.  After you trade the Ocean Title Deed to the Deku Scrub in Ikana  
    Canyon, you'll get a huge rupee. 
 
d.  After you get the heart piece in the Shooting Gallery in Clock Town,  
    if you get a perfect score again, you'll get a huge rupee. 
 
e.  After you get the Room Key from Anju, you can enter the middle room  
    on the 2nd floor of Stock Pot Inn.  Inside is a treasure chest with a 
    silver rupee in it. 
 
f.  Inside the "Employees Only" room in Stock Pot Inn is a treasure chest  
    with a silver rupee in it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                                Unlimited Fairies 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   An easy way to stock up on bottled fairies without wasting any of your 
rupees is to get them from pots or bushes. Near each owl statue in the game, 
you'll find a bush or pot containing a fairy in it. Collect this fairy, then 
go off-screen into another area, come back and the bush/pot will appear again. 
Continue repeating this method until you have the desired number of bottled 
fairies you want. Thanks to Aprosenf@aol.com for pointing this out to me.

=============================================================================== 
 
Q. How do I get the Great Fairy Sword? 
A. After collecting all the stray fairies in the Stone Tower Dungeon and return 
   to the Great Fairy Fountain, you'll get the Great Fairy Sword. 
 
Q. What's that empty space in the bottom-right corner of the inventory screen 
   for? 
A. That's where the Great Fairy Sword will be once you get it. 
 
Q. If I go back in time, do I have to replay a dungeon and beat that boss 
   again? 
A. This all depends on if you are trying to get an item (say you are trying to 
   get the Gilded Sword, and after you beat the boss you save your game, then 
   yes, you do have to fight him again.) You don't have to fight bosses a 2nd 
   time unless you have a reason to. Once you get the guardian mask and the 
   heart container from each boss, that's all you need. However, some items 
   that you can collect require the boss to be defeated, that's when you have 
   to fight the boss again. It's frustrating, I know, but that's why the boss 
   warp pads are in each dungeon, so you won't have to go through the dungeon 
   again, at least. 
 
Q. That vulture stole my <insert item here>! How do I get it back? 
A. Unfortunately, the only way to get back a stolen item from the eagles that 
   steal them is to go back in time by playing the Song of Time. However, if 
   the vulture stole your sword, you have to buy it back from the Curiosity 
   Shop for 50 rupees. This is frustrating for some people because they have to 
   replay a dungeon all over again if they are in the middle of doing 
   something, but eh, that's how the game was made, you'll have to live with 
   it. 
 
Q. I went to the Curiosity Shop at 10PM but he won't sell me the All Night 
   Mask, why not? 
A. First, you must stop the burglar on Day 1, 2nd you must have the Mask of 
   Kafei, 3rd you must have the Giant Wallet with 500 rupees, and lastly 
   you can go to the curiosity shop at 10:00 PM on the LAST DAY to buy the 
   mask from him. 
 
Q. I got the 5th bottle from the lady in the Milk Bar by giving her the 
   express mail, then I went back in time, but I don't have the express mail 
   anymore to get the postman's hat. Why not? 
A. After you go back in time, you have to start the Log Book side quest all 
   over again to get the express mail. 
 
Q. What happens if I don't fill up the log book? Will my ending change? 
A. The Log Book keeps track of all the people you talk to in the game. Part of 
   the log book (All parts dealing with Anju and Kafei) is mandatory unless 
   you want a different ending. So, the majority of the log book is optional, 
   but the Anju and Kafei parts are not. See the "Side Quests" section on 
   how to complete the Anju and Kafei section. (Thanks to The 64 Chimp) 
 
Q. Is this going to be the last Zelda game made for the Nintendo 64? 
A. From the looks of it, yes. I doubt anymore Zelda games will be made for 
   the Nintendo 64, but there will be several to come on the GameCube and 
   Gameboy Color/Gameboy Advance. 
 
Q. How many temples are in the game? 
A. Four: Woodfall, Snowhead, Great Bay, and Stone Tower. 
 
Q. Isn't there an easier way to defeat Gyorg? 
A. Yes, actually you can stun him as normal Link by standing on the platform 
   with an arrow, then ram him with your shield as Zora Link (use the R button) 
   (Thanks to The 64 Chimp) 
 
Q. Is this game better than Ocarina of Time? 
A. They are equally alike. This game is a bit shorter than Ocarina of Time, but 
   there are more features to it than before. (You'd be surprised at how many 
   e-mails I get asking this question.) 
 
Q. What's up with these "Item Collection" things? Are they optional? 
A. After certain areas of the game, you can do various things, and collect 
   various items. It is optional, but you may need some of these items in 
   the future, so I suggest you do all of them. 
 
Q. Once I get a mask, can I go back in time to get the mask again and again? 
A. No, once you get a mask and save your game, that mask is yours to keep. 
   If you go back in time, you'll still have that mask, and by talking to the 
   person who gave you the mask isn't going to do anything. (Somebody asked 
   this question.) 
 
Q. When did the U.S. version of Majora's Mask come out? 
A. October 26, 2000. 
 
Q. Are there any differences between the US, JP and EU versions of the game? 
A. There are 2 known differences: 1.) The saving system will change in the 
   US version, and 2.) the cinema of when you see Epona will be different, 
   otherwise the names/items/gameplay are all the same. 
 
Q. How do I get past (insert game area here)? 
A. Read the Walkthrough, if it's not listed, it will be soon. Please don't 
   ask me questions about parts of the game I have not yet covered, but if 
   you are unclear about something, by all means ask. 
 
Q. How many masks are in the game? 
A. 24 total, combination of Transformation Masks & Normal Masks 
 
Q. Can I transform into 24 different things? 
A. No, there are 4 transformation masks, 19 regular masks, and one mask that 
   lets you transform into Giant Link, but only for one battle. 
 
Q. Are the controls the same as before (in Ocarina of Time?) 
A. When playing as Normal Link, yes, but other characters have different 
   controls. See the "Overview" section for more on the controls. 
 
Q. What can I transform into? 
A. Deku Link, Goron Link, Zora Link, and Fierce Deity Link (you can also 
   transform into Giant Link, but only for one battle.) 
 
Q. How is my money (rupees) stored in the game, do I have wallets? 
A. You can now deposit your money in a bank account, and you will gain bigger 
   wallets throughout the game. You start of with a Child's wallet and upgrade 
   to an Adult Wallet, and finally a Giant Wallet. 
 
Q. What's with this new time thing? 
A. You have 3 days before the game ends. On day 3, you play the Song of Time 
   to warp back to Day 1. It's kind of hard to explain, but you can understand 
   more in the "Overview" section. A lot of tasks can only be done at certain 
   times, or certain days.
