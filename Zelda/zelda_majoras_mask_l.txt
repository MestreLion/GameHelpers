  The day Ocarina of Time was released, The Legend of Zelda series took too a
  peak of supremacy that dominated the gaming community for months. The only
  question that could be asked afterwords was quite simple. Was there going to
  be a sequel? In May of 1999, the word made its way out. There was going to be
  a sequel. The sequel's codename was Zelda Gaiden, which would later become
  Majora's Mask and change the face of gaming completely with its absolutely
  stunning gameplay, music, special effects, and graphics.

  Released on October 26th, 2000, Majora's Mask was one of the most excellent
  games to hit the market. To a small percentage of others, the game was a
  failure. However, did those who think it failed play enough to understand its
  unique qualities and distinctive gameplay? For the few who might not know,
  some of the features of Majora's Mask include (but are not limited to)
  special abilities such as being able to change time, dozens of complicated
  side quests, brand new weapons featuring exquisite powers, playing as a
  younger Link but being able to use weapons such as the Hero's Bow and the
  Hookshot, and finally collecting masks which have the ability to alter your
  powers and/or change your form.

  Now, the reason I wrote this guide might seem a little bit peculiar. As you
  might guess, I am an avid Zelda fan. I've played through just about all the
  games including Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past. Those two probably
  remain as some as the most popular games time has brought us. However,
  Majora's Mask resides with those. When I played Majora's Mask for the first
  time, I felt something different. Some sort of feeling that caused me to be
  completely addicted to it. Sure this game lived up to the success of Ocarina
  of Time but something was different. This game was, just by a hair, better
  than Ocarina of Time.

  I wrote this guide for a few purposes. One purpose being for this guide to
  evolve into a standalone resource to cover this game down to every nook and
  cranny. Another reason this guide was written was to cover this legendary
  game through aspects never used to cover it before.

  This guide was written in Microsoft Word in Courier New font at 10pt font. If
  you are viewing this in a word processor such as Word, than I suggest you set
  the page margins to 79 characters per line for best results.

  If you are using this guide as a quick reference to find something, then hit
  CTRL + F. Next, type in a keyword related to what you would like to find and
  then click find. Hopefully, after a bit of searching, you will have revealed
  something somewhat relevant to your search.

  This document may look funny or messed up in your browser. If it does, then
  try pasting it into a word proccesor such as Word, WordPad, or even NotePad.
  Then set the margins accordingly to what was told in the second paragraph of
  this section.

  Please note that the latest version of this guide can always be found on
  GameFAQs. If this guide is found anywhere else on the net, then please notify
  me immediately.

  What I'm about to say is quick and simple: I really like to insult the
  readers' intelligence (nothing offensive of course) but if you do feel
  offended, then please forgive me.

  If you need to find something, first check the walkthrough with CTRL + F,
  then read the Frequently Asked Questions Section, and finally, if you are
  sure that your question has not been answered in the guide, then email me at
  the_majical_sponge@hotmail.com (of course, only after you've checked out my
  Email Policies!)

  Let me give you a quick run down of how I do version numbers so that by
  reading this, you can get a general idea of how complete this guide is and/or
  if what you need is covered.

  I generally just add my  progress here and if I include a major update, I
  will jump by a maximum of a tenth. Otherwise, on smaller updates, I will
  increase this guides version by a hundreth. Or, if I'm still working on the
  same update for more than a day, I will leave the number at that of the
  previous day. Quite simple isn't it?


  Version 0.1 | December 25th, 2002 | 5KB | 2 Pages
    Basically, I've made some art and a table of contents. I'm still messing
    around with shapes and such for my section headers.

  Version 0.1 | December 26th, 2002 | 8KB | 3 Pages
    Come up with some section headers. I'm basically adding/formatting the
    guide.

  Version 0.15 | December 31st, 2002 | 25KB | 8 Pages
    I've finally finished formatting this guide and now I'm working on the
    structure and adding basic content. Happy New Year's Eve!

  Version 0.151 | January 1st, 2003 | 38KB | 14 Pages
    Today I've added a few more characters, added a prologue, and I also wrote
    a "3rd rate story" to start the walkthrough off.

  Version 0.2 | January 20th, 2003 | 74KB | 24 Pages
    Long time no update? Yeah. I've been slacking off lately. But I got back
    into the mood at random and now I'm really pumping out information. I've
    finished the first two sections and now I am working on the walkthrough.
    Boy this file is going to be huge. Oh, and by the way, due to a recent
    addiction to System of a Down, check out all their songs. Especially #10 on
    Toxicity, Metro, and of course good old Chop Suey.

  Version 0.25 | January 26th, 2003 | 93KB | 30 Pages
    More updates! Finished the format and added all the section headers. I've
    also added the walkthrough up to learning the Sonata of Awakening.
    Considering how big this FAQ is going to be, I fear what spell-checking it
    will be like ;_;'.

  Version 0.251 | January 29th, 2003 | 100KB | 32 Pages
    Today is my hilarious day. I've pulled so many jokes/funny things today
    that I decided to write funny intros to the appendices.

  Version 0.255 | February 1st, 2003 | 112KB | 35 Pages
    Happy Chinese New Year and welcome to the Year of the Goat! Today I added
    to the walkthrough so that it now covers all the way to about 1/5 of the
    Woodfall Temple. I plan to finish the Woodfall Temple up tonight AND add
    at least one complete appendices section.

  Version 0.3 | February 1st, 2003 | 120KB | 37 Pages
    Same date...two updates? Well, major update. I have completed the first
    dungeon! Now onto those pesky appendices. Tomorrow I'll probably pull of a
    full dungeon unless laziness gets the better of me.

  Version 0.31 | February 4th, 2003 | 122KB | 38 Pages
    Pretty hefty update you must agree. I designed a template for my
    item/weapon section and my bestiary list. This template should make viewing
    more pleasant and organized. Now for the "hefty" part. I've added a
    complete Bombers' Notebook guide! Yep! However, instead of going with the
    crowd and listing schedules and times and stuff...I spent nearly four hours
    writing mini-walkthroughs for each character and how to solve their
    problems! w00t!

  Version 0.35 | February 5th, 2003 | 140KB | 43 Pages
    Yesterday I said I "hefty" updated. Well that was my plan. All I ended up
    doing was the templates. However, today I added the Bombers' Notebook
    section, 1 bottle to the bottle location, and wrote up 1 mask to the mask
    section.

  Version 0.4 |March, 11th, 2003 | 156KB | 49 Pages
    Well it has been a while. I've actually been slow updating since around
    February 20th (very slowly) but I've been way to lazy to record it here.
    Anyway, I'm currenty working on the Snowhead Temple, I've added 1 more Mask
    to the Masks section, an Owl Statue Location, I've spellchecked and
    proofread a bit, and I've redesigned my item and weapon templates. Spring
    Break is near and I PROMISE that I will finish this guide 100% before
    Spring Break is over....well at least the walkthrough! If not..um..well,
    actually I haven't quite thought that far yet :D.

  Version 0.5 | March 16th, 2003 | 167KB | 41 Pages
    w00t! I finished up the Snowhead Temple today! Now to move on to that pesky
    little Great Bay Temple! I'll probably start that tonight and finish it up
    tomorrow morning. Then tomorrow night, I'll start the Stone Tower Temple
    and finish it the following morning and then I'll work like crazy on the
    appendices. This should hopefully be done by Friday...unless I slack off.

  Version 0.6 | March 22nd, 2003 | 214KB | 64 Pages
    Giant update. I've finally finished adding the Great Bay Temple including
    Stray Fairies as well as I'm working on getting to the Stone Tower! Could I
    possibly finish this tomorrow? The reason I've worked so much lately is
    that I'm on Spring Break! Anyway, I'll try and finish the walkthrough
    tomorrow. I'll try!

  Version 1.0 | March 27th, 2003 | 242KB | 72 Pages
    Entire Walkthrough Complete! Guide submitted! Appendices coming soon!

  Version 1.1 | April 11th, 2003 | 260KB | 77 Pages
    Lately, I've been trying hard to work on those pesky appendices, which has
    been hard bcause I've been writing a Wind Waker walkthrough at the same
    time. Anyway, I've done a lot in this update. First of all, I've compelted
    my Heart Piece guide with a lot of work. I've also added about 6 things to
    the items section, which remains still incomplete. I've also finished up
    the Endings guide. Expect the next update to finish the items/weapons,
    boss, and bestiary sections as well as anything else remaining.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  This section is basically a "Get-to-know" section where you can learn about
  major/almost major characters and the role they play in the story.


    Link - The Hylian Hero                                             02.02.01
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Link, a Hylian by birth, has been the star of all Zelda games so far.
    Raised in the Kokiri forest, Link has fulfilled his destiny in becoming a
    hero and saving many lives and places for death and destruction. In this
    game, you control Link on your quest to save Termina.


    The Skullkid - Masked Menace of the Woods                          02.02.02
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    A thief as most Skullkid's are, this one is unusually cunning. He stole
    Majora's Mask -- a mask so powerful, it knows no limits, from the Happy
    Mask Salesman. The mask has taken over his body and its up to you to stop
    him!


    The Deku Butler's Son - Deku Link                                  02.02.03
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    The rumored Deku Butler's son returns -- except his body is taken by Link.
    The Skull Kid turned Link into a Deku version of himself and with his new
    found powers, Link is too find a way to undo what's been done. By taking
    this form, Deku Link can hop on water, blow bubbles, and draw on the powers
    of Deku Flowers to fly!


    Elder Goron Darmini - Goron Link                                   02.02.04
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    One of the head-huncho's of the Goron tribe up north in Snowhead, Darmini
    was killed while trying to enter the Snowhead Temple. His ghost was
    discovered by Link who was given a mask containing his spirit by him. When
    Link used this ability to become a Goron, he grew stronger, could pound the
    ground, and could roll around in balls just like any normal Goron.


    Famed Zora Guitarist, Mikau - Zora Link                            02.02.05
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Famed guitarist of the band, the Indigo-gos, Mikau was killed in an attempt
    to save the lead singer of the band's seven Zora eggs. Link rescued him
    moments before he died. Mikau then left his spirit inside a mask he gave to
    Link. When Link draws upon the mask and becomes Mikau, he can pull of
    karate moves, dive/swim at fast speeds, and make electric shields
    underwater.


    The Deku Tribe - Dwellers of the South                             02.02.06
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Living in the Southern Swamp, primarily because Deku's are plant-like, the
    Deku's inhabit a palace surrounded by a lush tropical environment. Their
    inhabitance is located and surrounded by the flowing waters of Woodfall.
    Being a very stubborn person, the King doesn't allow any other tribe to
    enter his palace. He has an especially large dislike for monkeys.


    The Goron Tribe - Residents of the North                           02.02.07
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Residing in a shrine just east of Snowhead, the Gorons have adapted to
    harsh climates/weather. However, they are currently undergoing an unusually
    fierce snow/ice storm. The Goron's take much pride in the race, especially
    their hero, Darmini.


    The Zora Tribe - Occupants of the West                             02.02.08
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Known for their famed band, the Indigo-gos, the Zora's live in an
    especially luxiourious area residing in the Great Bay. This tribe is also
    vulnerable to environmental changes. The Zora's have always had a rivalry
    or dislike for the pirates that often plague the seas.


    Happy Mask Salesman - Profound Mask Collector                      02.02.09
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    After searching the face of the planet for Majora's Mask, he lost it at the
    hands of the Skull Kid. Returning from Ocarina of Time, the Happy Mask
    Salesman is the bearer of all masks.


    Anju - Inkeeper of the Stockpot Inn                                02.02.10
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Anju was once engaged to Kafei. She possessed the Moon mask and when united
    with the Sun Mask, it would turn into the Mask of the Wedded Couple. Kafei
    was determined to get this and he stole it. The Happy Mask Salesman then
    put a curse on him, turning him into a child. Red-headed Anju never saw him
    again and has been ever so dazed since his dissapearence.

  You might feel this section really isn't necessary. However, it truly is.
  I've gotten emails in the past saying things like "How do I start?" or "Where
  do I go?" or even "Which file do I pick?". So, I'm just going to clear it up
  nice and fast with this section.

  When you slide your Majora's Mask cart in, make sure the expansion pack is
  also in. Press start after watching the opening movie or as soon as you see
  anything. Click options and select what sound type your using:


    Configuration                                                      02.03.01
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Sound can often play a major role in one's enjoyment of a game. Hence I'm
    going to help you get the maximum out of it.

    Stereo is the base sound of all televisions that are fairly new. If your TV
    has speakers on both sides, set the sound to Stereo.

    Have an old TV you play games on like me? Does your old TV only have one
    speaker? If so, make sure the sound type is set to mono for a better
    result.

    If you are playing on a TV where you can plug headphones in, you can
    sometimes get a better sound quality and catch details you wouldn't always
    catch.

    Now, if you have a Dolby Surround Sound System, 1) I envy you and 2) USE
    IT! With a DSSS, you'll feel like your inside the game as it feels as if
    the sound is 3D.

    Next off, Z-Targeting! Z-Targeting is an important feature of the game that
    is widely used throughout the game. There are 2 options of configuration
    for Z-Targeting. The first one is called Switch. When using Switch, you
    simply Z to Z-Target and click it again to stop. Hold is for non-ameteur,
    hardcore Zelda fans. When hold is turned on, you have to hold Z for the
    entire time you wish to Z-Target.

    Lastly, adjust the brightness of your TV until the very left square is gray
    and the last square is black.


  Next, select File 1 or File 2, as it really doesn't matter. Next, enter a
  name up to 8 letters long and hit end. Go back, select whichever file you
  chose and hit yes to begin a game.

  Got the JP version of this game? Lost your instruction manual? Never had an
  instruction manual? Well, I'll satisfy your needs with this quickie control
  section that gives a basic explanation of the way the characters "work".


    Normal Controls                                                    02.04.01
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    The controls for the A and B buttons only apply to Link's Hylian form.
    Also, I prefer not to give a PoS drawing of a Nintendo 64 Controller like a
    lot of authors choose to do =P. For a more in-depth version of Link's
    Hylian maneuvers and techniques, check out 02.04.07.

    First things first, use the control stick to move Link around. The harder
    you press the control stick in one direction, the faster he will move.

    Next, press the A button to perform an actions such as rolls, grabs, etc.

    To operate your sword, use the B button in combination with the control
    stick for specific slashes.

    The left, bottom, and right C-Buttons are to be used to load and use items.
    The top C-Button is to be used to either talk to Tatl or to view the
    setting through Link's eyes (1st person view)See "C-Buttons" for a more in-
    depth look.

    The start button takes you to your sub-screens. There are 4 subscreens. For
    a more in-depth overview, tune into "Screen Layout".

    Press R to put your shield up and defend yourself and press L to toggle the
    map in the right corner on/off.

    Last, but definitely not least is the Z Button. The Z Button is extremely
    important as it allows you to Z-Target on nearby objects/people or if know
    one is around, you can also change the camera to face forward with the Z
    Button.


    Deku Link                                                          02.04.02
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Deku Link is the first "extra-terrestrial" form you acquire. As with any
    normal creature, Deku Link has his special powers and weaknesses. His
    abilities include:

    • The ability to use Deku Flowers to stay airborne for a limited time.

    • Using Magic Power, Deku Link has the ability to shoot damaging bubbles at
      enemies.

    • For a limited time, Deku Link can hop across water.

    Deku Link's downfall's include:

    • Deku Link doesn't fare well when put up against fire considering the Deku
      tribe traces its origins from plants and plants burn easy.
    • Deku Link doesn't survive most of the time when falling from large
      heights.


    Deku Link also has a number of special moves and noticeable differences
    from Hylian Link:

    Instead of a sword, by pressing A, Deku Link was quickly spin in a circle,
    hurting everything in its range.

    Hold B to shoot a bubble from a distance. The longer you hold B, the bigger
    the bubble is. Keep in mind that the bigger the bubble is, the more Magic
    Power it takes up.

    When up on top of a Deku Flower, press A to burrow inside of it. When it
    emits a cloud of pollen, release A to be shot up into the air. Using
    flowers as your propeller, you can move in any direction you please.
    However, this only lasts for a limited time so be sure to give a guess as
    to how far you will go. In, addition, press A at any time to stop flight
    and land.

    By moving on water, Deku Link can hop across the surface of the water 5
    times. If you can't reach wherever in 5 hops, Deku Link will be returned to
    the spot he originally jumped from.

    Deku Link's shield is also a bit different. Instead of having a real
    shield, Deku Link curls up into a overgrown Deku Nut with a hard outer
    backing.


    Goron Link (Darmini)                                               02.04.03
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Goron Link is a bit...bulky...as you might say, which, of course results in
    him being quite powerful and quite slow. Some of Goron Link's special
    powers include:

    • Goron Link can curl up into a ball and roll around at any time, which
      makes him go much faster. When fast enough, Goron Link's body will sprout
      spikes and armor, thus killing any enemy by rolling into the enemy.
      However, the whole spiked/armor power takes up Magic Power.

    • While in curled from and not moving, Goron Link can perform what I call a
      "ground pound", which of course can hurt fairly close enemies.

    • Goron Link can perform a series of attacks in the form of a punch. You
      can pull up to 3 consectutive punches with correct timing for a nice
      combo punch.

    Now, let's take into consideration Goron Link's downfalls:

    • Due to Goron Link's large size, he cannot swim, which also means he can't
      go into deep waters.

    • Also, due to his large size, Goron Link can't fall from heigh places.

    Just like any other special character, our buddy here has some tricks up
    his sleeve. Erm, wait, he doesn't have sleeves =|. Oh well:

    Press and hold A to curl up into a ball. If you move the control stick just
    as if you were walking, you will roll around. If you achieve a fast enough
    speed, spikes will emanate from your body and you will be able to defeat
    enemies by just touching them. Take note this uses up some Magic Power
    every second.

    Press B to unleash a punch so strong boulders will crumble. Press B 3 times
    consecutively for a nice punch-punch-uppercut combo.

    If you curl into a ball by pressing A and then stay still and press B, you
    will give the ground a mighty pound causing nearby enemies to flinch and
    the ground to shake in fear.

    Goron Link's shield is also one where he curls up into a half-sphere like
    shape and the showing part of him is a hard shell like backing.


    Zora Link (Mikau)                                                  02.04.04
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Ah, Mikau, a teenage Zora! Our friend here is very light weight, which
    gives him excellent speed and swimming abilities. Here are some of his
    hilight abilities:

    • Zora Link can move through the water and along the see floor at a
      pleasing speed.

    • Using Magic Power, Zora Link can create barriers of electric current.

    • Zora Link can attack with a up to three different blows.

    • At any time, Zora Link can fire his fins away as Boomerang's for long
      distance attacks.

    And now for the weaknesses:

    • Since the Zora's are water-based creature's, they fall easily at the
      hands of fire and ice.

    Now, on to Zora Link's special moves:

    At anytime in the water, press A to launch into a high speed swim. When
    going fast, if you push down and gradually bring the control stick up you
    can do the dolphin ;).

    While floating in the water, you can press B to sink to the bottom of the
    Ocean. Keep in mind, since Zora Link can breathe water, you can stay there
    for as long as you please.

    When not swimming, press B up to three consecutive times for a kung-fu
    style attack.

    Hold B, aim with the control stick, and release B to launch your fins of as
    boomerangs for an uber-cool long range attack. Take note that when his fins
    are out "flying" around, Zora Link is semi-disabled. Or in other words, he
    can't quite fend for himself to the maximum limit.

    Press R while swimming or press AND hold R + B to create an electrical
    current-based barrier. This serves as a good defense against enemy attacks.
    Remember, just as anything this good, it uses magic.

    When you press R to shield, Zora Link will place his fins in what seems
    like a defensive position.


    C-Buttons                                                          02.04.05
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    The C-Buttons are quite an important essence to this game. They provide
    important access to up to 3 items. The left, right, and bottom C-Buttons
    are used for the items. At the inventory screen, click any of the above
    mentioned buttons to load an item. In the game, press the corresponding C-
    Button to use the item. Keep in mind, all items cannot be used in all
    instances. For example, most items are obslete in the water and when in
    different form, main weapons such as the Hero's Bow, cannot be used.

    The last C-Button is C-Up. You can use C-Up in two instances. One, you can
    look through Link's eyes in 1st person view to get a nice picture of your
    surroundings. If you are Z-Targeting something, you can also talk to Tatl
    through C-Up.


    Z-Targeting                                                        02.04.06
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Z-Targeting is yet another essential feature of the game. Press Z at any
    time to Z-Target on nearby objects. When targeting nearby objects or
    people, when you move, you will move around them so you do not lose sight
    of them. If you keep your shield up when targeting an enemy, there is
    almost no way you can get hit (save long range attacks).

    Also, when you Z-Target enemies and talk to Tatl, she will often provide
    important tips such as the enemey's attacks and weaknesses. This can often
    decide wether you live or die. I conclusion, remember always to Z-Target.


    Manuevers/Technique                                                02.04.07
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Ever see these really cool jumps or tactic used before? Ever wonder how to
    do them? They're quite easy let me say. Just a little bit of practice and
    you'll be dodging enemy blows and doing double damage!

    • Jump Attack | Controls: Z + Forward + A
      Hold Z and press Forward and A to perform a jump attack. Link will lunge
      forward with his sword doing a lot more damage. This is my favorite move
      but it has one weakness. Due to the recovering time, if you miss, chances
      are you'll get hit by an enemy.

    • Backflip | Controls: Z + Backward + A
      Press Z and hold the analog stick back while pressing A. Link will
      perform a backflip. Backflips are good for dodging an attack and then as
      the enemy recovers, you can perform a Jump Attack if you are up for a fun
      time.

    • Side Jump | Controls: Z + (Right or Left) + A
      Press Z, (left or right), and A to perform a side jump. Another dodging
      move, the Side Jump is crucial when facing foes with larger swords or
      powerful long range attacks.

    • Power Slash | Hold B
      When you have Magic Power, you can hold B for any amount of time for
      unleash a very powerful attack, which involves Link spinning around with
      his sword so fast, it creates a longer attack range and hurts any enemies
      in the radius. This is nice for those tight spots.

    • Stab | R + B
      For a quickie stab, while defending with R, tab B and Link will quickly
      shoot his sword out.

    • Directional Slash | (Up, Left, or Right) + B
      Tap the analog in any direction and press B quickly to perform a sword
      slash in any preferred direction except down.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Saving in Majora's Mask is quite complicated. It isn't like Ocarina of Time
  where you can just hit Start and then B to save. Here in Majora's Mask, you
  have two options.

  The first option is called an interrupt save. An interrupt save is where
  during the middle of the game, you use an Owl Statue (will be explained in
  the walkthrough) to just stop the game at any point. The Owl Statue preserves
  all items/number of items you have as well as whatever you have done. If you
  perform an interrupt save and then go back to your game and stop it without
  saving again, you will lose all and have to continue from the latest FULL
  SAVE.

  The second option is the more complete option. Use your Ocarina and play The
  Song of Time and choose to warp back to the Dawn of the First Day. You will
  keep all your masks and "non-perishable" items but your item count for things
  like Deku Nuts and Arrows will reset to zero. However, since this is a full
  save, you can come back as much as you want w/o having to save again.

  Simply put, this game revolves around time. You have 72 TERMINIAN hours to
  complete the game plus warpining back in time and repeating this 3 day loop
  as much as pleased. Take note many things change according to the time of
  day. For example, people will do and say different things at different times
  of the day. The scenary and environment also changes. Nocturnal monsters come
  out in some areas as the sky gets dark. Some shops are close during the night
  and some are only open during the night. Crime can also happen during the
  early hours of a new day (i.e. around midnight).

  This section may make more sense as you play the game but it is necessary. As
  the Great Fairy of Magic will explain, the Skull Kid shattered all the Great
  Fairies and scattered their remains among dungeons. If you collect all the
  Dungeon Fairies of one temple and return them to the shrine (the shrine is
  generally near the temple you got the Fairies from) the Great Fairy wil
  reward you with something to help you on your quest.

  To get all the Dungeon Fairies takes a lot of work and experience. A good way
  to catch Fairies floating around risky areas is to wear the Great Fairy's
  Mask. The pink hair on the mask will sparkle when a Fairy is near and the
  Fairy will be attracted to you and float right into you. Sometimes if you
  find a Fairy trapped in a bubble, it will take an arrow to burst the bubble.

  Tatl, your current "Guardian" Fairy is your partner. She is there to help you
  even if she acts quite dumb at times. Always listen to her as she will
  provide life saving tips on how to complete tasks or on how to beat an enemy.
  She will also keep you going in the correct "general" direction as in what
  temples to do in what order, etc.

  If you ever here a high-pitched ringing tone, it means Tatl would like to
  talk to you. To talk to her, simply press C-Up, or the key you would normally
  use for first person view.

  When you are human again and play the Bombers' game, you will receive the
  Bombers' Notebook. The Bombers' Notebook helps you keep track of important
  meetings with people and their schedules. The Bombers' Notebook also keeps
  track of how many people you have helped. Information such as the Bombers'
  Hideout password are also stored here.

  To activate parts of the Notebook, you often have to talk to people to find
  out what troubles them and what time to meet them to help. When you solve
  their problems, a ribbon will appear at the end of their schedule. If you
  receive a mask for helping, a green mask (that looks like an alien) will
  appear ON their schedule. If you ever need help completing a certain task,
  refer to The Bombers' Notebook section in the Appendices.

  The rupee is the universal currency of all Zelda games. In Termina, the
  tradition continues. Money is essential during the game as it allows to you
  buy supplies and play mini-games. Now, unlike the our real world, money can
  be found everywhere.

  For example, if you slash up a bush, you will either get supplies or money.
  Often chests that have provided key elements of the game (non-purchasable
  supplies) will have rupees in them after you warp back in time with whatever
  was in the chest the first time.

  As in our world, there are many amounts of money. In Majora's Mask, a simple
  green rupee is one rupee. There are also blue rupees, red rupees, etc. There
  are even giant rupees. The amount you get always depends on the color of the
  rupee.

  You may know, when you warp back in time to the first day, you lose ALL the
  money in your wallet. However, there is a safe and easy way to making sure
  you never lose any money. Before you warp back in time, head to West Clock
  Town. In West Clock Town, head to the bank (see the map in the walkthrough if
  having difficulty) and ask to make a deposit. Deposit however much you want
  and get on with life. The bank won't lose your money when you warp back in
  time. Also, for some reason, the clerk always recongnises you even if you are
  in a different form. Also, you will be rewarded with some nice treats when
  you deposit certain amounts of money.

  / 02.11 /::/ Screen Layout                                                  /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  When you play Majora's Mask at first, there will seem to be many numbers,
  icons, and pictures on the screen that look complicating. There not that
  complicating once you know what they mean. So, without further ado, let me
  explain the screen layout of the game.


    Game Screen                                                        02.11.01
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    First of all, let us take a look at the screen you will be seeing the most,
    the game screen.

    Let us start with the top left corner. The hearts in the corner represent
    how much health you have. Once your heart supply has depleted to zero, you
    are dead. However, since Zelda has no life system, you will be revereted to
    the beginning of the area you where at and you'll start with only hearts
    filled. Also, since it would be a hassle to contantly keep an eye on your
    life force, the game will start beeping when you get low (i.e. when you're
    at 3 hearts).

    Also located in the top left corner, the Magic Meter is very important. It
    manages the amount of MP you have available to spend on magical
    powers/items. Note that the Magic Meter has to be earned as you don't start
    with it. When you first get it, it may seem small to you but keep in mind
    that it is enough until the upgrade becomes available.

    Now, moving on to the bottom corner. Remember ladies and gentlemen, keep
    all hands and feet in the vehicle as we tour. In the bottom left corner is
    your Rupee meter. It will monitor the amount of Rupees you have collected.
    All of the money will be stored in your wallet. Keep in mind though that
    you'll lose all your money whenever you warp back in time.

    Just to the right of the Rupee counter is the clock. The clock simply tells
    the time of day, if it is night or day, and what day it is. Keep in mind,
    this clock functions in Terminian.

    Now, moving onto the map. The map is located in the bottom right corner and
    can be toggled on and off with the L button. Keep in mind, you'll only have
    a map once you've either bought it or acquired it through a dungeon. The
    red arrow on the map will indicate where you entered the area and the
    yellow arrow is your current position.

    In the upper right corner lay the C-Button icons. These represent what
    weapons and items you have equipped. If you see another flashing C-Up
    button, it means Tatl would like to talk to you. When this happens, press
    C-Up. Otherwise, when you press C-Up, you will simply go to Link's first
    person view.

    Last but not least are the A and B button icons. Obviously being green, the
    B represents what kind of attacks can be performed at the moment. The A
    button (the blue one) indicates what kind of actions such as speaking and
    opening doors that can be performed in your current position.


    Sub-Screens                                                        02.11.02
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    When you pause the game by hitting start, you will be taken to 4 sub-
    screens, each being very useful. The first is the item select sub-screen.
    The item screen is just a diagram with lots of weapons/items on it. Just
    add a item/weapon for quick use to a C-Button slot, simply highlight the
    item/weapon and click any C-Button except for C-Up. Also, if you would like
    some basic info on any item, highlight it and press A.

    The next screen is the mask select screen. The mask select screen just has
    pictures of all the masks you currently posses. Masks are used like items,
    which means that they have to be loaded through the C-Buttons. To get info
    on a certain mask, press A while highlighting it.

    After the mask select screen is your quest status. The quest screen
    consists of many things. First, in the upper right hand corner are four
    slots. These are where your guardian masks are stored. In the bottom right
    corner are your current upgraded/default weapons (your sword, shield,
    quiver, and bomb bag). Just to the left of that is a bunch of musical
    notes. Each musical note represents a song you have learned. Press A while
    highlighting a note to hear the song and see it drawn out on the staff
    lines below. In the upper left hand corner is two things. There is a heart
    that keeps track of how close you are to getting another heart container.
    The other slot is for your Bombers' Notebook.

    Just after you scrool through the quest screen, you get to the map! The map
    has dots for all the locations you've visited. When you highlight a dot, at
    the bottom of the screen will be the name of the place your are
    highlighting. Note that some of the map may be fogged up or there may not
    be dots there. This is because you have not explored that area.

  Just try to remember a few things I need to say to you. Firstly, this
  walkthrough was written entirely on how *_I_*, yes I, played through the game
  my second time through. I don't care what someone else says. This is how I do
  it and you can't change that.

  Also note, some of the stuff I do is optional. I just include it because I
  felt that I should write my walkthrough a different way and make it so that
  you get an optimum ending of all the masks and all side quests done.

  Note that I have also included when to warp back in time. These too are
  optional. I felt the need to put them in because as I played this game for
  the first time, using a walkthrough when I got stuck (this was years ago so I
  don't quite remember whose it was). I noticed that they didn't cover it the
  way I wanted -- the optimum ending with all the masks as well as an idea of
  when to warp back in time. Due to the fact that even I sucked at this game at
  one point (one SMALL point :P) it cost me many hours of replaying. Anyway, to
  end my rant, I start the walkthrough. Onward!

  / 03.02 /::/ The Legend Goes On...                                          /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Some time had past since Link fulfilled his heroic destiny and became a
  legend after destroying the evil Ganondorf and sealing him in another realm.
  As he was returning the Master Sword permanently so he could return to being
  a young child once again, he and is Fairy Guardian, Navi, finally parted
  ways. Now that some time had past, he decided he would like to set out on a
  quest. A personal quest to find his long valued friend, Navi.

  Link, with his trusty Ocarina and horse, Epona, set off into the Lost Woods
  in search of Navi. As his surroundings grew vast, he began to lose his sense
  of direction. As he stopped to look around, he was violently thrown off his
  horse when Epona was scared by two fairies, Tael and Tatl. As Link was
  knocked unconscious, a mysterious mask panned into few, followed by the body
  of a Skull Kid wearing it.

  "Hee hee!" exclaimed the Skull Kid, "You two fairies did great!". "I wonder
  if he has anything good on him..." mumbled the Skull Kid. "Huh? This guy" the
  Skull Kid said with a puzzled look. "...Well, that shouldn't be a problem" he
  quickly added.

  The Skull Kid embarked in the direction of Link. With his foot, he kicked
  Link over so he was facing up. After searching Link's body, he came upon an
  Ocarina. As the Skull Kid blew a few notes, the male, younger fairy, named
  Tael said, "Ooh, Ooh! What a pretty ocarina...Hey, Skull Kid, lemme touch it!
  I wanna see!". As the Skull Kid cackled off with laughter, Tael's sister,
  Tatl smacked him and said, "You can't, Tael! What would we do if you dropped
  it and broke it? No way! You can't touch it!!!". In a whining voice, Tael
  responded, "...Aw, but sis...W...Why can't I try it out too?".

  As the Skull Kid continues to play notes, Link awakes rubbing his head.
  Angrily, he turns toward the Skull Kid. The fairies alert the Skull Kid and
  he slowly turns around. He quickly hides the Ocarina behind him and acts like
  nothing happened. Link stealthily lunged at the Skull Kid but the Skull Kid
  is too quick. He jumps on to Link's horse, Epona and rides off. However, Link
  manages to grab hold of Epona's leg and ride with them.

  The Skull Kid quickly makes a sharp right, throwing Link off into a tree
  stump. As you gain control of Link, run forward and slash up the bushes to
  gain a few Rupees. Make sure you get atleast 10. Then follow the Skull Kid.
  You will have to jump from tree stump to tree stump (notice the really cool
  flips Link does here) and enter a new area, which is when a cinematic begins.
  Link will fall of a great cliff. He landsin a dimly lit area on top of a
  small Deku Flower. After the Skull Kid cackles of about what he did to Epona,
  Link gets ready to attack. Suddenly, some lights flash and the Skull Kid is
  illuminated on the other side of the room. "What's with that stupid horse of
  yours?! It doesn't listen to a word that's said to it...There's no point in
  riding a thing like that, so I did you a favor and got rid of it...Hee,
  hee...Aww, boo-hoo. Why the sad face? I just thought I'd have a little fun
  with you...Oh, come now...Do you really think you can beat me as I am now?
  Fool!".

  Using his powers, Skull Kid then horrifyingly turns Link into a Deku version
  of himself! "Hee, hee! Now that's a good look for you!" the Skull Kid
  exclaimes, "You'll stay here looking that way forever!". As Link tries to
  follow Skull Kid out the door, he is stopped by Tatl. Suddenly, the door
  closes shut and Tatl and Link are separated from the Skull Kid and Tael. As
  Tatl rants on Link, she demands the door be opened for her so she can get
  back to her brother, Tael and take care of him.

  Ok, now the game is starting to begin. When you gain control of Link, turn
  around, go back and slash up the moving bushes for some more Rupees. If you
  don't know how to slash as Deku, you will learn very soon. Next, exit through
  the door the Skull Kid went through. Run to the end of the log trail and then
  Tatl will talk to you. Heed everything she says, as the C-Up stuff is
  important. She will also teach you two new moves, the Deku Flower Jump and
  the Spin Attack.

  Using your new found abilities, jump into the Deku Flower, wait until a cloud
  of pollen is splurted out, and then release A. Use the analog stick to then
  direct yourself to the other side of this room. Open the doors and continue
  forward.

  When you enter the new room, the doors will shut behind you and will bar up
  so you cannot go back. This room tests your new found ability to use Deku
  Flowers. First, start out by using the Deku Flower directly infront of you to
  get to the platform directly ahead. Use the Deku Flower you land near to get
  to another platform directly ahead but a bit higher than the last. Now, open
  the chest using A to get your first item...Deku Nuts! Burrow up again in the
  Flower closest to you and notice that to the right there is a barnacle like
  object. When you launch out of the Deku Flower, fly around the barnacle
  object to get to the next platform. From there, fly directly to the slim
  rectangular platform near the end. Z-Target and talk to Tatl as she will
  brief you about Z-Targeting and tell you to come over and check out the tree.
  Use the Deku Flower to do so. Then, exit the room.

  Link will walk down a long twisted path as the music starts to change and you
  will arrive in what appears to be a Clock Tower. As the door shuts behind
  you, run forward and venture up the bridge. At the top, take the stairs to
  the door. However, just as you are about to exit, you will be stopped by the
  Happy Mask Salesman from Ocarina of Time. Apparently, the Skull Kid stole
  Majora's Mask from him and he wants you to get it back. If you get it back,
  he promises that if you also get your Ocarina of Time back, he will change
  you back to your original form. However, note, you only have 72 hours to do
  this as he is a very busy man and is going to leave after that time period.
  Finish the conversation and exit the gloomy Clock Tower insides and enter a
  magnificent new world that will immerse you in your wildest dreams as The
  Legend of Zelda continues...

  Once you have exited the Clock Tower, a black screen will appear with the
  letters "Dawn of the First Day - 72 Hours Remaining", meaning, you have 72
  Terminian hours left in the game. Note that when night comes you will get a
  Night of the First day message and so on for each day. You probably catch my
  drift so back to the walkthrough.

  As Tatl supposedly thinks out loud and then correct herself, she will tell
  you to go to the Great Fairy's Shrine in North Clock Town. Obviously you
  don't know where North Clocktown is, so either refer to the map at the start
  of this sub-section, follow my directions, or refer to the Maps section in
  the Appendices.

  Head right, turn backwards, and walk up the ramp. Continue forward past the
  seemingly incomplete Owl Statue and take the ramp to the right. At the top,
  you should find only one exit. Take that exit to get to North Clock Town.

  Once you are in North Clock Town, walk up to the human in the elf suit named
  Tingle and talk to him. Once all is said and done, purchase a map from him
  for 5 Rupees. If you didn't collect the money like I instructed at the
  beginning of the walkthrough, then slash up some bushes just to the right of
  Tingle.

  Next, head left and take the ramp into the Great Fairy's Fountain. As you
  walk closer to the pool of water in the shrine, Tatl will exclaim something
  like "Oh no!". Go into the pool to find out that the Skull Kid shattered the
  Great Fairy. The only way to get her back is to find the one stray fairy,
  which is exactly what we are going to do now. Once the conversation ends,
  exit back to North Clock Town.

  After exiting the Fairy Fountain, trace you steps back into South Clock Town,
  and then to the exact spot in South Clock Town you started at. From there,
  head to the other end and take the staircase on the right into the Laundry
  Pool.

  As you head down the dirt road of the Laundry Pool, you will notice a Fairy
  hovering slightly over the water near the bride. That fairy is what you need
  to bring the Great Fairy back to normal. To claim it, simply run forward and
  into the water, directly facing the fairy. As you hit the water that is deep,
  your Deku abilities will kick in, causing you to hop on water. After 1 hop,
  you should have hit the fairy. It will tell you to return it to its master.
  To do so, exit the Laundry Pool through the dirt road you ventured down on,
  and go back to North Clocktown. Then, after that, head on over back to the
  Great Fairy's Shrine.

  As you step into the pool, the missing fairy will bond with the others,
  forming the Great Fairy. As a sign of her gratitude, she will grant you Magic
  Power, which allows you as a Deku to shoot bubbles. Before she goes, she will
  ask you to come back when your in your Hylian form and tell you to see the
  man in the Astral Observatory. For now though, your stuck like this for a
  while. Once your ready, go back to North Clock Town.

  Now it is time to try and join the Bombers' club. See that kid trying to pop
  the Majora's Mask balloon? Talk to him and when you are done, hold B, aim,
  and blow the balloon to pieces. After the balloon is popped, talk to the kid,
  Jim. He'll tell you that he can get you into the Astral Observatory if you
  pass his test. Agree to take the test, which is finding all the Bomber Kids
  by morning.

  This is only hard if you make it hard. In fact, if you relax and focus, it is
  quite an easy task. The first one is located just next to a tree near the
  entrance to South Clock Town. Just attack him to "catch" him. The next Bomber
  is located on the direct opposite corner of this area, behind the slide. When
  you catch him, go straight to the dirt road and take the entrance to East
  Clock Town (it is the only other way out besides South Clock Town).

  There are two Bomber Kids in East Clock Town. To get the first one, run up
  the stairs near the area where East Clock Town lowers in elevation. The kid
  up there will jump off the roof with a CuCu. Jump after him and catch him
  when he hits the ground. 3 down and only two more to go. See the treasure
  chest shaped shop on the right side of this town? Dive into the Deku Flower
  just near its entrance. You will notice that there is a straw awning just
  near the Flower also. Use the Deku Flower to get onto the straw awning. The
  Bomber ontop of the awning will immediately jump off when you land, so follow
  him and catch him. Now there is only one left! Use the exit just next to the
  awning to get to South Clock Town.

  From South Clock Town, go directly to the other side of the Clock Tower and
  enter West Clock Town. As you enter, you will notice the last Bomber
  patrolling just a bit away from you. Catch him to pass the test. All Bombers
  will gather and 4 will protest you joining the club. You aren't allowed to
  join and get a Bombers' Notebook, but at least they will tell you the code.
  Keep note of the code as it is different for every game. Now we head to the
  Astral Observatory. Use the entrance on the side of North Clock Town where
  the slide is to get to East Clock Town.

  In East Clock Town, go directly ahead and talk to the kid guarding the alley
  way. Tell him the code to gain access to the Bombers' Hideout (Astral
  Observatory). Once inside, follow the path up to where the water starts. When
  you get to the water, hop from platform to platform until you get to an edge
  where there is a very long platform hugging the wall. Slowly creep forward
  and when a Giant Skulltulla plops down, Z-Target it. When it turns around,
  exposing its belly, hit it quickly with a bubble. Yay! You just had your
  first battle...and won! Collect whatever it leaves behind and make a right
  taking you into another corridor.

  Go forward, pop the Majora's Mask balloon and climb the ladder. If you are
  low on Magic Power or health, break some pots to get a few refills. Then, if
  you have not already done so, climb the ladder. Embark forward into darkness,
  which will then change into a joyful scene of happy music. Ignore the stairs
  and head up the colorful stairs.

  Talk to the Astronomer to learn a bit about the Skull Kid. Then agree to look
  in the telescope. Zoom in on the top of the Clock Tower to view a cut scene
  that reveals a Moon's Tear and a bit of mockery by the Skull Kid. When you
  are done, walk outside, grab the Moon's tear, then go back inside. Head down
  the stairs and talk to the Scarecrow. Agree to dance and keep dancing over
  and over until the Night of the 3rd Day. Retrace your steps out and exit the
  Observatory. After you've exited the it, head back to South Clock Town.

  Once you are in South Clock Town, head near the pond where the ramp starts on
  the left. Notice the Deku Flower there. When you try to use it, you get
  yelled at by Scrub claiming it is his. Talk to the Deku Scrub and give him
  your Moon's Tear in exchange for his Deku Flower. After the exchange is
  complete, he'll fly off. Test out the Deku Flower or do whatever you want
  until Midnight of the 3rd Day. Also, notice the rumbles in the ground. Could
  those be signs of the moon crashing down? Who knows...just make sure your
  ready to use that Deku Flower at Midnight.

  At the stroke of Midnight, the carnival will begin but to spoil things, the
  Moon will start coming down. There is only 5 minutes left! Hurry up and do
  what I say fast. First use the Deku Flower to get onto the platform in front
  of the entrance to the Clock Tower. Collect the Piece of Heart and get ready
  for battle. Quickly now, head up the stairs and onto the top of the Clock
  Tower. After a small cutscene, the Skull Kid will scream and command the Moon
  to hit Termina! Quickly hit the Skull Kid with a bubble, freezing him, and
  causing him to drop the Ocarina. Grab the Ocarina to be launched into a
  flashback.

  In the flashback, you will learn about Zelda and how to play the Song of
  Time. When Tatl wakes you from your memory, equip the Ocarina of Time to any
  C-Button and play the Song of Time. Hit yes to the option of "Save and return
  to the Dawn of the First Day". You will fall through an abyss of time losing
  all perishable items like Rupees but your game will have saved and you will
  be back in South Clocktown with a bucketful of memories.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  The title of this section says it all. We are going back to being Hylian!
  After Tatl blabbers a bit about how weird it is being back to the first day,
  head into the lower Clock Tower entrance. Talk to the Happy Mask Salesman and
  watch him get over eccentric about you getting your Ocarina back. He will
  teach you the Song of Healing. When you play it for the first time, you will
  experience a change inside. You will start changing and then the Deku Mask
  will fall at your feet. The Happy Mask Salesman will explain that the Song of
  Healing dimishes evil and heals troubled spirits, turning them into masks.
  That just happened to you. Now for the hard part (for the Happy Mask Salesman
  that is). He'll ask for Majora's Mask...but the problem is you don't have it.
  He'll talk about what an evil mask it is and its history and then will ask
  you to retrieve it for him after going all evil-eyed. With confidence in your
  normal body, draw your sword, cock your shield and go back into Termina as a
  whole new person.

  As you exit and Tatl tells you about going to the swamp, mountains, ocean,
  and the canyon, just pause and try to remember what the Great Fairy said. Oh,
  and by the way, before we head to our first real dungeon, will be pulling off
  some side quests just to get a bit more prepared. She said come back in your
  normal form for some additional help. So, go to North Clock Town and then go
  into her shrine. As you enter the shrine, it seems that the Fairy isn't whole
  anymore. This is caused by the fact that you warped back in time, therefore
  resetting pretty much everything. Head on down to South Clock Town and then
  into the Laundry Pool. Collect the stray fairy the same way you did last time
  and head back to her Shrine. As you enter the pool, the fairies will unite
  and form the Great Fairy. Instead of granting you Magic Power, she will heal
  you and give you the Great Fairy's mask. The Great Fairy Mask causes near by
  Fairies to be attracted to the mask so you can collect them. This is to be by
  all means used in dungeons where shattered Great Fairies are. Also note that
  the hair of the mask will glitter and shimmer when a fairy is near. She also
  tells you to come to her for healing at any time.

  Exit the Great Fairy's Shrine and go back to North Clock Town. It is time to
  become an official member of the Bombers' club. Turn into a Deku Scrub using
  the Deku Mask and pop the Majora's Mask balloon. Agree to take the test of
  finding the Bombers again (you have to do it again because time has reset.
  However, the code hasn't).

  The first one is located just next to a tree near the entrance to South Clock
  Town. Just attack him to "catch" him. The next Bomber is located on the
  direct opposite corner of this area, behind the slide. When you catch him, go
  straight to the dirt road and take the entrance to East Clock Town (it is the
  only other way out besides South Clock Town).

  There are two Bomber Kids in East Clock Town. To get the first one, run up
  the stairs near the area where East Clock Town lowers in elevation. The kid
  up there will jump off the roof with a CuCu. Jump after him and catch him
  when he hits the ground. 3 down and only two more to go. See the treasure
  chest shaped shop on the right side of this town? Dive into the Deku Flower
  just near its entrance. You will notice that there is a straw awning just
  near the Flower also. Use the Deku Flower to get onto the straw awning. The
  Bomber ontop of the awning will immediately jump off when you land, so follow
  him and catch him. Now there is only one left! Use the exit just next to the
  awning to get to South Clock Town.

  From South Clock Town, go directly to the other side of the Clock Tower and
  enter West Clock Town. As you enter, you will notice the last Bomber
  patrolling just a bit away from you. Catch him to pass the test. The Bombers
  will award you with a Bombers' Notebook. The code to the Observatory will be
  automatically added to your Bombers' Notebook.

  Play around with your new notebook and whatnot. Now for a little lesson from
  me. Remember how the scarecrow said something about slowing time down and
  speeding it up with the special instrument? Well the instrument is your
  Ocarina and the special song is the Song of Time. Play the Song of Time
  backwards to slow time down to the point where 3 days is actually 6 days. Now
  don't actually do it now but when you're doing dungeons and such, this is
  essential. Also, play the Song of Time, except play each note twice to skip
  forward half a day. If you don't at all understand what I just said, refer to
  the section in the Appendices entitled "Songs".

  Now, we've got some time until the next side quest happens. Play around or do
  whatever you want until Midnight of the FIRST DAY. At that point, make sure
  you are in North Clock Town near the slide facing the dirt path. Make sure
  you are not in view of the man standing near the corner of the slide area. At
  Midnight, the man, Sakon will rush out and try to rob an old lady who works
  at the Bomb Shop. Stop him by running into him and slashing him and such.
  After the incident is over and if you stopped Sakon from robbing the old lady
  and chase him out, talk to her. The Old Lady from the Bomb Shop will thank
  you and award you with the Blast Mask, a mask that allows you to detonate
  bombs at the cost of your life. However, if you detonate a bomb and your
  quick to put up a shield, you don't always get hurt! You also get an entry to
  your Bombers' Notebook.

  Now, it should be close to 1 or 2AM, so head down to South Clock Town and
  then to the Laundry Pool. As you enter the pool, you'll here music playing.
  Talk to the man sitting on the bench. He will confess to some rubbish about
  stealing a mask from an Animal Troupe and award the mask to you, his guest.
  The mask is called the Bremen Mask and gives you some power over animals when
  playing music with it on. The man, Guru-Guru will be added to your Bombers'
  Notebook.

  Exit the Laundry Pool and head to the ramp on the left side of the Clock
  Tower and notice the "unfinished" Owl Statue. Strike it with your sword for
  it to turn into a completed Owl Statue. An Owl Statue allows for interrupt
  saving to be used. There are Owl Statues all over the game but all have to be
  activated. An interrupt save involves saving your exact position and amount
  of money and items without warping back in time. Note that if you interrupt
  save, re-open your file, and then close it without saving, you will be reset
  to the last time you traveled back to the Dawn of the First Day. Finally, to
  end this section, Save and warp back to the Dawn of the First Day.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Ah, yes! After a bit of side quests/preparations/other crap, we are ready to
  take on our first actual dungeon. However, lots of things have to be done to
  access the dungeon, so brace youself as we are in for a bumpy ride :).

  First thing to do before leaving Clock Town: play the Inverted Song of Time
  and slow time down! You want as much time as you can get. Then, go to West
  Clock Town and grab about 40 Rupees from the bank if you have that much.
  Next, walk up to the guard blocking your way out of South Clock Town in into
  Termina Field. He won't let you go but then he will notice your sword and
  shield and let you go. As you get a brief pictorial overview of Termina Field
  and you gain control of Link, notice the music. If you have played other
  Zelda games you will get all nostlaigic and realize that that is the famous
  Overworld Theme!

  Anyway, getting back to our real mission of saving the world! Draw your sword
  and proceed forward, yes, directly forward. As you get closer to the hollowed
  out log, Z-Target the Green ChuChu, kill it with your sword and collect
  whatever it leaves behind. Also slice up some of the plants for some
  supplies. Be hasty though as there is a bird that homes in on things like you
  and steals their stuff. Continue on forward and the game will change into a
  cutscene about how Tatl and Tael met the Skull Kid as you pass the
  engravement on the big tree at the entrance to another path. Take that path
  to get to a new area.

  Continue forward, killing whatever is in your way be it Green or Red ChuChus.
  Try to stay far from the tree as it is a home to lots of bats. As you come to
  a fork, take the right path, turn into a Deku Scrub and pop the balloon
  Tingle is using to stay up. Buy a map if you please with the money you
  withdrew from the bank. Then continue forward and enter the Southern Swamp.

  As you enter the Southern Swamp, you see what appears to be a disgustingly
  polluted science experiement gone wrong. It isn't. It is just that the Skull
  Kid has poisoned the water to the point where it hurts. Head right to the
  corner of the land before water and activate the Owl Statue there with your
  sword. Then, head left and enter the Tourist Information Center. Talk to the
  husky man on the left and he will talk about the Pictograph contest. He will
  also tell you to enter the contest you need to schedule a boat cruise using
  the window to the right. Walk over to the window, but when you read the sign,
  it seems the ticket office is closed and you need to head over to the Magic
  Hags' Potion Shop. Head outside and if you want, slash up the Mini Baba near
  the Owl Statue possibly for some Deku Sticks.

  Then, head just to the left of the Tourist Information Center. You will
  notice a trail of lily pads heading out across the water. Turn into a Deku
  Scrub and hop on the water to first lily pad. Then hop to the second and so
  on until you reach land again. When you do hit land, you will come to what
  appears to be an "entrance" to the potion shop. Follow the path kill all the
  Deku Baba's in your way. When you get into a clearing, you will notice the
  Potion Shop is in a tree-house like building above some CLEAN water. However,
  do not go in yet. Follow the grassy path until you get to a vast exit. Go
  through it to find a monkey waiting for you. Talk to it and then follow it.
  Try to be quick as if you take a wrong turn you will be reverted back to the
  beginning. Sounds like the Lost Woods re-born to me.

  When you get to a stop, you will notice one of the old hags *coughTWINROVA
  SISTERcough* lying down in pain. Talk to her to find out she needs one of her
  sister's potions. Take any path to exit the Forest of Mystery. Now once you
  are back in the clearing, go into the Potion Shop. Talk to the clerk, the
  other sister to get a Red Potion along with a bottle. Then, head outside and
  re-enter the Woods of Mystery. Follow the monkey again to get to the old hag.
  Give the hag the potion and she will promise you a free boat cruise and fly
  off.

  Exit the Woods of Mystery and then the monkeys will swarm you and surround
  you. Don't worry though, they won't hurt you. Instead, talk to them and they
  will tell of their brother who tried to save the Southern Swamp by going into
  the Deku Temple. But since the temple is for Deku's only, the brother was
  captured and is going to be executed at the Deku Palace. It is time to head
  there!

  Go back to the water lilies and use them to hop back to the Tourist
  Information Center. Head inside and go to the ticket office window and ask
  for a free boat ride. You will get a Pictograph because of the contest. Then
  the boat will leave with you on it. Don't worry about taking a Pictograph
  just yet. That can wait until later. Just enjoy the boat cruise and look
  around. As the boat stops at the Deku Palace, get off. Try not to fall into
  the swamp water unless you have a death wish. As you go forward, the monkey
  will be waiting for you. Follow him into the Deku Palace. Then, quickly
  change into a Deku Scrub and cross the log bride until you get to the
  entrance to the inside of the palace. The gaurds will let you in because you
  are a Deku. Head straight and into the Royal Chamber as they instruct.

  As you enter the King's Chamber, you will notice him dancing wildly as if
  cursing the monkey as well as his followers with him. Get right in front of
  the King and then take the best pictograph of him you can. Then talk to him
  and he will call you low class and other typical stuff that a king would say.
  Then try and talk to the monkey all caged up. Exit back to the hallway to
  talk to the imprisoned monkey's brother. Listen to him carefully and the take
  door on the left (if you are facing the exit of the palace).

  The view will become an overhead view and you it will seem to be that you
  need to infiltrate the Deku Palace gardens without being caught. Let's start
  with this first area. Simply go around when the gaurds aren't looking the
  direction of you. Now, the second area gets a bit harder. From the start,
  make left and go forward and duck behind the boulder near the back. As the
  Deku starts coming on your path, slow circle around the boulder and avoid
  him. Then quickly make a right and duck behind the closest box. Notice the
  hole? Well when a guard isn't looking, drop down it! Go forward and fill your
  empty potion bottle with spring forward. Then go back to the place you game
  down but don't go back up. Instead take the other path up to the bean seller.

  Talk to him to get one free sample! Now you can plant the bean where the
  monkey said! Quickly exit and get purposely caught so you can get outside
  faster. Now that you are out, instead of going back in, look right. You will
  notice a trail of lilly pads leading to the place the monkey was talking
  about. Take the bean and plant it in the patch of light soil. Then dump the
  water over it to form a magic bean plant.

  Next, ride the Magic Bean to the top of the garden. Hop of and slowly go on
  the path. Drop down ever so slightly to a Deku Flower. Next, launch out of
  the Deku Flower and land on the moving platform with a Deku Flower on it. Hit
  the Deku Scrub that is trying to hit you with Deku Nuts with a bubble to kill
  it. Once he is dead, use the current Deku Flower to land on his now purified
  flower. Before you descend, make sure that your shadow is over the flower,
  otherwise you will miss. In fact, always do than when flying. Next, if you
  look just ahead of you, you will see another moving platform in another are.
  Fly over there and land on the moving platform.

  Quickly kill the sniper in front of you and fly over to the dead Deku's Deku
  Flower and use it to get to the platform in the right corner. Walk straight
  ahead until you get to the other side of the gardens. As you walk out into
  the open, kill the next Deku sniper with a bubble and make sure you have some
  magic left. If not head back to the corner platform from the last room and
  bust some pots. Anyway, now use the flower next to you to get to newly killed
  Deku's Flower. From there, go to the moving platform and shoot the nearby
  Deku Scrub. Get to its flower then use that to get to the slightly distant
  moving platform. Now ride the moving platform. As the platform gets higher
  near the end of its loop, fly out of the Deku Flower and onto the platform.
  Walk into the entrace and you'll find yourself in the Monkey's cage.

  Talk to the monkey in your human form. He will ask for a loud instrument.
  Change into a Deku Scrub and bring out your Deku Pipes (your Ocarina). The
  monkey will explain about the poison swamp water and the princess. Agree to
  save the princess. He will then teach you the melody that opens up the
  temple. Play the Sonata of Awakening and you'll get thrown out of the palace.
  As your getting thrown out, the monkey will tell you to use the shortcut.
  However, since we are doing things my way, head back to the Tourist
  Information Center to claim your prize for the picture of the Deku King.
  Anyway, we are going to pull one more vital side quest off before we go
  through our first temple. Head back to Clock Town.

  If you exit through South Clock Town, you will notice that to the right of
  the Southern Swamp is another area, Romani Ranch. As you go in there, you
  will notice that there is a huge boulder blocking the way that will not be
  gone until the 3rd day. So, just stay there and play the Song of Time --
  except play every note twice, and you will skip forward half a day. This is
  called the Song of Double Time. Do this until the Final Day. Finally, the
  rock will be cleared. Now, head back a bit (but don't exit the path) and
  activate the Owl Statue. Then, enter the ranch!

  As you go along the path, turn right at the barn to find Epona...but you
  cannot get her yet so it is best to not talk to the girl. Anyway, continue
  along the path. As it ends, go in the direction of the buiding with the red
  banner on the front. Enter the Cucoo Shack. Head into the grass and talk to
  Grog, the man sitting in front of the tree. Apparently, he wants to see his
  roosters in there prime before they die. Put the Bremen Mask on and start
  marching, the young chicks, when very close to you, will be attracted and
  start forming a line. Once you have them all, keep marching and they will
  eventually into adults! As a reward, he will award you with the Bunny Hood,
  one of my most favored masks. I generally always keep it on as much as
  possible. Why? It literally doubles your speed and jumping ability. You will
  get a notebook entry for Grog.

  Exit the shack and exit the ranch. However, on your way out, make sure to
  talk to Cremia, the little girl near Epona, for the sake of getting another
  entry in your notebook. After that, there isn't much else to do, so save and
  warp back in time to the Dawn of the First Day.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  As the Dawn of the First Day strikes, prepare yourself. First put on your
  Bunny Hood so you will move faster and also play the Inverted Song of Time.
  Then, exit Clock Town and head to the Southern Swamp. Next, head left and use
  the lilies to get to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop.

  You know what to do, head into the woods, follow the monkey, find the hag, go
  back, get the potion, and save her! As expected, she will promise you a free
  boat cruise!

  Head back to the Tourist Information Center and accept your free boat cruise.
  Disembark when you get to the Deku Palace. Follow the monkey and head in.
  Except, this time, don't go into the Deku Palace. Turn into a Deku Scrub and
  use the water lilies to the left. Are we going to the magic bean spot again?
  Nope, instead, after you go 1 lilly out, take the lilly to the right instead
  of heading to the magic bean spot. Use that to get onto a platform, which,
  apparently if you read the sign, leads to Woodfall (via use of the Deku
  Flower). Enter Woodfall!

  Immediately lock onto the dragon fly like creatures and kill them with your
  bubbles. Then use the nearby Deku Flower to get the next mushroom. From
  there, go to the even shorter mushroom at the left. Then, head onto the
  wooden thing. Hop onto the next mushroom from there. Use the Deku Flower
  there to go to the platform to the left of the waterfall with the tombstone
  like object. The infamous Owl from other Zelda games whose name I forgot. He
  will tell you about the Owl Statues and how they are there to aid you. Read
  the tombstone to learn the Song of Soaring. The Song of Soaring allows you to
  warp to any Owl Statue you have activated, at any given time.

  Next, use the Deku Flower to get to the platform to the right of the
  waterfall. Use the doorway to enter the real "Woodfall".

  Poisoned and uninhabitable Woodfall may seem, but that is why you are here.
  To change the face of destiny and the fate of the earth. Hop to the lilly pad
  at the right and onto the wooden walkway. Z-Target the creature and learn
  about it. Shoot it twice with bubbles to completely kill it and head up the
  platform. Kill the next creature and continue on. At the top, kill the Deku
  Scrub. Look sort of down and to the right to see another scrub. Land right
  next to it and kill it. Run up the walkway and kill the next scrub. Use its
  flower to get to the square platform. Turn back into your normal form and
  activate the Owl Statue. Since we want maximum time to beat the temple, warp
  back in time do the Dawn of the First Day!

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Immediately, play the Song of Inverted Time. Then, play the Song of Soaring
  to and warp right to that good old square platform in Woodfall. When you get
  there, get a bottle ready, and use your sword to break all the pots. In one
  of the pots is a fairy. Capture the fairy in a bottle. When you die, it will
  come out and restore you :).

  Now...the moment you have been waiting for! Turn into a Deku Scrub and hop
  onto the small platform with a picture of a Deku Scrub. Now, proceed to play
  the Sonata of Awakening! The Woodfall Temple will rise out of the water! Use
  the Deku Flower near you to get there and enter!

  As you enter, you will be greeted by a dim and vast area that seems quite
  murky. Turn into normal Link, step forward with the Great Fairy Mask on and
  your first Stray Fairy will come to you (1/15). Change back into Deku Link.
  Notice the Deku Flower at the very left of the platform and notice the stand
  alone platform to the right (it's a bit away). Use the flower to get there.
  Open up the chest to get another Stray Fairy (2/15). From there, head to the
  platform directly ahead. Note that if you ever fall, simply run as fast as
  you can back to the beginning of the room and climb the ladder. The running
  is implemented because of the annoying critters often lurking at the bottom.

  Now, use the Deku Flower in front of you to get to the end platform at the
  end of the room. Make SURE you land in the center as two Skulltulas will come
  down. If you want, you may kill them, otherwise, open the door and continue
  on.

  As you enter a new room, Tatl will point out a stench, which, luckily you
  can't smell because you live in the real world. Turn back into your normal
  self and head left, killing the Deku Baba in your way. Walk down the dirt
  path and at the end there will be another Deku Baba. Kill it to get yet
  another Stray Fairy (3/15). Now, observe the large flowers at the right. Turn
  into Deku Link and hop from flower to flower until you get to the opposite
  end. From there, hop on over to the square platform in the right corner.
  Smash all the pots as in one of them will be a Stray Fairy (4/15). Go back to
  the platform that you just came from (the one opposite of the end with the
  Deku Baba) and open the door to continue.

  Turn into Deku Link and then hop onto the Deku Flower floating in the center
  of the room. Use it to access the treasure chest to the left. Grab the Small
  Key from the chest and head back to the Deku Flower. Note that you can't get
  back to the Deku Flower unless you spin attack off the platform to get some
  extra air. Anyway, fly forward to the door opposite of the one you entered.
  The door will shut behind you and you will have to fight a set of Snappers.
  This isn't as hard as it seems. Simply burrow yourself in a Deku Flower near
  a Snapper. When a Snapper comes spinning toward you and passes over the Deku
  Flower, launch out. The speed of the launch, if it makes contact with the
  underside of the Snapper, will kill it. Do this for all three.

  When the Snappers are all dead, a large chest will appear in the puddle of
  water in the room. Open it to get...(drum roll)...the Dungeon Map! The
  Dungeon Map basically shows you all the rooms in the Woodfall Temple if you
  go to the Map Sub-Screen (press start). The blue indicates you have been to
  that room and the flashing indicates where you are. If a room is empty, it
  means you haven't been there. Now notice the engravement on the wall to your
  right. Shoot that with a bubble and out pops a Stray Fairy (5/15). Back track
  out of this room and back into the room with the Deku Flower floating in the
  center. From there, go back to the room with the large flowers.

  Use the large flowers to hop to the other end of the area. Now try and open
  the locked door. It will open only because you have one small key. Continue
  forward into the next room. As you come into the room, change into your
  normal form and put on the Bunny Hood (it will make what you will do in a bit
  easier). Notice the Stray Fairy underneath the wooden walkway, we can't get
  that until we clean the water out. However, MAKE SURE you are in control with
  the Bunny Hood as if you fall you will die very soon...unless you head to the
  staircase near the entrance of this room.

  Push the block forward until it can go no more. Take the right path until
  come to a turn. Turn into a Deku and shoot the beehives above above you
  (there are two - one in front of you and behind you) and grab the Stray Fairy
  that pops out of the very last one (6/15) come to a Skulltulla. Kill it for a
  Stray Fairy (7/15). Keep going along the path until the block is in your way.
  Then push it back into its original position. Go back to where the Skulltulla
  is and light a Deku Stick on fire by holding it in the fire. Run along the
  path to where the block was and then run to the locked door at the right.
  Light the torch holder thing on fire to open the door. Go through the door to
  get into a fight with a set of Dragonflies. Turn into Deku Link and kill them
  with bubbles. A treasure chest will appear and out will come the Compass,
  allowing you to see hidden things in the dungeon.

  Exit the room and then turn back to normal. Grab a Deku Stick, light it on
  fire with the torch in front of you and run up the stairs. At the top light
  the nearby torch on fire and back away and put your Deku Stick away to
  preserve it. Then pull out another one and light it on fire and hop to the
  platform just ahead and then to the one on the right. Next, hop right into
  the cobweb to burn it down.

  Proceed forward to climb some steps into an almost pitch black area. Run
  forward and be carefully and aware. The place is completely infested with
  Black Boes. Once you kill ALL the Black Boes, a treasure chest will appear
  containing another Stray Fairy (8/15). Pull out a Deku Stick and light it
  with the only lit torch. Then circle the outer edge of the area lighting all
  the torches up. If you get them all lit up, a door will unbar it self.
  Procceed through that door into the next room. You will appear to be in a
  large dim room with floating Deku Platforms. Fly to the closest one and kill
  any nearby Dragonfly. Next, fly to the next platform and the corner platform
  and use the stairs to get down to level one.

  Immediately head right and burst the bubble hovering near the edge. Put the
  Great Fairy Mask on to collect another Stray Fairy (9/15). Now go back to the
  entrance you just came from and go straight. Step on the switch to make all
  the ladders "climb able" and go into the door just next to the switch. Head
  right and turn and keep going until you come to a door. Enter the door and be
  prepared.

  You will be pitted against a mini-boss...a Dinofol! He breathes fire and
  wields a nasty looking weapon. Z-Target him and keep your shield up most of
  the time. The best time to strike is right after he does. Sometimes if he
  starts to back up and get into a new position, run away or be ready to dodge.
  He will start spitting fire out at you. After about 4 or so hits, he will die
  and a treasure chest will appear. Inside will the the legendary HERO'S BOW!
  Equip the bow and then exit the area. Now, trace your steps back to the large
  room with the giant flower.

  Stand directly in front of the switch. Take out your Hero's Bow and aim just
  above the torch in front of you so that the arrow will streak over the torch
  and into the metal thing on the huge flower in the center of the room. This
  metal thing will ignite on fire causing the water in the temple to be
  purified and the flower to go very high above! However, we need to get
  something out of the way before we progress any farther. Climb down the now
  usable ladder and SWIM to the other side. Go through the door and hop into
  the water and swim under the wooden walkway. Run into the bubble to pop it
  and grab the Stray Fairy (10/15). Head out, swim to the other side, climb the
  ladder and head to the area where you got Stray Fairy 9.

  You'll notice that near where you found the Stray Fairy is a switch an a
  torch. Use the nearby Deku Flower to land on the switch. Step on the switch
  as a human to generate a treasure chest near the opposite end of the room.
  Hop off onto the platform below (and a bit ahead) of the switch. Run up the
  wooden path and open the chest for another Stray Fairy (11/15). Head back to
  the area with the ladders and climb back up. Go into the door directly ahead
  and hop onto the Deku Flower just floating in the center. Shoot the eye with
  an arrow (it is above the treasure chest) and once the platform raises, fly
  over there and enter the room.

  You will be launched into a mini-boss fight with an evil frog. First you must
  just hit it a lot. Then it will call out a Snapper and start riding it. Turn
  into a Deku and burrow in the flowers and use the technique I taught you
  earlier to kill the Snapper. After you hit the Snapper...instead of being
  killed it will just get knocked over and the frog will go onto the walls and
  ceiling. Hit him with an arrow to knock him down. He will get back on the
  frog and you will have to turn into a Deku and repeat this a couple times.
  When he is killed a small, good frog will appear. Run past him to find a
  small room with a large treasure chest. Open the treasure chest to get the
  BOSS KEY! Now, we are almost there! Backtrack to the room with the giant
  flower.

  If you notice, the shrine that made the water pure again is spinning...you
  need to get on it. Go to the platform in which you used to get Stray Fairy
  #11. Position yourself on the edge of a petal of the flower and get ready to
  shoot through the fire into the torch near the switch that caused Stray Fairy
  #11 to appear in a chest. You will notice a door near where Stray Fairy #9
  was will unlock. Jump off and enter that door! And to think, we are almost
  done with the dungeon and if you are good it is probably still the 1st day!

  As you gain control of Link, pick off as many enemies as you can. Then look
  to the far left to see a Stray Fairy in a bubble. Put on the Great Fairy Mask
  and pop the bubble with an arrow and the Stray Fairy will come right on to
  you (12/15)! Notice the Fairy in a bubble in the fire! Wear the Great Fairy
  Mask and pop the bubble with an arrow and let it come to you (13/15)! Climb
  down and immediately use the Deku Flower to launch to the ledge just right of
  you. Collect the Stray Fairy there (14/15). Now there is a ledge just right
  of you, go, and go to the ledge that is above and left of that and while you
  are there collect the FINAL STRAY FAIRY (15/15)! What a relief!

  Drop down to the ledge before your current one. Shoot the crystal switch in
  front of you to stop the fire and then fly to the Deku Flower that was
  previously lit up. Use that to get to the final platform and then enter the
  boss room!

  Walk forward and music will start to play. Masked Jungle Warrior Odolwa will
  spring down into a battle with you! Keep defensive for now and attack the
  shins when you have the chance! Eventually, when pissed off enough, Odlawa
  will summon lots of bugs. Throw bombs around in random spots and the bugs
  will be attracted to that. Also, sometimes Odlawa will create a ring of fire
  and keep you in it with her. Remain defensive but when it idles, hit it hard!
  Eventually after numerous blows, she will die leaving a heart container
  behind! Pick it up to increase your health copacity! Then, jump into the blue
  auro of light in the center of the room! You will get Odolwa's Remains and
  you'll free the first guardian of the Termina by taking the mask that
  imprisoned the spirit in an evil body. You will then be sent into a
  custscene. You will be on a single platform and the Swamp Gaurdian will talk
  to you in an unintelligible manner but it really means something. You will
  learn a song a song from him..the Oath to Order! You will make out the words
  "Call Us" when he teaches you the song. But for now, forget about it as you
  won't be using it quite yet. You have officially finished the Woodfall Temple
  and now the swamp is lush and pure again!

  When you gain control of Link you'll hear a sound behind you. Slash up the
  debri to find the Deku Princess! After a long bit of talking, catch her in a
  bottle and exit the Woodfall Temple. Now we want to claim our prize for the
  Stray Fairies. Notice the shrine to the right? I'll let you do a bit of work
  by just telling you that the Great Fairy's Shrine can be accessed from the
  square platform where the Owl Statue is. Go into it and claim your prize,
  which I will not spoil (check the SF section for spoilers). Use the newly
  formed path to get out and into a new area. Jump right down and swim onto
  land and enter the Deku Palace. Quickly run forward and change into a Deku.
  Talk to the gaurds and then enter the Royal Chamber. Let the Princess out
  infront of her father. She will "beat" up her father and command the monkey's
  release. She will tell you she has prepared a little surprise in the shrine
  to the left of the palace. Exit the palace and use the water lilies to hop to
  the shrine at the left.

  Put on your Bunny Hood when inside and talk to the Butler. Follow him as he
  goes very fast. If you actually make it on your first try than I appluade you
  as my first time it tok me 3 times. At the end he will mourn a bit about his
  son and then present you with The Mask of Scents. Step into the blue auro to
  be taken out to shrine entrance! Yay! You have official completed the
  Woodfall Temple! You may now warp back in time to the Dawn of the First Day!

  / 03.08 /::/ Journey to the Frozen Hell                                     /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Whee! We are really making progress! As the Dawn of the First Day strikes,
  play the Inverted Song of Time and head to West Clock Town.

  In West Clock Town, go into the Trading Post shop in the long alley way and
  buy some arrows unless you already have some. Then go to the bank and
  withdraw some money (assuming you've been saving). If you don't have money
  head out into the field and kill the bird flying around in the southern area
  of Termina Field for some easy money. Next go into the Bomb Shop and buy a
  Bomb Bag! Yay! We can now blow the crap out of everything!

  Anyway, exit into Termina Field through North Clock Town and stand in front
  of the ice railing. Notice that the entrance to the Mountain Village is
  blocket off by a glob of ice. Look at the large icicle dangling just above
  the blockade of ice. Shoot it a few times with arrows to make it fall and
  bust the glob of ice to pieces. Then run down into the snow and take the path
  up and into the Mountain Village!

  As the snow becomes deeper, the ground seems more slippery and harder to run
  in. Nonetheless, continue forward kill all the Blue Tektites in your way.
  Continue on passing large snowballs and fighting BTs until you come to a
  large barrier of giant snowballs that seems impassable.

  Now you have a choice. You can either use the Blast Mask (hit b and then hit
  shield really fast so you won't take damage) or you can place a bomb we
  bought earlier here! Either way, once the giant snowballs are gone, continue
  forward.

  After a bit of climbing from platform to platform there will be a sign saying
  Mountain Village ahead. Ahead we go then! Follow the path until you drift
  into the Mountain Village!

  The Mountain Village is a seemingly barren wasteland of snow and blistering
  coldness. Head past the bridge and you will notice an OWL STATUE. Activate it
  to enhance your "collection" of warp locations.

  Go behind the cottage and you'll notice a trail leading out. Take that trail
  into a new area with what appears to be frozen water below and two island
  like objects. Use the bridge to cross to each one defeating the White Wolfos
  that lurk around. Finally, you will come to an end bridge that leads you into
  the Goron Village!

  Slide..I mean...walk along the ice, past the gatekeeper, down the wood, until
  you reach that mysterious owl guy! Talk to him and he will tell you of many
  thing but will ultimately tell you to follow him as he flies across this gap!
  How you ask? Well there are invisible platforms and he will drop feathers to
  mark them. Be wary though as they are made of ice and are slippery. His
  feathers also disappear after a while so be careful not to go to slow.

  When you reach the end, he will commend you and ask you to enter the shrine
  to see "the item". Enter the shrine as we shall surely find this item in
  there! As you enter, this is nothing like the annoying Ice Cavern from
  Ocarina of Time. Instead, we have a simple room without ice. A treasure chest
  layeth in the middle. Open it to get the Lens of Truth. The Lens of Truth
  reveals things such as the platforms just outside that are invisible to the
  naked eye! Yay!

  Exit the shrine and turn the Lens of Truth on to reveal the platforms. Use
  these to get back to the "other side". When you get back you will notice a
  shadow hovering. Turn the LoT on to reveal a Goron...or a ghost Goron! He
  will be surprised you can see him and ask you to follow him. Do so!

  Follow him all the way back to the Mountain Village using the Lens of Truth.
  However, if you don't want to waste magic, just follow his shadow but check
  occasionally on him. He will lead you to the other side of a thawed lake and
  will start flying up. Climb the ladder normally invisible to then naked eye
  (remember, the Lens of Truth is the key) and at the top he will be there.

  Note that you should take a good look at the ladder to begin with as some of
  the paths on it don't work. Generally speaking, stick to the right sides
  mostly. When your at the top, follow the ghost into the shrine. He will ask
  you to HEAL his sorrows. That remind you of anything? Of course, you knew all
  along you would have to play the Song of Healing!

  Darmini's sorrowes will be healed and you will receive the Goron mask
  allowing you to turn into a Goron, or Darmini to be exact! Exit Darmini's
  grave and head back to the Goron Village. Turn into Goron Link and walk up to
  the gate keeper and then drop down a level. Hold A and press B to pound the
  ground and open up the area where the Goron's live.

  As you walk in you'll hear a menacing scream that is just soooooooo annoying.
  Follow the path ahead of you up to the red carpet area and enter the room
  where the 'WAAAAAing' is coming from. Exit the shrine and head back to
  Darmini's grave. Turn into Goron Link and pull Darmini's tomb from the back
  to expose lots of hot spring water! Grab a bottle of it and head to the area
  with the Wolfos and the islands. However the water becomes cold fast so use
  the Song of Soaring to get down then use the Bunny Hood to get to that Frozen
  Elder Goron FAST!

  Talk to the Elder Goron a few times to learn the Lullaby Intro. Head back
  into the Goron Shrine where the baby is crying and play it for him. He will
  then teach you the second part to the GORON LULLABY as he stops crying. Now
  he know the Goron Lullaby and we are ready to face the next temple! Warp back
  to the Dawn of the First Day!

  / 03.09 /::/ The Plight of Snowhead                                         /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  'Tis the Dawn of the First Day. Play the Song of Inverted Time and then warp
  to the Owl Statue in the Mountain Village. When you are there, take the path
  to Snowhead, it is directly to the left. Beware that you are in for a big
  challenge.

  Follow the path until you get to a large jump. Now to test your Goron skills!
  Get directly facing the launch ramp and get as far back as possible. Press A
  and start rolling. Due to the little traction the snow has, you will not move
  easily thus making you spin faster and eventually spikes will come out of you
  and you'll be a really fast spinning Goron. When the spikes come out, your
  speed also greatly increases and you should be able to make the jump.

  Once you get to the other side, continue rolling at high speeds, bursting any
  snowball that touches you. Make sure you are ready as another jump is just
  right around the corner. Don't worry though, it is of the same style of the
  previous one.

  Once you have made the jump, continue on rolling (w/ spikes). You'll
  eventually be in Snowhead and you'll see the treacherous looking Snowhead
  Temple. Anyhow, activate the Owl Statue to the left for easy access. Put on
  your Lens of Truth and look at the temple. A humongous Goron (normally
  invisible) will be the apparent source for the high winds. Play the Goron
  Lullaby to sooth it and it will simply fall asleep making an easy path right
  into the temple.

  Once the large Goron is asleep, warily proceed forward on the tiny trail
  until you reach the large slope it was on top of. Back up a bit and use the
  Goron Roll to reach the top. At the top, you will be pitted against two White
  Wolfos. Kill them and take the path to the right...using the Goron Roll of
  course to fend off annoying giant snowballs. You will come to a spot where a
  path leading up to the temple entrance meets the ground. Get onto that little
  path and start rolling. Be careful though as it gets thin and you will often
  go out of control when rolling. If you want to play it safe, walk up but
  press B to punch any snowballs about 2 seconds before they hit you as
  Darmini's punch is slow. When you are at the top, enter the Snowhead Temple!

  As you first enter, run forward and break the glob of ice blocking your way.
  Make sure your Goron Link then push the block in front of you until it falls
  into the ground. Enter the new room and defeat the White Wolfo in your way.
  Then take the only door you can (the right one).

  In the new room you'll notice a broken bridge, a few Freezards, and a Fairy
  or two. Immediately look at the lava below, since your Goron Link, drop down
  (it may hurt you a bit, but not anything that can threathen your life). You
  might land in the lava...that's ok because Gorons are immune to things like
  this. Roll over to the other end of the room where its not lava and change
  into normal form. Pull out your bow and look above. You should see a Stray
  Fairy hovering just under a platform. Burst the bubble and grab it using the
  Great Fairy Mask (1/15). Then get into the far corner and look at the rock
  formation in between the bridges. You should see a second Fairy. Burst the
  bubble and use the GFM to get it (2/15). Then turn into a Goron, roll to the
  other side, climb up the ladder, and walk over to the bridge.

  Back up a little and start rolling. As you roll, you will sprout spikes and
  before you know it, you will have jumped the gap! However, be sure to release
  the A button in air so you don't roll off the platform. Next, turn into a
  Hylian and hop onto the platform in front of you. Then proceed to walk up the
  flight of steps.

  At the top, blow the bomb carrying enemy (forgot its name at the moment ^_^)
  up and open the treasure chest on the left to receive the dungeon map! Take a
  look at it and you'll realize the extent of this temple...its huge! Before
  you leave, look right and you'll notice a Stray Fairy. Collect it (3/15) and
  then head down the steps. Now, jump back to the ice structure and take the
  door to your right.

  Now, after getting a true look at this temple's size by walking in to the
  "main hall", notice that a lot of the doors are covered with ice. However,
  one of these ice covered doors has a torch right next to it. Get near the
  torch and fire an arrow right on through the flames into the ice...thus
  melting the ice and giving you easy access to this room (i.e. the room where
  you fought the Wolfos with the iced door is now melted). Near this door
  should be a door with a gold border...enter it.

  In this room are two Majora blocks and some high platforms. Drag the Majora
  blocks and maneuver them until you reach the very end (the north end of this
  room of course). They will fit into place and a chest will appear. Also, note
  that there is room where the blocks started that has a small key. Grab the
  key and then exit back to the main room. Drop down to the basement level or
  if you don't feel like jumping, there should be a staircase near the door you
  used to get into this room in the first place. Once your at the bottom, as
  Goron Link, wander around the lava pits until you find a switch. Step on the
  switch and a chest will appear. Turn into Hylian Link, put the Great Fairy
  Mask on and open the chest for a Stray Fairy (4/15).

  When you are back on the first floor, go into the door that you previously
  melted open. Ignore the White Wolvo and use your key on the locked door. Once
  inside this new room, kill the White Wolvo you encounter and open up the
  Treasure Chest a bit ahead. You will receive the Compass! Yay! Since you
  can't do anything else in this room yet, head forward and use a bomb to blow
  up the wall at the end of this room. Walk up the stairs to enter a new room.

  Put on the Great Fairy Mask and get out your bow and start blasting icicles
  off the ceiling so your path will be cleared. Once all off the ice has been
  dealt with, hop from platform to platform collecting the rupees. Then blwo up
  the giant snowball to receive a Small Key! Then turn on your lens of truth
  and look at the wall with the "snow curtain". You'll notice that there is a
  chest there behind the normally invisible entrance. Go there and grab the
  Stray Fairy in the chest (5/15). Once you are all done, use the key on the
  locked door in this room.

  You are now in the infamous Goron Switch Room. Quick hop into the snow and
  eliminate all the White Boes. Then get back up and turn into a Goron. Hop
  onto the switch to press it down by pounding it. The switch linking you to
  the other side of the room will go up. Become Hylian and hop onto that
  switch. Next walk onto this opposite side and notice the switch that is
  barely up. Get on it and pound it. This will cause another linking platform
  to rise up. So go and pound down the first linking platform to open the exit,
  get on the second link, and exit this room! If you still don't understand,
  refer to Nemesis' Goron Switch Room picture as its what helped me my first
  time through this room. After you exit, go right back in and put the Great
  Fairy Mask on and look at the ceiling using the Lens of Truth. You'll notice
  a Stray Fairy just waiting to be taken! Shoot the bubble with your Hero's Bow
  and collect the Fairy (6/15).

  Now in the next room, turn into a Goron and roll until spikes come out
  causing you to easily jump the gap. Next notice the snow to the left of the
  iced door and how it leads to another open door! Open that door and you'll be
  on the 2nd floor of the Dungeon Map room. Kill the Freezard and look turn the
  Lens of Truth on to reveal some secret platforms, which lead to a Stray Fairy
  (7/15). Now jump back onto the double block (the one floating in air that is
  wider than the rest) and make a hop for the door you just entered with and go
  in.

  Now go over the the ramp used with the Goron Roll to access different parts
  of this room. Use the Goron Roll to reach the opposite side and enter to be
  pitted up against your first mini-boss of this temple...Wizrobe! This guy is
  really annoying and will constantly haunt you throughout this game. However,
  this first stage of him is easy as cake. There are 4 warp stations and he
  constantly rotates among them leaving for another when you get near. He is
  casting a spell to hit you with so hit him with arrows or your sword whenever
  possible to disrupt him. After a few hits, he will start running around
  really fast. He will then sometimes stop and get into a pitching stance. Run
  really fast as he will hit you with ice if you don't. Continue this until he
  is dead and a treasure chest will appear...hmm...what could it be? You will
  receive FIRE ARROWS! Now you can melt ice! Anyway, exit this room.

  Now, load up your Fire Arrows on your bow for some testing! Oh yes! Now look
  at that door just diagonally to the left that is completely covered in ice.
  Smack it hard with a Fire Arrow and it'll melt just like that! Jump the gap
  using our favorite move the Goron Roll and use the snow to get to the now
  melted door...which is revealed to be a staircase to the next floor! However,
  we aren't going there just yet. Instead, lets either warp to the Snowhead
  Temple Entrance or just hop down so you land on the first floor in the
  "central room".

  When you are in the central room, pull out some Fire Arrows and melt all the
  frozen doors and then head back to the room with the White Wolfo and enter
  the room where you found the Compass. Kill the two White Wolvos and then in
  the corner near the bombable passage use Fire Arrows to melt the ice covering
  a switch. Hit the switch to cause a Treasure Chest to appear. Then melt the
  other two areas covered in ice. Now, grab the block and start pushing it. It
  will slide very far so once you've maneuvered it close enough to the ledge
  with the Treasure Chest, hop on it and jump to the ledge. Open the Treasure
  Chest to get a Stray Fairy (8/15).

  Now push the block to the other end near the bombable passage way. Stand on
  the block and throw a bomb behind the crate or on top of it. The bomb will
  blow causing the crate to explode revealing a Stray Fairy (9/15). Now notice
  the ledge right near you, use the block and Bunny Hood (if necessary) to get
  onto it and then enter the door. You will be in the room with the two blocks
  on top of each other. Jump on top of the blocks and then to the other side.
  Beware of the bewitched pots and then open the chest to get a Stray Fairy
  (10/15). Now drop down and exit back to the central room.

  In the central room, go through the door that leads to the room with the gap
  you first jumped (the one with the Freezards and lava). Kill all three
  Freezards with Fire Arrows and open the chest to find a Small Key! Now head
  back to the central room once again. Then go into the door with a Green
  Border that is next to the double block room. Inside you will be in a room
  with 3 Freezards. Kill them all and a chest will appear. Open it to get a
  Stray Fairy (11/15).

  Now, light up all three torches using Fire Arrows and a door will open. Exit
  this room through that door. You will be in a room with a large switch. Turn
  into a Goron and pound the switch. Holy crap! The central pillar will then
  rise to the very top floor! Go back into the room with lots of ice platforms
  and then exit the way you originally entered this room. Use the red door to
  your right to get to the Compass room...which then you should use to get to
  the second floor. Go through the icicle room and into the Goron Switch.
  However, since you have the Fire Arrows, just melt the ice for a nice snug
  path across this room instead of enduring the hassle of the switches. Anyway,
  exit and you'll be second floor central room.

  Now drop down to the first floor and go into the room right before the
  compass room. However, instead of going to the compass room, go to the room
  with the Freezards and lava. Roll across and then go up to the Dungeon Map
  room. Kill the Bombchu and then Freezard with a Fire Arrow. Next melt the eye
  with a Fire Arrow causing the platform to rise. Use this to hop to the high
  part of this room and then exit. There should now be snow for your use to the
  right. Use the snow to get yourself to the staircase to the third floor.

  Now use the snow to get to a locked door. Now enter the locked door. Put your
  shield up as Eenos will start throwing snowballs at you. Take them out with
  Fire Arrows and then put the Lens of Truth on. Look at the ice marks on the
  wall. You'll see a Stray Fairy bubbled up. Pop the bubble and put on the
  Great Fairy Mask to collect it (12/15). Now if you run over to the opposite
  side, the stairwell to the fourth floor will be frozen. Melt it and then
  continue up.

  Instead of being in the central pillar room, you'll be in a room with two
  Dinafos. Take them on one at a time and once you hit them hop back a few
  steps as they blow fire. Once the first one is dead, collect the Stray Fairy
  it leaves behind (13/15) and then kill the other for another Stray Fairy
  (14/15)! Now exit through the door on the other side. Run across the room to
  the other side and open the door...be prepared because we're facing
  Wizrobe...again =|.

  This battle is just like the old one except there are many more warp stations
  for him. I suggest getting onto the raised platform on the left side of the
  room and then hitting him with Fire Arrows while he casts the spell.
  Eventually he will start running around...just look for the real Wizrobe
  spinning around. Continue hitting him up until he dies. A door will
  open...enter it and get the Boss Key! Yay! We just need to fight the boss
  now! However, before we do this, lets do a little hunting for the last Fairy!
  Go down the stairs and keep going until you reach the second floor. Turn into
  Goron Link and knock the ice out of the platform with a few punches. Head
  back up to the third floor and knock some more ice out. Then use the snow to
  get to another side and knock the remaining piece of ice out. Then go through
  the Eenos room and Dinafols room to get to the top floor. Jump down and turn
  into Darmini. Punch out all the giant snowballs until they reveal a
  staircase...take it as it leads to the top floor!

  Use the Goron Roll to reach the other side...but before we enter...we need to
  grab that last Stray Fairy! Right in front of the boss door is a Deku Flower.
  Use that to launch down to a lower level and then use the Lens of Truth on
  the ice marks to reveal a Stray Fairy! Use the Bunny Hood to then reach it.
  Next, get back up to the very top floor and jump the gap to the boss door and
  ENTER IT!

  You'll start off just in front of an alcove. Make sure your magic supply is
  up as you're sure going to need it. Use a Fire Arrow to melt the coating of
  ice surrounding the boss. The boss, now known as Masked Mechanical Monster
  Goht is a rampaging bull! He will encircle the entire arena. Now there are
  two ways to beat him: the gamer way and the wimp way. If you're a true gamer,
  you'll turn into a Goron and start rolling around the track after him. As
  your spikes hit him, he will fall giving you an opportunity to hit him with a
  couple punches. If you're a wimp, you'll stay in the alcove where he can't
  hurt you can just hit him with Fire Arrows as he passes. If you run out of
  magic, just walk up a few steps smash a pot open and grab some magic! He does
  really crazy stuff after certain amounts of hits such as using laser beams,
  throwing bombs, and dropping rocks. When he is finally dead, collect the
  Heart Container and his remains and pat yourself on the back...you've
  finished the Snowhead Temple!

  When you get Goht's remains, you will once again experience the weird
  creature singing. He'll explain that they are "Guardians". Afterwards, it
  will be Spring once again in the Mountain Village! Whopee! Now we need to
  redeem our Stray Fairy Prize! Soar over to Snowhead and as you start scaling
  the mountain, notice the large cave. Enter the cave and revive the Fairy and
  you'll receive DOUBLE  Magic Power! Now, play the Song of Time and warp back
  to the Dawn of the First Day. Before we go to the next temple, let's get a
  new sword!

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  The name says it all, where getting a new sword, upgrading some stuff, and
  getting masks...lots of masks! This entire section is optional but is VERY
  VERY VERY helpful and my walkthrough after this is based upon if this section
  is complete.

  Anyway, let's get started. It is the Dawn of the First Day...so...quickly
  play the Inverted Song of Time to slow things down a bit. Now, before we get
  a new sword, we need to rack up some money in our back account! What you
  don't have a bank account? Simple, head over to West Clock Town and talk to
  the bank teller (he's the guy in the green suit kneeling on the counter).
  He'll stamp you so that you can withdraw/put in money when in any form. Now,
  to get the sword, you first need to forge the Razor Sword, which of course
  costs 100 rupees. But how are you doing to pay for it...you can only hold 99
  rupees? Simple, we are going to get a wallet upgrade.

  Now, to do this, we need to invest 200 rupees in the bank. You can do this
  the hard way by "individually collecting" that much...or you do it the easy
  way. There are many places in Clock Town where you can get loads of
  cash...fast. Star off by going to East Clock Town and then enter the Astral
  Observatory. However, instead of going where you normally go, swim to the
  left, past the Skulltulla, and get into the alcove. Use the Blast Mask to
  blow up the cracked wall revealing a chest with 100 rupees in it! Go deposit
  this in the bank and then go back to East Clock Town.

  Go to the Upper End of East Clock Town and take the stairs up to the roof
  area of the Milk Bar. Put the Bunny Hood on and jump to the next ledge and
  then to the sing of Honey and Darling's shop. Then jump to the top of the
  Bazaar and follow the path to a chest...with 100 rupees inside! Now we just
  need a few more rupees. I recommend just collecting some at random...possibly
  from fighting the Dodongos in Termina Field, the two boxes in East Clock
  Town, or even slashing up bushes. When you have the final two rupees though,
  deposit them into the bank. Since you've saved up at least 200 Rupees, the
  guy will give you an ADULT'S WALLET allowing you to hold up to 200 Rupees.
  Anyway, withdraw 100 and then warp to Snowhead (which is now yet again ice
  and such since you warped back in time).

  You already know how to get into the Temple, so do so, and note WE ARE NOT
  DOING THE ENTIRE TEMPLE ALL OVER AGAIN. As you walk in, you'll be given the
  option to defeat the boss straight on. Do this and Snowhead will be spring
  once again! Anyway, notice the small cottage in the Moutain Village, go
  inside and pay 100 Rupees to have your sword reforged. They will tell you to
  come back tomorrow morning. Now, head to the Goron Village. Enter the shrine
  as Darmini and go into the the upper area and talk to the Elder Goron. She'll
  ask you to enter the Goron Races. Now exit the Goron Shrine and go to the
  back of it. You'll notice an entrance...so...go inside and talk to the Goron
  about Powder Kegs. He'll give you a test...you need to blow up the boulder in
  front of the Goron Racetrack to be Powder Keg certified. Quickly grab the
  Powder Keg and toss it to the top of the hill, roll up, and repeat until your
  out. Then pick it up and then run until you've reached the beginning area of
  the Twin Islands.

  Notice the hill to your right. Toss the Keg up that and roll up and repeat
  until your at the top. Then quickly place it near the boulder and let it
  explode. Now enter to compete in the Goron Races! The races are pretty hard
  but self-explantory. See "Gilded Sword" in the side quests section for a more
  detailed strategy. If you win, you'll get Gold Dust and then warp back to the
  Moutain Village and wait for the Dawn of the Second Day. Enter the cottage
  and get your sword back! Talk to the man once again and he'll ask if you have
  Gold Dust. Give him the Gold Dust and then use the Song of Double Time to
  warp to the next day. Go back and pick up your sword..The Gilded Sword! It
  does 3 times more damage than the Kokiri Sword! Now go back to the place
  where the guy sells Powder Kegs to be Powder Keg certified! Save and warp
  back to the Dawn of the First Day...we need a horse :D!

  Anyway, now that is the first day, play the Song of Inverted Time to slow
  things down and then head over to the Bomb Shop in West Clock Town...you can
  purchase Powder Kegs from there when in Goron form. Anyway, now we need to go
  to Romani Ranch. You should already have activated an Owl Statue on Milk Road
  so warp there and then walk up to the large boulder blocking the way. Now,
  plant a Powder Keg near the bomb and run...then pop it with an arrow if you
  are impatient. Either way the path to Romani Ranch will be cleared! Put on
  the Bunny Hood for speed and run into Romani Ranch. Continue along until you
  come to Epona and the little girl, Romani. Talk to her to learn about "them"
  or the aliens who steal cows XD.

  Romani will ask you to try out for her assistant. Agree and play the
  game...you must pop all the balloons in less than two minutes. If you
  succeed, she'll teach you Epona's Song and Epona will be yours! Yay! Now,
  head out to the Owl Statue on Milk Road since we have some free time. Get on
  Epona and instead of going to Termina Field, take the other path, which leads
  to the Gorman Racetrack. Talk to them while on Epona and pay them 10 Rupees
  to race them. It isn't that hard to beat them. Just make sure you use your
  carrots only when need and try not to go into the mud. Also, at the very end,
  use ALL your carrots to boost ahead of them to the finish line. Your prize
  will be the Garo's Mask! Now, head on over to West Clock Town and enter the
  Trading Post. For 30 Rupees, by a Red Potion. Now, exit to Termina Field
  through East Clock Town and call Epona. Ride her forward and the pre-Ikana
  area. Don't worry about Bombchu hurting you as you can't get hurt while
  riding Epona. Continue forward and jump the two fences by going fast. Now put
  on the Lens of Truth and look at the circle of rocks. You'll see Shiro, a
  Hylian guard is injured. Talk to him and give him some Red Potion. In return,
  he will give you one of the best masks in the game...the Stone Mask! The
  Stone Mask makes you invisible to all enemiesexcept bosses/mini-bosses. Now,
  head on over back to Clock Town and hang around until say Midnight.

  At about Midnight, exit through North Clock Town and go to the edge of the
  field before the large drop to snow is. Now wonder to the left until you find
  a mushroom of snow that is close enough for a jump with the Bunny Hood. You
  should find a man name Kamaro dancing. Talk to him and play the Song of
  Healing for him. You will "heal" him and be rewarded with Kamaro's Mask.

  Quickly now, head on over to the ranch as it is probably almost 2 and the you
  need to be prepares. Note that around the barn there are bushes containing
  arrows. When the operation starts you have two choices. You may play the
  Inverted Song of Time or not. The song makes the aliens move a lot slower as
  well as time. If you don't, which I recommend, you'll get it over very quick.
  In fact, it is quite rare to succeed on your first time. Pulling of this side
  quest took me 3 weeks of trying repeatedly every day just because I didn't
  use the Song of Inverted Time. However, when I did it was easier but it
  seemed like an eternity of firing arrows). Oh yeah, it really helps to have a
  map as you can monitor the aliens as they get near the barn. Only waste your
  arrows picking off those who actually pose a threat. Anyway, you should put
  on the Bunny Hood and basically encircle the barn repeatedly picking off
  aliens as they get near using Z-Targeting. When dawn strikes the alines will
  all disappear and Romani will award you with a new bottle AND milk to go with
  it =D! Now Link can build strong bones ;).

  Now, for part two of this quest! This time though, were helping Cremia and it
  won't be as hard :D. Enter the barn and talk to Cremia. Apparently, she's
  leaving the ranch at 6PM to take milk to Clock Town. Get near the front of
  Romani Ranch and use the Song of Double Time to make it the evening. Head to
  the barn and get on the wagon. Along the way, you'll run into trouble...the
  "thugs" are the Gorman Brothers (you're not supposed to know that). You need
  to keep them from breaking the milk jars. So just continuosly fire arrows at
  them as you have an unlimited supply! In return, once the milk is safely
  delivered, you will get Romani's Mask! Romani's Mask allows you entrance to
  the Milk Bar Latte, in which you can buy Cheatu Romani, which of course gives
  you unlimited magic! Now go to East Clock Town. As 10PM strikes, enter the
  Milk Bar Latte and go down the stairs! Get a good feel for what the Milk Bar
  is like and then save and warp back in time!

  / 03.11 /::/ Great Tales of the Sea                                         /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Finally! We are going to tackle the next temple. Play the Inverted Song of
  Time and exit out of West Clock Town into Termina Field. Immediately call
  Epona and head straight ahead and twist and turn your way until you get to
  the sand. Well, actually you can just go straight down. Boost your speed up
  and jump the  high fence and continue forward and enter the Great Bay Coast!
  Continue on Epona up to the shoreline and get off. Move to the left some and
  Tatl will tell you that the sea gulls are circling something. Swim out to
  find out it is a Zora! Grab him from behind and push him out to shore. He
  will then walk a few steps and then collapse. Run up to him and talk to him.
  He'll say he's Mikau, guitarist in the Zora band. He'll play a tune
  explaining what is happening. Play the Song of Healing to put his soul to a
  peaceful rest. You will then receive a mask with his soul in it! You now have
  the Zora Mask, which contains the spirit of Mikau! Transform into Mikau and
  test out your new powers. You can swim really fast, dive, use boomerangs,
  electric shields, and even do Kung Fu! Anyway, just behind you should be a
  Fisherman's Hut. Enter it.

  Inside, talk to the man to find out fishing hasn't been going to well and
  you'll also see a Sea Horse trapped. The man will give it to you IF you get
  him a pictograph of a Gerudo Guard...stupid pervert. Anyway, before we get
  the goods needed to release the Sea Horse, we should head on over to the Zora
  Hall. See the "exit" to the left of the Fisherman's Hut? Go into the exit and
  look out into the sea. The Zora Hall is that large rock formation in the
  shape of a mermaid's tail. Swim over there using your Zora super-swimming
  powers XD. Anyway, dive down, kill the Like-Like and enter the Zora Hall.
  Since your Mikau, you can pretty much go anywhere and do anything. Continue
  forward until you find a Zora blocking a door. Talk to him and he'll tell you
  the band leader is expecting him. Continue on until you reach a door with
  what looks like a mini-reef above it. Enter and talk to Japas, the band
  leader. You will probably learn a bit about Mikau and the eggs. Now we need
  to see this Lulu character. For those who have played OoT, the layout of this
  place will seem familiar. Anyway, head back a bit and you'll notice two
  pathways with a door in the center. Take the left pathway to find Lulu and an
  Owl Statue. Activate the Owl Statue. Now Lulu won't crack so just go back
  into the Zora Hall. Now exit and return to the Zora Cape and from there, exit
  back to the Great Bay with the Fisherman's Hut.

  Get into the water and start swimming east. Dive to the bottom floor and
  continue past the rocks until you reach one of those crossbone skull things.
  Break it by swimming into it and enter the Pirate's Cove. Quickly turn into
  normal Link and put on the Stone Mask to make this really easy as the gaurds
  won't be able to see you! Jump into the water and hitch a ride on one of the
  boats to the north western ramp. Unless of course you want to swim...but
  there are evil fish that attack you in the lake. Go up to the top of the
  ramp, turn into a Goron and pound the switch. You'll open some under water
  doors. Jump into the water and turn into a Zora and dive down. Enter the
  doors to be in a small corridor. Continue forward until you reach some wire
  blocking your way. Push the block in front of you until you can enter the
  next wire "sector". However, don't continue. Instead, look left and break the
  skull & crossbone things for form a path way leading to another block. Push
  this block out of the way. Now swim until you find a strong current motioning
  upward. Swim around this. Continue forward past any current you may find.
  Eventually, you'll come to a dead end. Float up and enter the door!

  Now continue forward swimming around the spikes as they are rigged with
  explosives. Take the ramp up and go to the top of this room. Smash the
  barrels in the upper left corner to find a switch as a Goron. Then turn into
  a Hylian, put the Bunny Hood on and step on the switch. Run down the steps
  and into the mini dungeon to get a Piece of Heart. Step on the switch to get
  out. Then go back up the stairs and hit the Cyrstal Switch to open the exit
  for this room. Run down and swim through. Avoid the spikes and continue
  forward past the currents. You'll eventually come to flat ground where you
  should put the Stone Mask on and climb the ladder.

  Step on the switch and then run to the drain, hit the Crystal Switch with an
  arrow and you'll be transported up. Hop to the ground and climb the ladder to
  the top. Look through the telescope. Now use your fins as Zora Link to
  destroy some of the mines in your way. Then look forward and use your fins or
  some arrows to activate the switch just ahead of you. Drop down and enter the
  door to be back on the second floor of the lake area. Follow the path and
  enter the heart of the Fortress. Of course, since the Pirates can't see you
  waltz up to one and take a close up shot of her with your Pictograph box. The
  climb the ladder in the center and cross the bridge. Enter the door ahead of
  you. You'll eaves drop on a small conversation clueing you in a bit more
  about what's going on. Now take out your quiver and shoot the bees nest on
  the ceiling in the room where the Pirates were. The bees will completely
  chase them out. Now, exit back to the bridge and walk forward a few steps so
  your right in front of the door you just came out of. Then drop down to the
  left and enter the door. Run forward and you'll realize you're in the room
  you just saw. Open the Treasure Chest to get the Hookshot!

  Arm the Hookshot and an Empty Bottle and climb up to the top of the tank
  where an egg lies. However, there isn't a ladder!?! Hookshot the plank of
  wood above the tank and if you aim correctly, you'll fall near the edge of
  the water. Turn into Zora Link and jump into the water. Sink down and put the
  egg in a bottle. Then get out of that tank, turn back to normal, and put your
  Stone Mask back on. Now go back out to the central area of this fortress (I
  refered to it as the "heart of the fortress" previously).

  w00t! We just need to find 3 more eggs and we can bust this place. But wait,
  we don't have 4 bottles! That is quite average and to put you up for a
  challenge I did this. We will collect 3 deliver them and come back for the
  last. However, we won't have to do as much work and we'll be able to come
  back to the "heart of the fortress" w/o any effort since we have the
  Hookshot. Now, let's get on the trail of those eggs! Notice how there are a
  lot of Hookshot targets. We'll start with the one directly left of the
  bridge. Hop down and go near the target to get up. Stand on the target to get
  to another and then an empty door (you know where its black and there's not
  really a door). Once inside, continue along and find a real door...enter it.

  You'll be pitted up against the head Pirate who can see you with your mask
  apparently. It is a simple battle. I won't explain much but if you actually
  need help, go to the Bosses/Mini Bosses section. Once she has been defeated
  (note defeated, not killed =\), go through the door near the torches. You'll
  see an egg in a tank. Same drill, use the rafter plank to get near the edge
  and then use your Hookshot to kill all the enemies. Turn into Zora Link and
  dive down. Catch the egg in a bottle and open up the chest for some money.
  Then exit until you get back to the heart of the Pirate's Fortress.

  Now there should be another obvious area with Hookshot targest directly on
  the opposite side of where you are. Go there and enter the door (using the
  Hookshot targets). You'll be in a room where normally you'd have to stealthy
  but since you have the Stone Mask, run right on through and you'll find
  another door. Enter this door.

  Once again, you'll be pitted up against one of the head Pirates. Just slash
  her right when she opens up to slash you and you'll be set after 3 hits with
  the Gilded Sword. Now, enter the door near the torches.

  You'll be in a room with yet another egg. It is the last egg before we exit
  and make a second trip. You already know the drill. Get it and then
  convieniently there is an exit in this room! However, just play the Song of
  Soaring and warp to the Zora Hall. From there, swim to the beach the the
  Fisherman's Hut is and then notice the rinky dink looking house out on the
  sea. Go there and activate the Owl Statue, climb up the stairs and enter the
  Marine Research Lab. Talk to the crazy old man and then climb up to the top
  of the large tank. Stand exactly in between the bars and empty out your 3
  eggs into the water. Now head back to the Pirate's Fortress. Continue on and
  hitch a ride ectera until you get to the place where you were a Goron and
  pounded the switch.

  Instead of going through the whole underwater mess again, simply Hookshot
  over to the target and use that to get to the heart of the Pirate Fortress
  again. Now the last egg resides somewhere we've overlooked look left and
  Hookshot too the target. This will seem familiar as we've already used this
  target. Get up to the second target but instead of going through the door
  turn around. You'll see another target directly ahead of you. Then cross the
  cement bridge and enter the door.

  You'll be in a large room with a treasure chest. Don't bother with the
  Treasure Chest unless you direly need 100 Rupees. Go to the other side of the
  room and use the ramp to access another room. Once again, another Pirate
  fight. You already know what to do. When your done, go into the door with the
  torches near it. Finally! The last egg! Now, you know what to do. Kill the
  enemies or you may choose not to, just get the egg and use the exit in this
  room. Use your Ocarina to warp to the Owl Statue in front of the Lab.

  Enter the Marine Research Lab and put the final egg FROM the Pirate's
  Fortress in. Now swim back to shore and enter the Fisherman's Hut. Talk to
  the Sea Horse and give the Fisherman the picture of the female Pirate. Now
  head back to the coast. We are going to Pinnacle Rock...a very ANNOYING part
  of this game. You need exactly 3 bottles.

  Get to the ocean floor of the Great Bay and release the Sea Horse between the
  two pillar like rocks just right of the Marine Research Lab. Enter and the
  Sea Horse will ask you to follow it. Follow it as it will guide you through
  the misty are. You'll come to a point where the Sea Horse will ask you to go
  on alone and kill all the Sea Snakes and get his friend back. Now go in and
  kill the Sea Snakes (EELS) with two blasts of your Electric Shield when they
  come out of their holes. Go into their holes and find the three remaining
  eggs and then reunite the two Sea Horses for a Piece of Heart. Anyway, get
  out of here and get back to the Marine Research Lab.

  Once inside, put the last eggs in and you'll notice they formed a pattern.
  The eggs will hatch into tadpoles and line up like music notes! Turn into
  Mikau and pull out your guitar! Play the tune and you'll learn the New Wave
  Bossa Nova! The old man will tell you to play the song for Lulu. Warp to the
  Zora Cape and play it for her! You'll awaken a turtle from sleep that can
  guide you to the Great Bay Temple and you'll also get Lulu's voice back!
  However, we don't have enough time left or the supplies needed to undertake
  the next temple, so let's warp back in time to the Dawn of the First Day
  (don't worry, you won't have to find the eggs again since you already know
  the song) and make some small preparations.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  We are going through this game effienctly and fast! First of all, play the
  Inverted Song of Time as always. Now, as you may have noticed, with my help
  it only takes about a day to day and a half to finish a dungeon...which is
  why were going to stock up on supplies until about 10PM of the First Day.
  Anyway, let's start off with our general supplies such as your Quiver and
  Bomb Bag. Exit to Termina Field and take Epona for a spin riding around into
  bushes and enemies collecting supplies. If you want to buy supplies (why
  though?), fight the Dodongos ON Epona for easy money as all you have to do is
  run into their tail and keep pushing and pushing. Epona's power is so great
  she will push the Dodongo and continuously do damage until it dies, leaving
  behind 50 Rupees. Anyhow, try and save up at least 200 Rupees by 10PM.
  However, before attending your time to the Rupees, let's get some Fairies as
  they will REALLY come in handy.

  The quick and easy way to get Fairies is to use Owl Statues. Just warp to
  one, slash up the pots near it and grab the Fairy. Just warp repeatedly to
  different statues to get more Fairies until your 3 bottles are completely
  filled, which should be enough for this annoying but extremely fun temple!
  Now once your done stocking up and your waiting until 10PM for what I want
  you to do. Now, until then you can hang around and play mini-games and such
  and maybe collect a few Heart Pieces. Anyway, once the 10PM deadline comes,
  put on the Romani Mask and enter the Milk Bar.

  Quickly head down the steps and purchase a Cheatu Romani. Drink it and you'll
  have unlimited magic power until you warp back in time! Now, use the Song of
  Soaring to warp on over to the Zora Cape. Since you already know the New Wave
  Bossa Nova, simply play the song to get Lulu her voice back and make the
  turtle arise! Hookshot onto one of the palm trees on his back to get
  transported to the Great Bay Temple. The Female Pirates will try to beat you
  but the succulent cloud will encompass them and throw them out! Once your in
  this damp, and obviously very wet area you'll wave goodbye to the turtle. Let
  the fun begin!

  First things first, equip your fire arrows and light up all the torches. A
  chest will appear containing a Stray Fairy (1/15). Now go through the door to
  enter to start the real temple!

  You'll be startled by the large waterwheel, which pretty much keeps the
  temple working. Now, quickly dive down to the floor and go under the platform
  you were previously standing to find another Stray Fairy. Collect it and then
  get back up (2/15). Now, look left and up. You'll notice 1 Skulltulla hanging
  from the ceiling. Put on the Great Fairy Mask and pick it off with an arrow.
  A Stray Fairy will then come to you (3/15). Now, for some real action. Go to
  the north western corner of this room and sink down. You'll notice a switch.
  Pull/push it until you here that "you've-done-it" type sound that is ring
  like. You'll start up a mini geyser. Now use the elevators near the entrance
  to this room to get to the platform with two Skulltullas. Use this to cross
  across the geyser and to the next platform. From there, follow the path into
  a new room.

  In this new room, our slow companion Navi will realize that the water wheel
  is powering the place. Now, notice the two blades swiveling around in
  circles. Look to the left to see a barrel isolated from the rest of the room,
  accessible only by a ladder. Get over there and smash the barrel as a Goron
  to get a Stray Fairy (4/15). Now, as Zora Link, dive down to the bottom of
  this room and smash the pot. Rise to the top of the room and put on the Great
  Fairy Mask and the Stray Fairy in the pot will come to you (5/15)! Now dive
  onto the surface of the water and look for a corridor with some green and red
  pipes going in on the right side of the room. Go through the corridor.

  You should end up in a room with some fishy critters and a few platforms. Get
  onto the one near the end with the pots and then use your Hookshot to get
  over to the Treasure Chest. Open it to get a Dungeon Map! Now, were the Great
  Fairy Mask. Use some arrows or your Hookshot to bust open the pots directly
  in front of you for a Stray Fairy (6/15). Now dive down to the bottom and
  enter the corridor two Dexihands are blocking.

  You should end up in a room with four annoying Bio Deku Babas. Anyway, kill
  them all and a Treasure Chest will appear. Use the lilly pads they were on to
  reach the chest and get a Stray Fairy (7/15). Now enter the door at the end
  of this room. You'll be in a room with a lot of stuff. First, get rid of the
  Bio Deku Baba and then shoot the Bombchu or whatever it is called with an
  arrow. Then use the lilly pads to reach a Treasure Chest containing the
  Compass. Now dive down to the bottom of the large pool. Use your Electric
  Shield to kill the enemies down there and open the chest for a Small Key.
  Then surface back up to the top and climb onto firm ground. Now, face the
  entrance and look left. Bust open the pot at the bottom of the small pit. Put
  on the Great Fairy Mask to claim the Stray Fairy (8/15). Since there isn't
  anything to do, jump into the pit near the door to end up back in the room
  with the large spinning blades.

  Now sink to the very bottom and enter the purely red corridor. You'll emerge
  and then you should use the pipes to get onto a high platformwith a chained
  up door. Using your Small Key, enter the door. You'll be in a room with two
  enemies and lots of pots. This is a "stocking up" room as your about to enter
  a mini-boss fight. When you are ready, enter for a menacing fight.


  I hate this mini boss a lot. His name is Eyegore. Basically, he has dozens
  upon dozens of eyes. Since we have unlimited magic, this will be easy by in a
  way long. Start off by picking off the eyes around his big eye with Fire
  Arrows. When he opens his big eye, hit him with a Fire Arrow. Eventually,
  once all the eyes have been knocked off him (not killed, just knocked off
  him) he will start charging around the room. Simply pick off his mini eyes
  that are in your way with Fire Arrows (hit them in clusters) and then stand
  in a corner as he  charges at you. He won't be able to hit you and you can
  Hookshot his eye or fire Fire Arrows at it until he explodes. You will then
  open the Treasure Chest to get the Ice Arrows!

  Stock back up in the previous room where you stocked up earlier and then
  return to the room with the Octorok and the pipes as well as the Bombchu.
  Head over to the corner of the room near the Octork and freeze it with an Ice
  Arrow. Turn into Zora Link and then hop to the ice platform and then onto the
  raise platform. Then, turn the switch causing water to flow through the pipes
  again. Now dive down and exit through the raise corridor (not the red
  corridor) to end up in the big blade room once again. This time though, get
  on the blades and use them to reach the other side where the waterfall is.
  Hit the waterfall with an Ice Arrow to freeze its source of water and then
  climb the ladder. Enter the door.

  In this new room, use the Ice Arrows to create platforms to the water switch.
  Turn the switch and then create ice platforms to the mid left corner of the
  room. From there hookshot to the ceiling and open the Treasure Chest up there
  for a Stray Fairy (9/15). Then exit this room. Now that your back in the
  giant blade room, make your way to the room with the Dungeon Map. Get on a
  platform and Hookshot your way to the Treasure Chest. Then make ice platforms
  to reach the high ledge.

  Go through the door and freeze the ChuChu. Use it as a platform to get to the
  high ledge. Then turn the switch to cause water to flow through the red
  pipes. Now exit out and dive down. Go through the corridor the Dexihands are
  guarding and into the Bio Deku Baba room. Go through the door and into the
  room with the Bombchu and compass. Notice the icicles covering up a frozen
  doorway? Well pick off the icicles and then get over there using ice
  platforms from freezing water with your Ice Arrows. Enter for a mini-boss
  fight.

  You'll get into a fight with that annoying frog from the Woodfall temple!
  Except this time, he's pretty powerful. You'll start with lots of blobs
  flying around the place. Hit him with an Ice Arrow and all the blobs will
  form together into a giant one in the ceiling with him in it. Quickly hit the
  blob with an Ice Arrow to freeze it before it hits you and then jump out of
  the way. It will fall down and break and you'll have a shot at Gekko. Repeat
  this until he is dead. Then go through the door to find the Boss Key in a
  Treasure Chest!

  Exit through the hole in the grating and use the current to reach the room
  with the spinning blades. From there go into the room with the elevators. Get
  to the part where you about to enter the spinning blade room but instead
  Hookshot the target to your upperleft. You'll land on a normally inaccessible
  geiser. Jump to the switch near you and turn it. Then turn the other switch
  in this room. Now, go to the spinning blade room. Now about 3/4 the way to
  the bottom, you'll notice yet another corridor. Take this..past the Dexihands
  and then kill all the Skullfish and surface. Get onto a platform and notice
  the water coming down power the large waterwheels. Freeze the water to stop
  the wheels when you've ridden the elevator to the top. Then make your way to
  the chest in the room just left of the elevator with the Hookshot for another
  Stray Fairy (10/15). The look in the lower east corner. You'll notice another
  chest. Hookshot to it and get the Stray Fairy there (11/15). Then get back up
  and enter the next room.

  Now we are in the pretty much final room of the temple...almost at least.
  Now, this room is based around a see-saws. Now dive into the ditch next to
  the see-saw as Mikau (Zora Link). Smash the barrel by swimming into it for
  another Stray Fairy (12/15)! Now go to the see-saw in the other corner of the
  room. Step on it and melt the ice above its opposite side to press weight
  down, thus, lifting you up. Jump to the see-saw near you and do the same
  thing. Hop onto the platform and turn the switch changing some water
  mechanics once again. Then follow the green pipeline (as Mikau) and climb it
  and such and then drop down into an enclosed area. Hookshot over to the
  Treasure Chest for another Stray Fairy (13/15). Then drop down and look at
  the see-saw that has remained unused. Use that to access the exit out of this
  place! You'll apparently end up on a high platform in the Dungeon Map room.
  Simply use your Hookshot to get to where the Treasure Chest is. Then jump in
  and sink down and let yourself be taken into the spinning blade room.

  Now, at the very bottom, enter the pathway with a green pipe going in. You'll
  come up into a room with a Stray Fairy in a bubble. Be happy as this is the
  last room before Gyorg! Get onto the pipes and use them to get settled in.
  Fire and arrow at the bubble and put on the Great Fairy Mask to get it to
  come to you (14/15). Then sink down and look at this room's exit. Pop the
  bubble there with your boomerangs and get the FINAL STRAY FAIRY (15/15)!
  Whew! Now, get back into Gyorg's room and climb the green pipes until you
  reach a final switch. Turn it to activate a mini geiser in front of you. Use
  that to reach Gyorg's room!

  Gyorg, quite frankly, and simply put, is the TOUGHEST boss in this gain, in
  my opinion even harder than Majora's Mask (that's because you will have FD by
  then...). Anyway, onto the strategy on this insanely difficult boss. Firstly,
  make sure you have at least one Fairy as you will need it. Now there are two
  ways of doing this. First you can hop into the water and hit him with your
  boomerangs to stun him and then use your Electrical Shield on him to do
  damage. Now, a much easier way to beat him is to fire Fire Arrows down at him
  to stun him, hop in as Zora Link and then use your Electrical Shield. Now, it
  would take to long to climb back up, so you should dolphin jump up (raise the
  controls stick while swimming fast). However, I recommend the harder way
  since we have Cheatu Romani. He has a lot of attacks including chewing you up
  (eeewww). This does a lot of damage. He might also send a school of fishy
  critters (Skullfish) or hit the platform in an attempt to knock you off.
  Anyway, once he is dead, grab the Heart Container and get out of here!

  Watch the cinematics and stuff and do what you want. However, before we end
  this little session of ours, let's get our prize for collecting all of the
  Fairies! Notice the rocks off the beach that leads to the Zora Hall. Follow
  them and hookshot from tree to tree when necessary. Ultimately, you'll reach
  two large boulders. Blow them up and enter the Fairy Fountain. You'll get
  Double Defense as your prize, which, causes enemies to do only 50% as much
  damage! When you are done, save and warp back to the Dawn of the First Day!
  Just one more temple, but we are going to do some more side quests before
  that!

  The above should not be taken literally, our Hero, Link, is not a thief. In
  fact, in this little chapter of our Majora's Mask life, we are going to get
  two more items...legally ;).

  However, before we get another mask, let's tackle the task of getting
  another bottle. Play the Inverted Song of Time and warp to the Great Bay
  Coast. Go to the other beach to the left and then look left once again to
  find another exit. Take that and you'll be led into a very sandy area (duh)
  with a waterfall and some palm trees on really high ledges. This would be too
  easy if I walked you through it, so I'll give you some basic hints. Start on
  the right side and use your Hookshot to latch onto a palm tree. Continue
  doing this from palm tree to palm tree until you reach a very high point.
  Look behind you and you'll see a hollowed out piece of the wall and another
  tree. Hookshot over there and enter. Jump into the water and try to talk to
  the beaver as Mikau. Then dive to the bottom and he'll challenge you to a
  race. Accept and simply follow him through all of the rings. It is quite
  easy. Then his brother will come. Race the brother through 25 more rings at a
  much faster pace to get an Empty Bottle! Then race them both once again to
  get a Piece of Heart!

  Now, it is probably somewhere near nightfall so head back to Clock Town and
  hang around until say 10PM. Then, put on Romani's Mask and enter the Milk
  Bar, Latte. Make sure you in normal form and talk to Toto, the Zora band
  manage of the Indigo-gos. He'll ask you to help out with his performance.
  Agree and get on stage and play the Ocarina as he instructs. Now, turn into a
  Deku and do the same. Then do it as a Goron and finally as a Zora. You'll put
  a tear or two or three in the Gorman Brother's eye. He'll then give you the
  Circus Leader's Mask!

  Ah, that puts an end to this small little section. Now we are ready to tackle
  the next tempe, the Stone Tower temple. However, like all other temples,
  there are side missions that must be tackled before in order to get the
  "entrance key" (songs, items, etc.).


   ________   _________________________________________________________________
  / 03.14 /::/ Ruins of a Barren Wasteland                                    /
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Now, we are heading off to the east to yet again save another area from an
  endless abyss of terror and pain. First of all, as always, play the Inverted
  Song of Time. Now exit into Termina Field and call up Epona. Get on her and
  continue forward. Speed up and jump both fences until you get to the area in
  which you got the Stone Mask. Now look left and you'll see a sign pointing
  out that the Ikana Graveyard is in the direction its pointing. So get off of
  Epona and enter the Ikana Graveyard!

  Now, continue forward past the Keese and then past Dampe, the graveyard
  keeper guy. Now, stand in front of the skeleton and play the Sonata of
  Awakening. It will awake from its slumber and start marching ahead of you.
  Quickly follow it with the Bunny Hood on to make this easy. Fire arrows at
  him and he'll turn around and look for you. You'll have to stop at every
  "point" as there will be mini skeletons trying to hurt you and a fire ring.
  Kill the mini skeletons and the fire will go away. After a few arrows, you'll
  be engaged in combat with him. Hit him with an arrow to stun him and then
  jump attack him. He will sometimes hit you (this is unblockable unless you
  dodge it) or he'll jump up in the air and try to land on you. Either way,
  when he is dead, the fire around a Treasure Chest will be gone. Hookshot over
  to the chest to find the Captain's Hat (it's a mask).

  Now enter the actual graveyard (the part with the tombstones). Use the Song
  of Double Time to make it night. Then, put on the Captain's Hat and walk over
  to the three Stalfos guarding the tombstone (near the tree). Talk to them and
  order them to open the grave. Then hop down after them. You'll then be
  beneath the Ikana Graveyard.

  Hop forward through all the platforms to enter a new room filled with bats.
  You can kill them if you please (you'll get 50 Rupees in a chest). However,
  the main objective is to light up all the torches using Fire Arrows. Once
  that is done, the door will open. Enter the new room.

  If you've played other Zelda games, you'll know who the enemy in front of you
  is. Its an Iron Knuckle...a very powerful and deadly foe. However, its slow,
  which is its weakness. Simply run up and hit it to awaken it. Z-Target it and
  backflip. The basic strategy for winning this battle is to get close,
  backflip or side jump out of the way quickly as he swings his ax and then
  lunge in with a jump attack to hit him while he is recovering from swinging
  his ax. Eventually, you'll knock off his armor and he'll be faster. Just use
  the same method until he is dead. The curtain will rise and you'll meet Flat.
  Flat is a composer that used to make music for the Ikana Royal Family.
  However, his brother Sharp locked him up after selling himself to the devil.
  Flat will tell you to teach his brother a lesson and then he will leave.

  Run forward and Z-Target the stone block to learn the Song of Storms. Then
  backtrack to the start of this temple. Use the beam of light to get back up
  on the surface of the earth.

  Then warp back to the Dawn of the First Day. Play the Inverted Song of Time
  to slow things down a bit and once again, exit through East Clock Town. Call
  Epona up and ride out to the junction where the Ikana Graveyard entrance is.
  Instead of going there though, walk up to the large cliff and talk to the
  man. Put on the Garo's Mask and he'll pull out a tree, which you can latch
  onto using the Hookshot. Do so and at the top, put on the Bunny Hood and
  avoid the boulders and Nejiron enemies. Once your through the little intro
  path, you'll be in a desolate wasteland, Ikana Canyon. Tatl will say that she
  has an odd sense. Make sure the Garo Mask is on and you'll battle a Garo! It
  is a quick easy fight, just like any other enemy. He'll tell you to freeze
  the beasts in the river to cross once you've killed him.

  Run forward and freeze the Octork with your Ice Arrows and use them to cross
  the river. Then look left and you'll notice another tree. Hookshot over to
  that and then look to the opposite side of the canyon. There should be
  another tree. Hookshot over there and look to the edge of the cliff on the
  left and you'll find a final tree. When you get up to the top, activate the
  Owl Statue for easy access. Tatl will once again comment on a sense or her's
  so put on the Garo's Mask and then fight the ninja for a tip. However, you
  don't need these extra terrestrial ingame sources...you've got me XD. Anyway,
  head up near the house and turn left to find a path leading up to the upper
  area of this canyon. Take that and follow the dried up river into a cave.

  Go down into the water and Sharp, Flat's currently evil brother will start
  playing a song after a dialogue sequence that hurts you. Quickly pull out
  your Ocarina and play the Song of Storms. He will turn good and the dried up
  river will flow destroying the mummies patrolling the house. He will ask you
  to also get rid of the source of evil in Ikana by going to the temple. Now,
  exit the cave.

  Walk near the house you'll notice a little girl. As you get closer, she'll
  run into the house. Now, for a little mischief. Plant a bomb right in front
  of her door and quickly duck around her house. Put on the Stone Mask and wait
  for her to come out. Ask she looks around, since she can't see you, sneak
  into the house. Run down the steps and approach the wardrobe at the end of
  the room. A Gibido will then pop out...except this one looks half-human. Play
  the Song of Healing to heal this human. He will reunite with his daughter,
  Pamela, and you'll get the Gibido Mask! Now, exit this house. Now, we need to
  get some stuff that are required for the next mini-dungeon preceeding the
  temple.

  Warp into Clock Town and grab say 100 Rupees (just to be safe). You don't
  have that much? Go to East Clock Town, climb above the Milk Bar, put on the
  Bunny Hood and jump to the first ledge. Jump to the Honey & Darling shop
  sign, and then to the roof of another shop. Follow the path and you'll find a
  chest containing 100 Rupees. Now, warp on over to the Southern Swamp. Go to
  the Tourist Info Center but don't enter. Instead, purchase 5 Magic Beans from
  the guy near you. Turn into a Deku and use the hopping maneuver on the lilly
  pads to reach the island where the old hags have a Potion Shop!

  When you enter to buy a Blue Potion, it appear she doesn't have the
  ingredients. Head out into the Woods of Mystery and follow the monkey until
  you reach the 1st Snapper. Then put on the Mask of Scents and you'll notice a
  bit of purple. Collect it in a bottle (it's a magic mushroom) and take it to
  the old hag. She'll tell you to come back later. So walk outside and back in
  and the potion will be ready. Buy it for 60 Rupees. Be sure not to use it no
  matter what. But wait...since you gave her mushrooms, you'll get it free!
  What a deal...now run outside and hop down and warp back to Clock Town. Make
  sure you are stocked up on basic supplies such as Deku Nuts, Deku Sticks,
  etc. Then head over to Ikana Canyon once again.

  Make sure you are in normal form and then follow the path on the left side of
  the place up until you find the well. Drop down and enter. Make a right and
  put on the Gibido Mask and leave it on for the rest of this mini-dungeon. Now
  give 5 Magic Beans to the Gibido for the door to open. Now go back to the
  first room and go forward instead. Give the Blue Potion to the Gibido and
  continue. Make an immediate left instead of going near the spiked logs. Take
  two bottles out and grab some fish and spring water. Then go back to the room
  that opened up when you gave your Magic Beans out. Go past the Deku Babas and
  talk to the Gibido on the left. Give him your fish to continue. Run forward
  and if you don't have any Deku Nuts, make a right and repeatedy kill the
  enemies there for Deku Nuts. Then head to the previous room. Talk to the
  remaining Gibido and give him your Deku Nuts to enter the room. Run past the
  eye switch when it is not emitting fire. Inside, slice up the weeds to get
  some bugs. Fill up all your remaining bottles with them except leave one
  open. Talk to the Gibido on the left and give him 10 bombs to continue. In
  the next room, you'll fight a Big Poe. Just let it hit your (with your shield
  up of course) and then hit it with a Fire Arrow until it dies. Capture its
  soul in a bottle and leave this room.

  Run back to the room with the fish and grab some. Go forward an please a
  Gibido with fish and you'll be in a room with a Dexihand. When the eye
  switches open, destroy them with Ice Arrows. Then throw a bomb at the
  Dexihand to destroy it. Run forward and grab some Hot Spring Water. Quickly
  run back to the room before the big poe and give it to the remaining Gibido.
  In the next room, there will be a cow and some weeds. Get some milk from the
  cow by playing Epona's Song. You can drink all of it to refill your health,
  then just be sure to get some more. Go back to the beginning of this dungeon
  and use the northern doors until you reach a room with _two_ spiked logs. Go
  past the spikes and give the Gibido some bugs. You'll be in a Fairy Fountain!
  Run into some Faries if you want healing and capture some if you want...but
  you'll have to let them loose sooner or later. If you don't have any bugs,
  get some, and then go to the Gibido in the same room as you, just to the left
  of the Fairy Fountain door. You'll come to a room with a chest containing 50
  Rupees. Note that the chest is invisible and you need the Lens of Truth to
  see it.

  Exit this room and go back the way of the "magic bean" until you find another
  Gibido asking for a big ghost. Give him your Big Poe. You'll be in a room
  with lots of logged spikes...say 4 of them. Turn right and burn down the
  cobweb and get some bugs if your short and then navigate through the spikes.
  Then look right and you'll see one final Gibido asking for something rich in
  calcium. Give him your milk and you'll come to the last room. It appears to
  actually be sanitary. Light up all the torches using Fire Arrows and a
  Treasure Chest will appear behind you. Open it to get the MIRROR SHIELD! Now
  run forward into the light and reflect light using your shield onto the Sun
  Face on the wall. This will generate a ladder. Now, reflect light onto the
  Sun Face on the block. Climb up the ladder and run through to be in the
  Ancient Castle of Ikana!

  Now, there is a quick way into the Castle of Ikana, so you need not worry
  about running through the well anymore. Warp back in time to the Dawn of the
  First Day.

  Play the Inverted Song of Time and slow thing down. Then, head to West Clock
  Town and enter the Bomb Shop. Turn into a Goron and talk to the Goron just
  right of you. Purchase a Powder Keg from him for 50 Rupees. Then turn into
  normal Link and warp on over to Ikana Canyon. Don't worry about the river
  being dried up again. Simply run over to the right side of the dried up river
  bed. Quite a change from our usually left centered activities, eh? Notice how
  the sign says the Castle Gates will never open again. Who cares right? I
  mean, there's a hole right next to it. When you walk in the hole, activate
  the crystal switch and shine light onto the Sun Block to make it disappear.
  Put on the Gibido Mask, make sure you have some arrows, and enter the Ancient
  Castle of Ikana!

  Ignore the dancing ReDeads and hit the eye switches with two Fire Arrows,
  thus unlocking two doors. Start with the door on the left. Enter it and hit
  the crystal switch. As the ceiling goes up, run to the Deku Flower closest to
  the ledge sticking out of the right side. Burrow in it as a Deku Scrub. When
  the ceiling hits, release your self to knock the ceiling back up. Then
  quickly re-burrow and release to fly to the pillar. Turn into your normal
  form and hit the switch on the pillar to open the door. Drop down and enter.
  You'll be in a room with lots of gaps. Use the Deku Flower to fly to the far
  right. Activate the switch as normal Link and turn on the Lens of Truth to
  find a hidden path. Beware of the Skulltulla lurking above though.

  From there, wrap around the pillar and jump back to the start platform. Use
  the Deku Flower to fly over to the far left. Break the pots for some Fairies
  to catch. Then hop into the flower and navigate around the spikes to the
  exit. Once in the next room, pick off the Blue Bubbles and continue up the
  stairs. Go forward and enter the next room.

  Climb onto the ledge and make your way carefully to the dead center and jump
  down onto the platform with the Deku Flower. Use that to fly to another
  platform and then to a switch. Then use the Bunny Hood to jump back. Climb
  back upon the ledge. Drop down the the ground and re-enter the Castle. This
  time, shoot the eye switches with Fire Arrows, but enter the right door
  instead. Battle with the Floormaster and kill its "offspring". Then shine the
  light onto the Sun Block. Make sure the Gibido Mask is on and enter the next
  room. Walk on by the dancing ReDeads and enter the next room. Oh no! Its that
  pesky fool Wizrobe! Battle him once again...its as easy as last time! Just
  hit him up once again while he's casting spells until he pull his whole
  illusion business. Then look for the copy of him that is spinning...that's
  actually the real guy! Hit him until he dies. Your prize? Nothing..except the
  door unlocks.

  Enter the door to continue our journey. Run past the ReDeads and up the
  stairs. Enter the door ahead to be on the roof once again. Take a right after
  proceeding forward a bit and then turn into a Goron. Place the Powder Keg on
  the cracked area of the roof. Let it explode, letting the light into the
  castle! Drop down into the hole. You'll be back in the center room. Shine
  light onto the giant Sun Block to make it go away. Enter the door ahead in
  the new area and be prepared for a harsh battle!

  You'll see the King of Ikana's henchment get ready to attack you. Run away
  from them and light the curtains on Fire with an arrow to reveal some light.
  Then, start attacking the soldiers. When they are down, shine light on them
  to kill them. Finally, you'll get to face the King! For the King, you must do
  the same, except he has many more attacks. His head will pop off and fly at
  you while his body is attacking...a very hard one to dodge, he'll spray weird
  air at you, etc. Continue whacking until he is down and then shine some light
  on him to kill him. You'll see a cutscene where the henchmen are arguing, its
  quite funny, and then the King will say stop. He will explain about the evil
  around here, after someone had opened the gates to the Stone Tower. His name
  is Igos du Ikana. He'll teach you the Elegy of Emptiness to aid you on your
  quest in destroying the root of evil in the Stone Tower! After this, simply
  exit the Ancient Castle of Ikana and save by warping back to the Dawn of the
  First Day! Just one more temple until he hit Majora hard on with all we've
  got :)!

  This has been a great experience writing this so far and I'm sure the game
  has been a great experience for you readers out there. Anyway, let's start
  our FINAL dungeon! Make sure to play the Song of Inverted Time to slow things
  down a bit, giving you a total of 6 Terminian Days to complete this. This is
  a very magic intensive dungeon, so a bit of the way through, I'll tell you to
  warp back to Clock Town (most likely around 10-11PM) to grab a Cheatu Romani
  -- an absolute must if you want to face the boss w/o much frustration.

  To get things rolling, play the Song of Soaring and warp over to Ikana
  Canyon. Get to the middle level and then go past the cave and to a ramp
  leading up to the Stone Tower Temple. Now, the first task in mind is actually
  getting up there. First hop across the stone blocks in front of you until you
  reach the end. Then step on the switch as normal Link and play the Elegy of
  Emptiness to generate a copy of you holding the switch down. Now, look left
  and use your Hookshot to get up to the next platform. While the Beamos isn't
  looking, step on the switch and play the Elegy of Emptiness as a Goron to
  hold that switch down. Then get on top of the Hookshot target and use that to
  Hookshot to the next target. Step on the switch and make a copy of your Zora
  counterpart. Then put on the Bunny Hood and hop across the blocks, which are
  currently, and conviently, lined up as a path. When on the other side, get
  rid of the Keese. Step on the first switch as normal Link and create a copy
  of yourself, thus negating the other copy down below. Then do the same as
  Goron Link and Zora Link for the other switches.

  Once all three switches are down, use your Hookshot to reach the next
  platform. Make another copy of yourself there (it will negate the other one)
  and then Hookshot up to the next platform. Avoid the Beamos and create yet
  another negating copy of yourself. Then get on top of the Hookshot Target and
  Hookshot up to the next platform. Create a copy of your last remaining self
  (since Deku's aren't strong enough to hold down the switches). Put on the
  Bunny Hood and hop on over the platform blocks. Ignore the 3 switches, as I
  now realize there of no use unless coming down. Anyway, use your Hookshot to
  get from platform to platform until you get to a platform with boulders
  coming on either side of the target. Hop in front of the target and look
  across. Just with in reach of your Hookshot will be a target! Hookshot over
  there and then get on the target and aim for the platform just to the left
  and above. On that platform, you'll find an Owl Statue and three switches.
  Activate the Owl Statue to make this place easier to reach. Activate all
  three switches using the Elegy of Emptiness and then cross the blocks and
  enter the Stone Tower Temple!

  First thing you want to do before you truly enter the first room is to pick
  off all the enemies (Dragonflies and the Bombchu). Just use a few arrows and
  that should do the job. Then, keep your quiver out. Notice the eye switch
  just at the end of the room, pretty high up. Shoot that to cause a chest to
  appear. Make sure the Bunny Hood is on and jump from the side to get it. Just
  as a reminder, try to keep the Bunny Hood on so things will be easier. Open
  the chest for a Stray Fairy (1/15). Then, take the door to the left.

  Inside, kill all of the Bombchu's prowling around. Then, create a clone of
  you on all the switches but the one in front of the gate. Note that you are
  to create clones according to the size of the switch (i.e. big switch means
  Goron). Then find a really cracked up wall and blow it up with the Blast Mask
  if you don't have any bombs. Break a crate to find a small crate. Pick this
  up and place it on the last switch. The gate will then open so walk through
  it. Kill the Dragonfly and then notice how some areas look darker then
  others. Walk over to the darker area without weeds growing on it and place a
  bomb on it. Run away and let it explode. Then run through the dark exit in
  this open room. Shine light on the Sun Block to dissapate it. Then kill all
  four of the Armos (the ones behind the Sun Block and in the lava). Just hit
  them with an arrow and then a bomb. Then use Goron Link to access the newly
  revealed chest. However, before we continue. Retrace back to the first two
  non-fightable Armos Statues. Then look left and up. You'll see a Hookshot
  target. Get up there and open the chest for a Stray Fairy (2/15). Now, open
  the Treasure Chest where the Sun Block was (well, behind it) to get the
  Dungeon Map! Then go back up the steps to the first floor.

  Enter the locked door with your key and you'll be in a pretty big room. Put
  on the Zora Mask and dive in the water. Use the dolphin jump technique to get
  up onto the ledge on the opposite side of this room. It is quite difficult,
  in fact it took me an hour (in game time). Then drop down into the water and
  kill the Dexihand. Enter the passageway it was guarding. You'll emerge in a
  huge room. Simply sink to the bottom and kill the enemies. Then step on the
  switch to reveal a chest that is upside down. We will tend to that later on.
  Then emerge to the top of the room and get onto the slim walkway. Get into
  the pool of light and shine light into the mirror. The mirror will charge up
  and then release the light. Quickly run over and reflect the released light
  into the Sun Block to make it go away. Open the Treasure Chest to get the
  Compass! Then go back to the pathway and enter the locked door with your key.

  Turn into a Goron and punch out the blocks in front of you. Put the Stone
  Mask on and then reflect light onto the sun paintings on the wall. After
  getting rid of them all, you'll make a chest appear. Open it to get a Stray
  Fairy (3/15). Use the mirrors then to shine light on the Sun Block on the
  right side of the room. When its gone, you'll find a chest in the room it was
  blocking. Open the chest to get a Stray Fairy (4/15). Then use the mirrors on
  the left side to reflect to each other to the Sun Block. Sound confusing?
  Stand in the pool of light and spray some light over to the first mirror to
  the left. Then from that mirror, send the outgoing light to another mirror
  and then to a Sun Block. Once the passage is clear, go through the door.

  Turn into Deku Link and launch yourself towards the warm current blowing up.
  Use the current to make it to a alcove on the left. Grab the rupees and open
  the chest for a Stray Fairy (5/15). From there, hop back into the current and
  notice the steel beams sticking out in the corner. Land on those and turn in
  the direction of the next current of air. Do such repeatedly until you get to
  a final platform. Then, exit through the door.

  You'll be pitted up against a Garo Master. This guy has flaming swords but is
  real easy to beat. Simply avoid his attacks and stike him when he drops his
  guard and pauses. Eventually, you'll be him and be awarded the LIGHT ARROW!
  Enter the new room (yeah, I know I've already missed a few Stray Fairies, but
  we'll get them later). Kill the annoying charging enemy (remove its mask with
  the Hookshot) and continue through the door. Engage in a battle with an
  Eyegore. To kill it, simply let it attack you but dodge out of the way. When
  its eye turns yellow, hookshot it or send an arrow into it. After he dies,
  open the chest he leaves behind to obtain a Stray Fairy (6/15). Then continue
  through the door. You'll be back in the main room. Retrace your way to the
  room where you did the dolphin jump. Dolphin jump to the other side and use a
  bomb on the crystal switch to activate it. Go back to the other side and then
  use the Light Arrows to make the Sun Block go away. Kill the Beamos and open
  the chest for a Stray Fairy (7/15). Then sink down and enter the giant
  guarded-by-the-Dexihand-room. Get onto the main walkway and shoot the frozen
  eye with a Fire Arrow to activate an upside down chest. We'll once again tend
  to that later. Then trace your way to the room with the currents.

  As a Goron, drop down and pound the switch. The flames around a switch will
  be gone temporarily. This takes timing and practice to pull off. You need to
  roll over to the switch and activate it before the flames come back. Step on
  the switch to make the flames around a chest up above disappear. Then go back
  to the Deku flower and use the warm currents to get to the chest. You'll
  receive a Stray Fairy for your hard work (8/15). Now, use the Song of Soaring
  to reach the temple entrance. Exit and warp over to Clock Town. Buy some
  Cheatu Romani to give you unlimited magic power and then warp back to the
  Stone Tower Temple. Arrange the blocks like you normally would but do not
  enter just yet. Stay on the third block and look down. Fire a Light Arrow at
  the emblem to flip the ENTIRE Stone Tower UPSIDE-DOWN! Now you can enter the
  temple XD!

  Climb up onto one of the sides and shoot a Light Arrow at the sun face on the
  upper wall above where you entered. A chest will appear in front of the face
  with the boss warp pad. Open the Treasure Chest to find a Stray Fairy (9/15).
  Now, head through the right door. Get rid of the Sun Block with a Light Arrow
  and continue forward. Use the currents to fly up and into a passage. Step on
  a switch to reveal a chest. Go back and open up the Treasure Chest to get a
  Small Key. Then drop down and shoot the frozen eye switch. That was kind of
  pointless but oh well. Anyway, use your Deku self to get to another platform
  just below the one you were on. There is a Treasure Chest, which, when opened
  will award you with a Stray Fairy (10/15).

  Then use the current to get up to a high platform on the right side of the
  room. Create a clone of you on the switch and then get to the Treasure Chest.
  Open it up to get another Stray Fairy (11/15). From there, you'll notice one
  final door really high up. Get to that shoot the Sun picture that can be
  found my looking down and out with a Light Arrow to reveal a chest. Use your
  spare Small Key to enter. Inside, flip this room right-side up with a Light
  Arrow. Cross as a Goron and then use a Light Arrow to re-flip it when your at
  the end. Then enter the door.

  You'll be in a really annoying room. The basic idea is to get the block into
  the blue hole. It is quite simple. I'll leave it up to you to figure out how
  so you can't blame me for spoiling the entire game. Anyway, I'll just tell
  you it involves repeatedly flipping the room upside down/right-side up after
  pushing the block certain ways. When your done, go through the newly opened
  up door.

  A final last battle with Wizrobe! That old fool never goes away does he?
  Well, there is a fool proof method for winning this battle easy. Simply go
  into the wired up area in the corner. He can't hurt you unless he uses the
  warp station directly ahead. When he does, peg him with a Light Arrow.
  Eventually, he will die for the last time (hopefully ;)). Hookshot over to
  the chest he leaves behind and open it for a Stray Fairy (12/15). Anyway, now
  continue through the open exit. Use the Deku Flower to get to the otherside
  of this room and then continue to the next room.

  Take the door to your immediate right and jump to the platform where the
  Death Armos is. Well, before you jump, disable it with a Light Arrow to the
  chest. Activate the switch and then jump back and go to the previous room.
  Destroy the spiked mines with your Hookshot and use the Deku Flower to reach
  the other side via the "halfway house" that is in the middle (its where the
  spiked mines used to be). Once your on the other side, enter the door.

  You'll then engage in a battle with Gomess. To kill him, simply use a Light
  Arrow to make the bats around him fly around and then strike him. Then run
  away as he tries to hit you and repeat. When you beat him, go through the
  unlocked door to get the Boss Key! Now, use the Song of Soaring to return to
  the temple entrance. Trace yourself back to the room with the poes. Now
  before you get out of this room. Look right and you'll notice a Death Armos
  patrolling around. Use the Deku Flower to reach that area. Find a switch in
  there (I recommend keeping the Stone Mask on) and then grab the Small Key.
  Warp to the temple entrance using the Song of Soaring. Go outside, flip the
  temple again and then go back inside.

  Go forward and kill all the enemies. Drop down into the hole and open the
  Treasure Chest to get another Stray Fairy (13/15). Then, go to the really
  large room and open a Treasure Chest to get another Stray Fairy (14/15). Now
  there is one final Fairy to find before you have successfully collected every
  Stray Fairy in the game. Since I'm evil, I won't tell you where it is. Just
  refer to a Stray Fair guide or something (or my appendices =P). Anyway, exit
  the temple and flip it upside down again and then enter it. Go forward and
  use your Hookshot on the chest on the very highest ceiling. Go forward and
  enter the door with your last Small Key. Kill the extra-powerful Eyegore and
  open the Treasure Chest to receive the GIANT'S MASK! This mask will make you
  huge and can only be used against this temple's boss. Continue forward
  through the door. Hit the Crystal Switch to reveal a chest (could this be the
  last Stray Fairy ;P). Since its upside down, Hookshot it to get to the top,
  then Hookshot the target and then drop down and enter the boss room! Drop
  down to fight the boss!

  You will be fighting against Giant Masked Insect, Twinmold! Put on the
  Giant's Mask to become his size! This battle is as easy as cake. Simply slice
  the heads of the giant insects until they both die. This will leave a Heart
  Container. Take of the Giant's Mask and leave this place! Watch the cutscene
  with the Guardian and then the one with Ikana being "purified". When your
  done, take your Fairies to the Great Fairy Fountain (it is just by the Gibido
  Dad's house). Your reward will be the Great Fairy Sword! This thing is super
  powerful! It is time for the final battle...of course once we collect all of
  the masks! Warp back to the Dawn of the First Day!

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Ah, the final battle! Good vs. Evil! Well, first we need to get all the
  remaining masks! Visit the Mayor's Office in East Clock Town at 10AM on day
  1. Talk around until you receive Kafei's Mask! Then complete the Kafei and
  Anju sequence to earn the Mask of the Wedded Couple, Postman's Hat or an
  Empty Bottle, and the Keaton Mask. See the Bombers' Notebook section for
  details.

  Then, head on over to the Mountain Village and enter the Goron Shrine. Near
  the large pot, light up all the torches to cause the chandelier thing to
  spin. Go up and roll off the red carpet to break each pot. In one of them
  will be a piece of meat. Take this to the Mountain Village and give it to the
  Goron who is stuck and freezing. He will thank you by giving you the Don Gero
  Mask.

  Now, save and warp back to the Dawn of the First Day. Then soar over to the
  Great Bay Coast. Make sure the Inverted Song of Time is on. Notice how there
  is another house besides the Fisherman's Hut. Go into it. This is the second
  Spider House! Refer to the Side Quests section on how to complete this place.
  If you complete it on the First Day, you will be rewarded the Giant's Wallet,
  allowing you to hold up to 500 Rupees. Before Midnight, save the Old Lady
  from the Bomb Shop from Sakon once again. Then, on the 3rd Night, go to the
  Curiosity Shop and purchase the All-Night Mask for 500 Rupees. Now once again
  warp back to the First Day. This time, refer to the side quests section once
  again on how to complete the Woodfall Spider House. If you complete it, you
  will be awarded the Mask of Truth! Now, hang around until the 3rd and Final
  Day. Congrats! You've collected all the masks. That blank space will soon be
  filled up by a certain mask that we will get on the Moon.

  At 10PM, purchase a Cheatu Romani from the Milk Bar. Drink it and make sure
  you are stocked up on as much stuff as possible. This is the final battle and
  boy is it going to be fun!

  Hang around until the third night and wait for Midnight to come. As Midnight
  comes, enter the Clock Tower (you can walk up the ramp on the side since
  you're a human rather than a Deku). As you get to the top, you'll once again
  be in battle with the Skull Kid. However, this time, play the Oath to Order.
  Watch the very interesting cutscene where the 4 Guardians you helped come and
  stop the Moon from falling down. You'll then go onto the Moon. Apparently,
  Majora has taken over the Skull Kid, which is why he has been acting so
  ignorant. Now, on the Moon, since you were smart (hopefully) and collected
  all masks like I instructed, you'll be playing the 4 kids' dungeons. Run up
  to the tree and talk to the kid wearing the Oldwala Mask and give him the
  amount of masks he wants to enter.

  The first dungeon is very very easy. Simply turn into a Deku. Run forward and
  launch yourself out to the first rotating platform. Then to the second one
  and land on the golden flower. Use this golden flower to get to the left
  corner. Enter the door and then give the kid another mask to win this
  dungeon.

  You'll then be back on the Moon. Now talk to the kid wearing the Goht Mask.
  Give him two masks to play his dumb game. This dungeon is really annoying.
  You need to roll as a Goron until spikes come out and jump the game. Briefly
  release the analog stick and bounce of the treasure chests to jump the next
  gap. Do this repeatedly without stopping until you reach an area with a
  bridge. Stop and run up the bridge. Then get back and start rolling on the
  bridge to the right and jump the gap ahead. Walk through the door and give
  the kid two more masks to finish this dungeon off.

  Once again, you'll be back on the Moon. This time talk to the kid wearing the
  Goht Mask to play his dungeon at the cost of 3 more masks. This is definitely
  an easy dungeon. Turn into Zora Link and start swimming. The water will speed
  up and you simply must go the right direction which is: left, left, right,
  left, left...I think...heh, I may have lost track while I was recording that.
  Anyway, this is quite simple so at the end, give the kid 3 more masks to get
  out of here.

  This time, talk to the Twinmold Child to play his game for 4 masks. This
  dungeon involves actual combat. Enter the next room. Kill the Dinofols (its
  really easy with the Gilded or Great Fairy Sword). Then enter the next room.
  Kill the Garo Master as you always would and Hookshot over to the chest. Open
  it up to get some arrows. Then enter the next room. Go past the gossip stone
  into the next room. Fun! An Iron Knuckle! Use the slash and backflip/dodge
  away technique to get rid of it. Then use the Bombchus it leaves behind to
  blow up on the crack on the wall. The rest is self-explanatory. By now,
  you've gotten the flow of of this dungeon so finish it off with your
  knowledge and then give 4 more masks to the guy to exit.

  On the Moon once again, talk to the Majora Child to get Fierce Diety's Mask!
  This mask makes you super powerful. Then go fight Majora! Once your up
  fighting Majora, put the FD Mask on to make you strong and then start using
  your projectiles to hurt it. Refer to the Bosses Section on how to beat it.
  When your done watch the cutscenes and congratualate yourself! You have
  successfully completed the sixth installment of the Legend of Zelda Series!

  Not good enough to achieve the optimum ending are you? Due to my pity for
  suckers like you, I created this section where you can get a general idea of
  what the different endings are like.


    Optimum Ending
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    First, I should let you in on the stuff that is required for an optimum
    ending:

            • All MASKS -- this includes the Fierce Diety Mask

    That is considered an optimum ending, but to get a "true" optimum ending,
    you should have:

            • ALL MASKS -- this includes the Fierce Diety Mask
            • ALL HEART PIECES
            • ALL UPGRADES -- this includes the Gilded Sword/Wallet Upgrades
            • ALL MINI-GAMES WON
            • EVERY SIDE QUEST COMPLETE -- includes Bomber's Notebook

    The above means pretty much completing every single part of the game 100%.
    I did this on my first time through the game and boy did it take a while to
    pretty much explore every nook and cranny of this game but it was
    definitely worth it. Now, the ending is quite nice. You'll see many scenes
    from the game. You'll also get a bonus scene for every mask you have
    collecting. If you haven't collected a certain mask, you'll just see a
    smooth 3D model of the mask.

  I praise you if you are reading this section before sending me an email
  longer than this FAQ saying your stuck. I've compiled the most comprehensive
  list on the net of all of the most frequently asked question to hit the face
  of the Majora's Mask world. Weird isn't it? I'm not going to insult you for
  reading this section...


    Q:: Is this the last Zelda game to be released?
    A:: No way! The Zelda series has definitely got many more years in it.
    ___________________________________________________________________________

    Q:: How do I complete [insert part of game]!
    A:: Please refer to the walkthrough!
    ___________________________________________________________________________

    Q:: What is the difference between a the many cartridges?
    A:: Ok, first of all, there are three different cartridges. The first being
        the Collector's Edition Gold Cartridge. The second is the Collector's
        Edition Gold Cartridge with Hologram Sticker (the Link sticking out his
        sword on the front of the cartridge moves :D). Finally, there is the
        plain old normal cartridge. There gold cartridges are worth more, but
        other then that, as far as I know, there aren't any other differences
        except for maybe a few bugs.

    Clock Town
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    • On the Final Day, when you get the Deku Flower in South Clock Town by
      exchanging the Moon's Tear, use the uber-nice Deku Flower to launch up to
      the platform in front of the closed exit to the Clock Tower. There should
      be a heart piece just sitting there waiting to be taken.

    • On any given night around Midnight, venture over to the Stock Pot Inn but

  baddies before they kill you, which would happen unless I helped you. I've
  also listed some really adequate strategies and some basic ones that you may
  know and a million others might not. As usual there will be commentary and
  side notes that I feel I must blurt out.

  Want to achieve optimum completion of this game? Then your going to need
  these things that distort your face beyond belief. Yes, unfortunately, there
  are chances you can make Link look uglier than you with these things. These
  "things" are what I call MASKS! Below is a chart listing all the masks in the
  game, how to get them, requirement you need before even attempting acquiring
  them, and just plain information on the masks.


    Transformation Masks
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Deku Mask
    Requirements: Ocarina of Time
    How to Get: In the beginning of the game, you are transformed into a Deku
                Scrub. Once you get the Ocarina of Time back, see the Happy
                Mask Salesman to learn the Song of Healing, which will cure you
                and put the spirit of the Deku into a mask for your ease of
                use.
    Mask Description: The Deku Mask is the very first mask you get in the
                      game. Its soul stolen from the Deku Butler's son.
                      Transform into a Deku using the C-buttons. You inherit
                      a few special abilites when you transform. You can spin
                      attack, blow bubbles, fly using Deku Flowers, and even
                      hop on water. However, you are still susceptible to FIRE
                      and ICE.
    Commentary: I personally am not very fond of the Deku Mask. I do like a few
                of its special abilites but I very much dislike the ability to
                blow bubbles. Sure it is useful in the beginning of the game
                but I find the Hero's Bow to be at least 10 times more accurate
                and doesn't consume magic when using normal arrows. Now
                however, I do like the spin attack. The spin attack allows one
                to attack in a manner where the aim of the attack can be
                manipulated. Also, as an added bonus, the spin attack allows
                you to get an extra edge in hoping on water (combo = Spin
                Attack of something and hopping will be farther and faster).


    Goron Mask
    Requirements: Lens of Truth
    How to Get: After you get the Lens of Truth (see walkthrough for details or
                check the items section) you will notice a shadow not far
                outside the shrine. Put the Lens of Truth on to see a Goron
                Ghost! Talk to it and learn that he is Darmini. Follow him
                through the many obstacles and into his grave where you play
                the Song of Healing to heal his troubled spirit...thus
                encompassing it with a mask that now belongs to you.
    Mask Description: The Goron Mask allows you to become the Goron Hero
                      Darmini, who was tragicly killed when he _tried_ to enter
                      the Snowhead Temple. Transform into Darmini using the C-
                      Buttons. When you transform, you have a few gifts that
                      make you special :). You can pull off insanely cool and
                      powerful (but slow) 3 hit combos that destroy enemies
                      much faster than your sword. You can curl up into a ball
                      and pound the ground or start rolling. If you roll, you
                      will eventually "sprout" spikes and you will kill enemies
                      in your path. Note that as a Goron...you can walk on lava
                      unharmed. There are a few downsides to Darmini's form
                      including you can't swim or fall from high places.
    Commentary: Personally, I think this mask isn't as bad as the Deku Mask but
                it quite frankly isn't the best. Goron Link is great and as the
                roll makes up for his speed. However, he isn't well suited for
                a variety of situations and his shield, like some of the other
                transformation masks, sucks as unlike Hylian Link...you can't
                move around while blocking and Z-Targeting. However, Darmini
                Link is uber-powerful and his roll is just unbelievably
                terrific when you want to jump really big distances or travel
                at lightning fast speeds.

  Pieces of glass that you hold stuff in. Yeah...but are they important? Yes
  they are is my answer. Bottles can keep important potions and fairies that
  could cost you a game over or give you the life to beat a boss that just
  killed you when it was almost dead.


    Bottle #1 - Location: Southern Swamp
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    This is the first bottle you get in the game and it is mandatory towards
    completion. When you get to the area where the Magic Hag Potion Shop is
    located, go into the Woods of Mystery. Follow the monkey to find a downed
    Hag sister (*COUGH*TWINROVASISTERS*COUGH*). Go into the potion shop and
    when you talk to the hag in there, you will automatically tell her. She
    will then give you a bottle and a potion to go with it.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  The Bombers' Notebook is a notebook awarded to you by a bunch of kids that
  solve people's problems. Sure it may sound odd for a complete stranger
  running around trying to fill up a notebook with people's problems but it is
  quite fun and a nice challenge. That being exactly why I created a mini-
  walkthrough for everyone who will go/is in your Bombers' Notebook.

  This was written a couple years ago for an extremely popular Zelda site
  (Zelda Spirits, which is now extinct). I wrote this with my Co-Webmaster,
  Barks who did some parts of this so I thank him where ever he is!


    The Bombers
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Once you have gotten you're Ocarina back and you are in you're human form,
    go and play the hide and seek with the Bomber Kids.  The first kid is
    located just next to a tree near the entrance to South Clock
    Town. Just attack him to "catch" him. The next Bomber is located on the
    direct opposite corner of this area, behind the slide. When you catch him,
    go straight to the dirt road and take the entrance to East Clock Town (it
    is the only other way out besides South Clock Town).

    There are two Bomber Kids in East Clock Town. To get the first one, run up
    the stairs near the area where East Clock Town lowers in elevation. The kid
    up there will jump off the roof with a CuCu. Jump after him and catch him
    when he hits the ground. 3 down and only two more to go. See the treasure
    chest shaped shop on the right side of this town? Dive into the Deku Flower
    just near its entrance. You will notice that there is a straw awning just
    near the Flower also. Use the Deku Flower to get onto the straw awning. The
    Bomber ontop of the awning will immediately jump off when you land, so
    follow him and catch him. Now there is only one left! Use the exit just
    next to the awning to get to South Clock Town.


    Anju & Kafei
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    NOTICE: I HAVE COMBINED ANJU AND KAFEI BECASE THEY MAKE UP ONE QUEST. THIS
    QUEST IS LIKE HELPING EACH ONE OF THEM SO THEY EVENTAULLY REUNITE. THIS
    SEQUENCE IS LONG AND COMPLICATED SO I RECCOMEND YOU'RE ATLEAST PAST THE
    GREAT BAY TEMPLE.

    First, go to the Stock Pot Inn around 1:00PM on Day 1. There, talk to Anju
    wearing the Mask of Kafei (see Madame Aroma on how to get the mask) she
    will then respond with: "You're looking for him too." Then take the mask
    off and talk to her again, she will ask if you have a reservation, answer
    yes. By mistake there will be a reservation that was made by mistake, it's
    really for a Goron who's name is (whatever you're name is)-Goro. Anju will
    mistake you for that. Anyway, after you get a room key, wait till the
    postman comes in. Listen to his conversation with Anju. He will give her a
    letter from Kafei. After he leaves, talk to Anju again with the Mask of
    Kafei and she will ask you to meet her at 11:30PM of Day 1. Then you may
    leave. Till 10:30PM do whatever you want, kill, play games, whatever. At
    around 10:30PM head for the Stock Pot Inn and wait in the kitchen for Anju.
    At around 12:00PM she will be in the kitchen. She will ask you to deliver a
    letter and than meet Kafei. After she finishes talking and you have the
    letter, head for the nearest mail box and deposite the letter. Now do
    whatever you want till 2:30PM of Day 2. At 2:30, head for the Laundry Pool
    and wait there for a while. Eventually, at around 3:00PM the postman will
    come and deliver a message to Kafei. Once Kafei has the letter, follow him
    into the back entrace of the Curiosity Shop. Climb the stairs after him and
    when he comes to a stop, talk to him. He will recognize you from the letter
    he got from Anju. He will then give you the Pendant of Memories, give this
    to Anju at 5:00PM of Day 2. You are now done for the day. Ok, on Day 3, at
    1:00PM, go to the Curiosity Shop (back entrance) and talk to the man. He
    will give you the Keaton Mask and Express Mail for Madame Aroma. I
    reccomend NOT delivering the mail to Mama, because it will jepordize you're
    time at Sakon's Hideout. Anyway, at 5:00PM, warp to Ikana Canyon, and jump
    donw into the river. Climb up and run along the path to Sakon's Hidout.
    When you get there. Hide behind the rocks and talk to Kafie. It is crucial
    that you hide behind the taller rock and that Sakon does not see you. At
    around 7:00PM Sakon will open his hideout and go inside followed by Kafei.
    Run after Kafei and you'll be in Sakon's Hideout. Once inside go through
    the door and Kafei will step on a switch and activate the game you gotta
    play. First step on the switch and then Kafei will go inside the door that
    opens. Now, you will have control over him. Push a block out of the way.
    Remember, the blocks only move the direction the Majora symbol faces. Using
    Kafei step on the blue switch. The door to the opposite room will open. As
    Link, go in there, there will be a Deku Baby Plant, kill it and the door
    will open for Kafei. As Kafei go into the room that just opened. There will
    be lots of switches. Don't step on the red switches that will only
    jepordize you're chance of victory even more. Step on the yellow switches
    to slow down the conveyor belt with the Sun Mask. Then step on the blue
    switch to open up Link's next room. As Link, go to the next room and I
    think you will fight a Wolvo. Kill it as quickly as possible. Then both
    doors will open and as Link or Kafei run and hit the switch before the Sun
    Mask falls into the gap. Now that you have the Sun Mask, head back too
    Clock Town using the warp system. Make sure the Inverted Song of Time is
    OFF. Go to the Stock Pot Inn and enter the Employes Only Room that you
    usually can't go into. There talk to Anju. At around 4:00AM Kafei will come
    in and reunite with Anju. They will combine the Sun and Moon Mask to create
    the Mask of the Wedded Couple. They will give this too you as a token of
    appreciation for all you'ver done for them..! Whew! I hate that sequence
    with my life so nyah now that it is over :).


    Man from the Curiosity Shop
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Well, if you've done the Kafei and Anju thing, you've already recieved the
    Keatons Mask and Express Mail for Madame Aroma. If you delivered the mail
    in person, you would have gotten a bottle and Cheatu Romani. If you gave it
    to the Postman to deliver and followed him all the way there, he would have
    given you the Postman's Hat.

    NOTICE: THE FOLLOWING TASK REQUIRES YOU HAVE THE GIANT'S WALLET!

    Anyway, on Day 1 at Midnight save the Old Lady from the Bomb Shop's Bag of
    Bombs from being stolen by Sakon (refer to Old Lady from the Bomb Shop).
    Then warp to Day 3, make sure you have 500 rupees in you're wallet and go
    to the Curiosity Shop at 10:00PM. He will offer you the All Night Mask for
    500 rupees. Buy it and you're done.


    Old Lady from the Bomb Shop
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Her problems are rather small and have to do with Sakon (Sakon? What's up
    with him...). On Day 1, at midnight she will be in North Clock Town, there
    the Old Lady from the Bomb Shop will come in through the gate with a bag of
    bombs. Sakon will run out and steal the bag of bombs. Chase him around and
    hit the bag with your sword and he will drop it and run. In return the Old
    Lady from the Bomb Shop will give you the Blast Mask. If you want to have
    fun, sometimes if you shoot Sakon with an arrow, the arrow will kill him.


    Romani
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    On Day 1, buy a Powder Keg from the Bomb Shop for 50 rupees. Then go to
    Milk Road and head for Romani Ranch. As you may know, it's blocked off by a
    boulder. Plant the Powder Keg right next to the boulder and RUN! The
    explosion will destroy the boulder. Go inside and go to the barn (North-
    Eastern part of the ranch). Romani will be outside the barn with a bow and
    quiver. Talk to her and she'll ask you to help her defend the ranch from
    "them" at 2:30AM tonight. Answer yes and do all her practices, etc.

    Be at the ranch at 2:00AM you're quiver full, and MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE
    BUNNY HOOD (refer to Grog on this guide). Romani will be out. When 2:30AM
    comes these balls of light will come and drop tons and tons of aliens. Play
    the Song of Inverted Time even though it'll take longer to get to 5:30AM
    the aliens will be extremly slow. Wearing the Bunny Hood, circle the Barn
    shooting any alien that comes near. Be careful, there is one that comes
    from the back of Romani's House. At 5:30AM they will go away. Mission
    Complete. As a reward, Romani will give you a new bottle filled will milk.
    Now are you ready for part II?


    Cremia
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Well, this is part II. After you have protected the ranch from aliens,
    Cremia, will tell you she's going to town at 6:00PM of Day 2 and that you
    can come too. So at 6:00PM be at the barn and Cremia will be there in a
    wagon. Hop on. You will have to take a detour through the Gorman Racetrack.
    Along the way two "bandits", also the Gorman Brothers, will try to break
    all the milk jugs.

    Don't let them do that. You will have unlimited arrows so shoot away and
    keep hitting them till you leave their land. If you have one of those Auto
    controllers (I don't) you can press the auto button then B and it will keep
    firing for you non-stop until you specify it to stop, then all you have to
    do is aim it! Fun! When you arrive in Clock Town, Cremia will say you're
    very mature and give you the Romani's Mask!!! Now you can buy Cheatu
    Romani! Which gives you UNLIMITED MAGIC!!!


    Mayor Dotour
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    At 10:00AM of Day 1, 2, or 3 go to the Mayor's Residence in East Clock
    Town. Enter the room and there will be this huge conversation of people
    yelling stuff at each other. Talk to the Mayor while wearing the Mask of
    the Wedded Couple. That will end the conversation and he will give you a
    piece of heart.


    Madame Aroma
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    First on Day 1, at 10:00AM go to the Mayor's Residence and talk to Madame
    Aroma, she will give you the Mask of Kafei. Then do the whole Kafei and
    Anju thing up till when you get the letter to deliver to Madame Aroma. Go
    deliver the letter to her in person wearing the Mask of Kafei. She is in
    the Milk Bar. When you deliver it to her in person she will give you a new
    bottle and Cheatu Romani!


    Toto and the Gorman
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    On Day 1 or 2 after 10:00PM, go to the Milk Bar and talk to the Zora whose
    name is Toto, he is the manager of the Indigo-Go's. Talk to him in human
    form and he will ask you to play a piece on stage. Then talk to him in
    another form and he will ask you to play a different piece. Do it in all
    form (Zora, Deku, and Goron). The Gorman will be touched by it and give you
    the Circus Leader's Mask. Now all of Toto's and the Gorman's problems are
    solved.


    Postman
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    On Day 1 or 2 at 6:00PM go to the Post Office and play the Postman's
    training game, the best way to win is to use the Bunny Hood, because for
    some reason, the timer stays there the whole time. If you win, you will get
    a piece of heart. Another part of his schedule is when you delivered the
    message to the mail box to be delivered to Kafei, that counted. The final
    thing is on Day 3 at 6:00PM. Instead of delivering the message to Madame
    Aroma by youreself, you could have given it to the Postman and followed him
    all the way to the Milk Bar. What's the point? Well, Madame Aroma will
    command him to flee now that the moon is falling. He will then give his
    Postman's Hat to you. Look inside a mail box and see what happens...

    On Day 1 or 2, before Noon wear the All Night Mask and talk to Anju's
    Grandmother at the Stock Pot Inn. She will tell you a story if you agree.
    First listen to the Carnival story. Since you have the All Night Mask on,

    If you win, they will give you the Garo's Mask. Also, if you haven't
    already, do the Romani and Cremia thing so you can protect the milk, which
    is part of the Gorman Brothers schedule. Its recorded that you helped
    protect the milk from them.

    Anytime, any day, go to the Road to Ikana with a bottle of the Red Potion.
    Under the ledge where the Garo sits there will be a circle of rocks, turn
    on the Lens of Truth and their will be a soldier sitting there. Give him
    the Red Potion and he will heal and give you the Stone Mask.

    On Day 1 or 2 at Midnight, go to the Laundry Pool. There will be a guy
    playing music. Talk to him and after you hear his speech he will give you
    the Bremen Mask.

  I hate to break the bad news to you, but Windows isn't the only things that
  you need to update tremendously without knowing when to. Well, actually
  Windows is still worse but that is a different story. Anyway, there are some
  interesting upgrades that can be acquired that can aid you greatly on your
  quest.

  Think you haven't perfected your warp travel by making sure you cover all of
  Termina? That is what this section is for, to help you find all the Owl
  Statues in the game!


    Clock Town                                                         04.15.01
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    This Owl Statue is the first one you get in the game. It is located just to
    the left of the Clock Tower (if you are facing it). Take the ramp that you
    would normally take to West Clock Town, except don't turn into West Clock
    Town. Instead you will notice the statue right next to you. Slash it with
    your sword to activate it.


    Southern Swamp                                                    04.15.02
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Yet another dandy Owl Statue waiting for you in the first "major" part of
    the game. As you enter the Southern Swamp, notice the Tourist Information
    Center...or known to some as the Boat House. Now look to the right until
    you hit a corner and you'll notice an unfinished Owl Statue. Run up with
    dignity and give a nice hard pat on the back (with your sword of course).

  Bored programmers, horrible programmers, and drunk programmers. What do they
  have in common? They make mistakes or purposely make "mistakes" that are
  small, hard to find, but are cool. This section is dedicated mainly to the
  dozens of glitches, niches, easter eggs, and other fun stuff you can find/do
  in the game!

  Want to kill me? Send me ransom notes? Death threats? Or just plain old
  vulgar emails? Well, if you read the below rules, I might give your email a
  flying chance of being replied to.

  My rule are quite simple. One: your question must be in English. Also, no
  KLEZ or PORN. Thirdly, please use proper grammer and write intelligibly. I
  mean how would you like this guide if it was written like this:

    w00t MiZtA kmOf U waNNna AnsEr mAh QUEstIoNs C'mOn MaAhN! U sUx0Rz b0XrZf00

  You wouldn't like it now wouldn't you. Which quite frankly is why I don't
  like emails like that. Also triple check that your question isn't already
  answered in the guide. If you violate any of the rule, I will just ignore you
  forever. Otherwise, most likely, I will answer your question. If you can
  abide by these terms, drop me a line at the_majical_sponge@hotmail.com

  The following people deserve my greatest thanks and I am forever in their
  debt..PSYKE! FOOLS! WORSHIP ME! Just kidding. I really do oh a great deal of
  thanks to the following people/things for making this FAQ possible:

    CJayC - CJayC runs probably the best video gaming site on the net and he
            hosts all my pitiful guides.
    TNocturne - His Stray Fairy guide helped me out on my first time through
                the game a few years back.
    Me - I get some credit for writing this huge thing don't I? 'Nuff said.

  I've really had a lot of fun making this guide. From the random reader
  insults to mass amount of humor (ok maybe not that good of humor buy hey, I
  tried!) I put into it to the hours spent writing the walkthrough. This has
  been my first major guide and it is my greatest yet. With that, I, Dark
  Phenomenon sign off! Hmm...I think I will go eat a donut now :).
