-VERSION HISTORY-
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the Final Version of the Croco Bombers' Notebook Guide for The Legend of 
Zelda: Majora's Mask, Created 11/15/2000.

Final Version- Created 11/15/00
Finished in two versions. Nice. I'm also surprised that I haven't begun any of 
these commentaries for the updates with the word "well" (those of you that read 
my other FAQs may know about my constant overuse of this at the beginnings of 
these comments). Today's update, as the Final Version, includes info for all the 
characters, as well as a new non-Bombers' Notebook character and some FAQs. 

Version 1.0- Created 11/8/00
Before I begin blabbing about what's here, I'd like to take a moment to say that 
this has been a very enjoyable FAQ to write. Much less stressful than a giant 
Walkthrough and lots of fun. Now, onto what's here. In order to secure a coveted 
Majora's Mask FAQ spot, I've sent this FAQ in a little early, and incomplete. 
Don't worry, because by next update, I plan to have this entirely finished. What 
is complete is Parts 1 and 4. In Part 2, I have the first five characters 
covered, and in Part 3 I have the Clock Town Map, and the first Other Character 
Description. That's all for now. Have fun reading. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE NOTICE: Coverage for all characters in the Bombers' Notebook is here. 
This FAQ is now complete.

WHERE TO GO:
*Part 1: If you don't quite grasp exactly what the Bombers' Notebook is, are 
having trouble figuring out the layout of what I write, or just want to read 
what I have to say about this FAQ, go here. I recommend that everyone reads the 
"How to Read This FAQ's Bombers' Notebook Coverage" area in Section 2, as it may 
give you a few tips on how to read it.
*Part 2: This is where to go to find out what to do to help people out and get 
those Happiness Seals. Thanks to the carefully-planned setup, it can be spoiler-
free, but I suggest reading the "How to Read This FAQ's Bombers' Notebook 
Coverage" area in Part 1, Section 2 to see the best way to read it without 
spoiling. 
*Part 3: By no means do you need to look at this section, but it is helpful. Not 
only is there a map of Clock Town (including characters' locations), but also 
schedules and descriptions of some characters that do not appear in your 
notebook but may be helpful to know about.
*Part 4: This section basically wraps everything up, but there's also info on 
how to contact me and Frequently Asked Questions from readers, which may 
correspond to your own.

     My plan about a month ago was to do a full-fledged, complete Majora's Mask 
FAQ/Walkthrough. As the fateful day approached when this game came out, I knew I 
was in some trouble. I had my hands full with all my other FAQs, and another new 
FAQ was not what I needed to spend serious time on. So, at the last second I 
chickened out and decided not to make a FAQ for Majora's Mask. But if that were 
true, why are you reading this? Obviously I changed my mind somewhere, right? 
Actually, it's more complicated than that. No wait, it's not. 
     As I played the game, having a great time, I noticed that I particularly 
enjoyed helping people out that were in the Bombers' Notebook. Eventually, it 
dawned on me that I didn't have to make a huge walkthrough like I normally do, 
but I could target my favorite part of the game and do a really good job. So I 
did.
     This is the first time I've done an In-Depth FAQ. Long, complete FAQs are 
my normal fare, but this time I think I'll do something different. So here it 
is: difference. Feels so strange... yet comforting.



              ----- HOW TO READ THE BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK -----

     In this section, I'll cover both how to read the Bomber's Notebook in the 
game, as well as how my coverage of each person will be set up and what's what. 
Basically, this section is for those of you who either like to read everything 
or grasp things a little slowly. 

-HOW TO READ THE IN-GAME BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK-
The Bombers' Notebook is quite simple, but in case you don't understand it, I'll 
go over it. The sign on top of the Milk Bar will also help you out. The book can 
be accessed by pressing A while highlighting it on the Pause Screen.

*Each square on the left side of the book is a place for a character. When you 
talk to a character that can be placed here, whether you help them or not, their 
picture will be placed here.

*To the left of the character, there will be one or more blue bars. For each 
blue bar, an event will occur. There are three different things that could 
happen, marked by the following symbols:

     -Exclamation Circle: This means that you have made an appointment 
      with or a promise to a person to do something.
     -Ribbon: This means you have received an item for helping out the
      character.
     -Mask Symbol: This means you have received a mask for helping out 
      the character.

The symbols will not appear until you do something. To find out when the event 
occurs, look above the blue bar to the time table at the top. Each shaded region 
represents a six hour period. If there are multiple blue bars over the same time 
period, multiple events will occur.

*When every event has been completed, a Happiness Seal will appear on the far 
right. This means you have helped this character out entirely.


-HOW TO READ THIS FAQ'S BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK COVERAGE-
In this FAQ, there will be a consistent setup for each person. The entries will 
go in the order that they appear in the notebook. Below is a sample setup, with 
descriptions of each of the parts.

**SAMPLE SETUP***
________________________________________________________________________
               
                         ====== EXAMPLE ======
________________________________________________________________________

Description: This is the description displayed in the Bombers' Notebook.
     It's brief, but gives you a quick overview of the person. 
Profession: This is what the person does for a living. If they don't 
     work, it's a hobby or interest they spend a lot of time on.
Home: Where the character lives or usually hangs out.
Character Relations: Here you'll find who the person knows and/or 
     interacts with that is also in the Bombers' Notebook. 
Other Relations: Here you'll find who the person knows and/or 
     interacts with that is not in the Bombers' Notebook.
Problems: Look here to find the main troubles of the character.
Additional Info: Anything else that might be of interest about the 
     character.
Comments: I'll place any comments I have about the character and/or the
     events that take place. There won't be any spoilers, though.
Schedule: This lists the daily lives of the character, and where they 
     are during each day. Some characters do the same things no matter
     what, while others are affected by events. In the latter case,
     there will be two lists: one for when nothing affects them and one
     for when all the corresponding events take place. 
  *Spoiler-Free Note*- If you want the least spoilers possible, look at
     the schedule. Where the person goes will just give you a basic clue
     as to what goes on, and may help you. However, this does not always
     give you enough information. 

*SAMPLE SCHEDULE*
     Day 1, 8:00 AM -  Location: Stock Pot Inn     
                       Activity: Sleeping In
     Day 1, 10:00 AM - Location: East Clock Town  
                       Activity: Goes for a Walk
     Day 2, 12:00 PM - Location: Milk Bar     
                       Activity: Drinking Milk
                                                    ...etc. 

Events/Prerequisites/Optional Events: 
This is where you go to find the info you need in detail. Each of these are 
different. Events are indicated in the In-Game Bombers' by blue bars. If you're 
in the right place at the right time and do the right thing, something will 
happen. Prerequisites are things that occur prior to an event that you must 
fulfill, but are not indicated in your notebook. Sometimes it's a matter of not 
doing something. Optional Events are also not indicated in the notebook, and it 
is not necessary to complete what is indicated to succeed. However, often times 
the story is revealed more and you may get a hint. Below is the format that each 
of these will be setup into. 

---EVENT 1---
Location: Milk Bar                  Time: 11:00 PM
Items Needed: Mask of Scents, Song of Soaring
--In this space, what you have to do is given in detail. This basically explains 
what you have to do. This may include some things that go on during the 
process.--
   *Spoiler-Free Note*- If you want to find more out on your own, just
   look at the Location, Time, and Items Needed at the top. If you 
   don't mind being told exactly what you have to do, read the text
   below it. However, do not read beyond this point, or there is a 
   chance of a spoiler.
DESCRIPTION: After you do what you have to do, this part explains what
     goes on.
ITEMS RECEIVED: This is what you get out of the encounter, whether it be
     a mask, a piece of heart, an item, or nothing.

/__\  /__\====================================================/__\  /__\

     In this guide, not only will you find out how to get the happiness seals 
for every character, but you'll also find detailed info about each person, 
including schedules, relationships, and their professions. There's even a 
special setup to guide you through the events, with detailed directions on how 
to complete them. For those of you that don't mind spoilers, there's 
descriptions of the events that take place, and for those that do, I've set it 
up in a special way to reduce spoilers (check out Part 1, Section 2's "How to 
Read This FAQ's Bombers' Notebook Guide" to find the optimal way to read it). 
The secrets of the universe have been revealed...

                         ====== BOMBERS ======
________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION: Secret Society of Justice. Helping people out 24 hours a 
   day.
PROFESSION: None (these are kids), but spend a lot of time helping 
   out others.
HOME: Clock Town
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Jim, the Leader of the Bombers
OTHER RELATIONS: Astral Observatory Astronomer
PROBLEMS: Trouble shooting down Balloon (Jim), Looking for fun
ADDITIONAL INFO: Friendly, curious children of Clock Town. They wander
   the town, and, like most children, love to play. Though they don't 
   take kindly to other races, they are constantly looking for new 
   members. They also have extensive knowledge about many of the local    
   masks, and might drop a clue about what they're for.
COMMENTS: If you have the Bombers' Notebook, you've completed this 
   already. Therefore, the events that follow will basically just tell 
   you how to get the Bombers' Notebook. There are two ways to get it.

-SCHEDULE- 
     Day 1, All Day - Location: North/West/East Clock Town
                      Activity: Walk Around, Shoot at Balloon (Jim)
     Day 2, All Day - Location: North/West/East Clock Town
                      Activity: Walk Around, Shoot at Balloon (Jim)
     Day 3, All Day - Location: North/West/East Clock Town
                      Activity: Walk Around, Shoot at Balloon (Jim)


---EVENT 1---
Location: North Clock Town          Time: Any Time
Items Required: Magic Power

If you've already passed the first set of three days, you'll have finished this 
Event. If you're stuck, read on. It can be completed while you're still a Deku, 
but you must have visited the Great Fairy in North Clock Town and have received 
Magic Power. Wherever you are, head to North Clock Town, where Jim (the Leader 
of the Bombers) is trying to burst the Majora Balloon. He really needs some 
practice, because he won't get the thing down even after three days. Take pity 
on the poor lad and shoot a bubble from your Deku snout at the balloon, causing 
it to pop. Go over and talk to him, and he'll challenge you to a game of hide-
and-seek. The Bombers will split up, and you have to catch them. Use your Spin 
attack to get them. In North Clock Town, Jim hides behind the slide and another 
Bomber hides behind the tree near the Deku Game. In East Clock Town, one Bomber 
is near the roof of the Milk Bar. As you approach, he'll jump off holding onto a 
Cucco. Jump down and chase him. A second Bomber in East Clock Town hangs out 
near the bell on the veranda of Stock Pot Inn. Use the Deku Flower by the 
Treasure Chest Shop to reach him. In West Clock Town, a single Bomber hangs out 
in front of the Post Office. 

DESCRIPTION: Once you find all the Bombers, Jim will reveal the secret code that 
will allow you to enter the Bombers' Hideout (the shortcut to the Astral 
Observatory). They won't allow you into the club, however, because you're a 
Deku.
ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---EVENT 2---
Location: North Clock Town          Time: Any Time
Items Required: Deku Mask

For completing this Event, you will receive the Bombers' Notebook. There are two 
ways you can get it, but both require you to be Link. The first method is to pop 
the Majora Balloon in North Clock Town again (with arrows or bubbles), then talk 
to Jim as Link. You'll play another round of hide-and-seek, and if you win, the 
Bombers' will let you join and you'll receive a Bombers' Notebook. The second 
method is easier. Tell the code to the Bomber guarding the entrance to the sewer 
(leading to the Astral Observatory), enter the sewer, then go back out. Go to 
North Clock Town and talk to Jim, and he'll give you a Bombers' Notebook. 
Simple, isn't it?

DESCRIPTION: None
ITEMS RECEIVED: Bombers' Notebook



________________________________________________________________________
               
                           ====== ANJU ======
________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION: Stock Pot Inn's innkeeper. A courteous woman.
PROFESSION: Stock Pot Inn Innkeeper
HOME: East Clock Town
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Kafei, Anju's Grandmother, Gorman
OTHER RELATIONS: Link-goro, Tortus (Father, deceased)
PROBLEMS: Her future husband recently disappeared without a trace
ADDITIONAL INFO: Anju is a very polite person. She works at the Stock 
   Pot Inn, which has been owned by her family for generations. With the 
   Carnival of Time coming up, she doesn't have any room left in the 
   Inn, and is somewhat stressed. Combined with the fact that her lover
   disappeared, her grandmother won't eat anything, and the giant moon 
   is about to crush Termina, she's going through a lot right now.
COMMENTS: Anju and Kafei's notebook entries are intertwined, and you 
   cannot complete one without going through at least parts of the 
   other. That being said, this is my favorite chain of events, and 
   it's very exciting, fun... and frustrating.

---Prerequisite---
Location: South Clock Town          Time: 6:00 AM (Day 1)
Items Required: None

At the start of the first day, you'll emerge from the giant Clock. Straight 
ahead, near the entry to the Laundry Pool, a masked boy will come out and 
deposit a letter. If you wish to complete Events 2 and beyond, you must watch 
him deposit the letter. 


---EVENT 1---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Lobby       Time: 1:50 PM to 4:00 PM (Day 1)
Items Required: None

While you need to complete this event to get the happiness seal, it is not 
required for the completion of the following chain of events. After Anju returns 
from bringing her grandmother lunch, talk to her. Before she leaves to bring her 
grandmother lunch, she'll ask if you're spending the night, but neither answer 
will get you anywhere. However, from now until 4:00 she'll ask if you have a 
reservation. Say yes.

DESCRIPTION: If you say yes, Anju will check the book, and surprisingly, your 
name is there. She'll give you the key to the "Knife Chamber", a room in the 
middle of the hallway on the second floor. Inside is a chest with 100 rupees. 
You can also use this key to enter the Inn at night. 
ITEMS RECEIVED: Room Key


---Optional Event---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Lobby       Time: 2:10 PM to 2:30 PM (Day 1)
Items Required: None

At this short period of time, the Postman will deliver the letter deposited by 
the masked youth earlier. Talk to either Anju or the Postman to hear the 
conversation between them.


---EVENT 2---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Lobby       Time: 2:30 PM to 7:50 PM (Day 1)
Items Required: Kafei's Mask

Visit Anju at this time. Nothing will happen if you talk to her, but if you put 
on Kafei's Mask and speak she'll be very surprised.

DESCRIPTION: Anju will find out that you're also searching for Kafei if you wear 
the mask, and she then wishes to ask a favor of you. She'll set up an 
appointment with you at 11:30 tonight in the Inn Kitchen.
ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---EVENT 3---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Kitchen     Time: 11:30 PM to 6:00 AM (Day 1)
Items Required: None

When it gets late at night, head for the Inn. If you completed Event 1, you can 
simply waltz right in through the door. If you didn't, it'll be locked. To get 
in, transform into a Deku and enter the Flower by the Treasure Chest Game. Jump 
out and float over to the straw roof by the bell, then onto the veranda and into 
the unlocked door. Go to the kitchen to meet Anju.

DESCRIPTION: In the Kitchen, Anju will explain the tale of Kafei, and how she is 
looking for him. She wishes to send him a letter, but is too afraid to do it 
herself. She'll give you the letter and ask you to mail it. She'll tell you to 
mail it in the morning, but you can do it during the night as well. Take it to a 
mailbox and put it in. Before heading on to Anju's next event, you will need to 
complete several of Kafei's events.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Anju's Letter to Kafei


---EVENT 4---
Location: Stock Pot Inn             
Time: 4:45 PM to 8:30 PM (Day 2), 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM (Day 3)
Items Required: Pendant of Memories

After completing the first of Kafei's events, return to the Stock Pot Inn and 
deliver the Pendant of Memories to Anju. If you miss her on the third day, you 
can also give this item to her on the first quarter of the third day.

DESCRIPTION: The Pendant of Memories will remind Anju of the happiness she and 
Kafei had, and she'll trust him. This will make her wait for Kafei's return, 
because she believes him. After giving her the Pendant, you must go back to 
helping Kafei, or you will not be able to complete Anju's fifth and final event.
ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---Optional Event---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Employees Room
Time: 9:30 PM (Day 2)
Items Required: Room Key

On the night of the second day, head to your room at the Stock Pot Inn (if you 
didn't get the Room Key, you can't experience this). Go up to the area of the 
wall that's dilapidated (Tatl will fly over to it). If you check this spot, 
you'll overhear the conversation between Anju and her mother in the next room. 


---EVENT 5---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Employees Room 
Time: 4:30 AM to 5:59 AM (Day 3)
Items Required: None

This event is also covered in the Kafei section, as Kafei and Anju will finally 
be brought together. Therefore, I'll use the same description here as in 
Kafei's. After helping Kafei retrieve the Sun Mask, use your Ocarina to warp 
back to Clock Town. Head to the Inn, and go up to the Employees Room. It'll be 
unlocked. Enter, and you'll see Anju wait for Kafei. Stick around for a while.

DESCRIPTION: At 4:30 (a mere hour and a half before the moon hits Termina), 
Kafei will finally make it to the Inn (he did have to walk all the way from 
Ikana Canyon, you know). When he enters, he and Anju will be reunited. Not 
caring about the moon and the fact that they'll be dead in a couple hours, they 
combine their masks, of the Sun and Moon, as they would at their wedding. Since 
they're so happy and have no need for the newly-created mask, they'll give it to 
Link.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Couple's Mask

                           ====== KAFEI ======
________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION: Strange youth seen near Laundry Pool 
PROFESSION: Unknown
HOME: Curiosity Shop Backroom
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Anju, Man from Curiosity Shop
OTHER RELATIONS: Sakon the Thief
PROBLEMS: Hiding for unknown reasons
ADDITIONAL INFO: As not to spoil anything, I will refrain from revealing
   anything about Kafei here. If you wish to know, Kafei is the 
   character with purple hair and is sporting a Keaton Mask. He lives in
   the locked door near the Laundry Pool
COMMENTS: As I said with Anju, it's really fun to figure this thing 
   out. Tracking the little Kafei to his house and trying to find a way
   in is a lot of fun. You know what? I think that in the next Majora's
   Mask (if there is one, of course), Kafei should be the main 
   character. That'd be cool. 

-EVENT SCHEDULE- 
     Day 1, 6:00 AM - Location: South Clock Town 
                      Activity: Deposits Letter

                      Activity: Waiting

---Prerequisite---
If you wish to start completing Kafei's events, you must have completed Anju's 
Events 2 and 3. After those, you can start on Kafei.


---EVENT 1---
Location: Laundry Pool              Time: 3:25 PM to 4:00 PM (Day 2)
Items Required: Deposited Anju's Letter to Kafei

You may want to follow the Postman around before this, or you can just be sure 
to be at the Laundry Pool at 3:25. Wait for the Postman to arrive, then when 
Kafei comes out to receive the letter, dash behind him and into the door. Wait 
inside for Kafei to come in.

DESCRIPTION: When Kafei comes back, talk to him. He'll take off his mask and 
reveal that he is Kafei (if it wasn't obvious), and he'll give you the Pendant 
of Memories to take to Anju (see Anju's events). He'll also tell you about the 
Thief that stole his wedding mask, which he promised to meet Anju with. He's 
waiting for the thief to sell his goods at the Curiosity Shop, and is waiting 
for his arrival.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Pendant of Memories.


---Prerequisite---
If you want to be able to complete the last two events, you must not stop Sakon 
the Thief from stealing the Bomb Bag from the Old Lady. Make sure the Bomb Bags 
are stolen.


---EVENT 2---
Location: Ikana Canyon              Time: 6:00 PM (Day 3)
Items Required: Epona, Hookshot

After delivering the Pendant to Anju, head to Ikana Valley. Do not be late, or 
you will suffer the consequences. I suggest arriving at least an hour before six 
(game time, of course. I should hope you don't try waiting there an hour in real 
time...). So, where in Ikana Canyon should you go? First, you must make it up 
the steep cliff where the phantom sits by showing it the Garo Mask. Continue 
down the path, then when you enter the next area, head to the right. Up the 
trail you'll come across Sakon the Thief's hideout. If you look to the left of 
his hideout, you'll see a couple rocks. Behind them is a patient Kafei, waiting 
for Sakon. You'll need to wait, too. Hide behind the tallest part of the rocks 
so that Sakon doesn't see you. If he spots you, he'll leave. At 6:15, Sakon will 
start up the path, and at 7:00 he'll open the door to his hideout. Kafei will 
run in after him, and you should follow. 

DESCRIPTION: Sakon's hideout is very large. When you enter, go through the first 
door to catch up with Kafei. Kafei will accidentally set off an alarm, causing 
the Sun Mask that he wants to begin to move on a conveyor belt toward a hole 
where Sakon is waiting. You'll need to reach the end of the conveyor belt before 
the mask drops. Follow the directions below.

 -Room 1, Kafei: In the first room, push one of the blocks inward and 
  onto the switch that opens the door for Link.
 -Room 1, Link: Defeat the Deku Baba near the exit door.
 -Room 2, Kafei: Don't step on the red switches, becausethey'll speed up
  the conveyor belt. The yellow ones will slow it, and the blue one will 
  open up the door for Link.
 -Room 2, Link: There's two Deku Baba in here. Kill them.
 -Room 3, Kafei: This puzzle is a tad trickier, but not by much. Move
  the block leftmost on the top row to the right, then pull the leftmost 
  block in the middle row back. Go down and step on the switch.
 -Room 3, Link: There's a Wolfos in here. Fortunately, it'll only take
  two hits to kill, and it becomes vulnerable often.
 -Room 4: Step on both switches with Kafei and Link to get the mask.

ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---EVENT 3---
Location: Stock Pot Inn Employee Room 
Time: 4:30 AM to 5:59 AM (Day 3)
Items Required: None

After helping Kafei retrieve the Sun Mask, use your Ocarina to warp back to 
Clock Town. Head to the Inn, and go up to the Employees Room. It'll be unlocked. 
Enter, and you'll see Anju waiting for Kafei. Stick around for a while.

DESCRIPTION: At 4:30 (a mere hour and a half before the moon hits Termina), 
Kafei will finally make it to the Inn (he did have to walk all the way from 
Ikana Canyon, you know). When he enters, he and Anju will be reunited. Not

DESCRIPTION: Buys and sells stolen goods. Open at night only.
PROFESSION: Curiosity Shop Proprietor
HOME: Curiosity Shop
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Kafei
OTHER RELATIONS: Sakon the Thief
PROBLEMS: Needs to Buy/Sell Items
ADDITIONAL INFO: It's hard to tell if this guy is good or bad. While 
   he's friends with the noble Kafei, his entire business is selling 
   stolen items. He says that he's just providing the goods to the 
   public, not stealing them, but he's still a dirty thief. Nonetheless,
   he's got some good stuff and will help you out.
COMMENTS: You cannot complete Events 1-2 and Event 3 on the same three
   day period, so you'll need to go through at least two different times
   to complete everything.

-SCHEDULE- 
     Days 1-3, 10:00 PM  - Location: Curiosity Shop 
                           Activity: Opens Shop
     Days 1-3, 5:00 AM -   Location: Curiosity Shop
                           Activity: Closes Shop

---EVENT 1---
Location: Curiosity Shop Backroom  
Time: 1:00 PM to 10:00 PM (Day 3)
Items Required: Pendant of Memories

To be able to enter the Backroom, you must first complete Event 1 with Kafei. On 
the afternoon of the third day, return to the Curiosity Shop Backroom. Inside 
will be the Man from the Curiosity Shop. Talk to him.

DESCRIPTION: The Man from the Curiosity Shop will tell you about Kafei and how 
he took off after Sakon. He'll also give you the Keaton Mask. This mask can be 
used to summon the ghost foxes, Keatons. You know those bushes that dance around 
after you cut one? Put on the Keaton Mask beforehand, cut them up, and when 
they're all gone a Keaton will appear. 
ITEMS RECEIVED: Keaton Mask 


---EVENT 2---
Location: Curiosity Shop Backroom   
Time: 1:00 PM to 10:00 PM (Day 3)
Items Required: Pendant of Memories

Right after you receive the previous item, the Man from the Curiosity Shop will 
also give you another item.

DESCRIPTION: This item is a Letter to Kafei's Mama, or as she is known, Madame 
Aroma. There are two ways to get it to her. See either the Postman or Madame 
Aroma's entries.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Letter to Kafei's Mama


---Prerequisite---
See the "Old Lady from Bomb Shop" entry. Basically, you must stop Sakon the 
Thief from making off with the Old Lady's bomb bags. You can either prevent this 
from happening by knocking the bomb bag from him with your sword, or shooting an 
arrow at the bag, causing the bomb bags to explode, killing Sakon. Just make 
sure that the bomb bag never reaches the Curiosity Shop. 


---EVENT 3---
Location: Curiosity Shop            Time: 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM (Day 3)
Items Required: Giant's Wallet

After making sure Sakon's delivery doesn't make it to the Curiosity Shop 
(meaning if you've completed Events 1 and 2 this time, you'll need to start over 
from Day 1), pay it a visit on Day 3. Instead of Bomb Bags, the Man from the 
Curiosity Shop will have the All-Night Mask. It costs 500 rupees, which means 
you'll need the Giant's Wallet to purchase it.  

DESCRIPTION: The All-Night Mask gives you the power to stay awake as long as you 
have it on, no matter how much you want to fall asleep.
ITEMS RECEIVED: All-Night Mask

                  ====== OLD LADY FROM BOMB SHOP ======
________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION: Runs town bomb shop. Always open.
PROFESSION: Sells Bombs, Bombchus, Bomb Bags
HOME: Bomb Shop
CHARACTER RELATIONS: None
OTHER RELATIONS: Man from Bomb Shop, Sakon the Thief
PROBLEMS: Wishes to Stock Big Bomb Bags
ADDITIONAL INFO: The Old Lady from the Bomb Shop doesn't really have 
   that much of a personality. She wants to stock the shop with Big 
   Bomb Bags, and she'll be making a delivery soon.
COMMENTS: For generations, the Bomb Shop's owners' dreams have been to 
   stock Big Bomb Bags. What kind of sorry dream is that? Anyway, 
   you'll need to help the old lady fulfill the dream, although she 
   thinks she's got it covered.

-SCHEDULE- 
     Day 1, 12:00 PM - Location: North Clock Town 
                       Activity: Enters Clock Town
     Day 1, 12:30 PM - Location: West Clock Town Bomb Shop
                       Activity: Arrives at Bomb Shop


---EVENT 1---
Location: North Clock Town          Time: 12:20 PM (Day 1)
Items Required: Sword

Be sure to be in North Clock Town at midnight, when the Old Lady arrives. She'll 
walk through the town cautiously, and keep a close eye on her. 

DESCRIPTION: As she walks down the path, the Old Lady's Bomb Bag is swiped by 
Sakon the Thief. You'll need to hit him with your sword to get him to drop the 
bag. Do not shoot an arrow, or the bag will explode. You know what? That guard 
is pretty lazy; he just lets Sakon walk right by. If you get the sack back, the 
Old Lady will reward you with the Blast Mask. This mask seems kinda dumb. It 
creates an explosion, but costs some life. While this may sound idiotic, it 
actually means you have an unlimited supply of bombs, so long as you have some 
hearts to spare. Actually, I've recently learned that this can be prevented if 
you put up your shield before detonating it. If you do that, you'll merely be 
knocked back a little ways and it will not cost you any hearts.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Blast Mask

DESCRIPTION: Young girl living at ranch with sister.
PROFESSION: Helps Cremia Run the Romani Ranch
HOME: Romani Ranch
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Cremia
OTHER RELATIONS: None
PROBLEMS: Cows Are Being Stolen
ADDITIONAL INFO: Romani, named after the famous ranch down Milk Road, is
   a skilled archer. Unfortunately, even with her skills, she has a 
   problem of the ranch's cows being stolen every year two days before
   the Carnival of Time. To make things even worse, her older sister,
   Cremia, doesn't believe her. 
COMMENTS: The events involving Romani are pretty cool, and it's 
   definitely something to see. It may help if you have the Bunny Hood.

-SCHEDULE- 
     Day 1, 6:00 AM - Location: Romani Ranch Field
                      Activity: Running Around

                      Activity: Goes to Bed
     Day 3, 6:00 AM - Location: Romani Ranch
                      Activity: Walking Around


---EVENT 1---
Location: Romani Ranch              Time: 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM (Day 1)
Items Required: Powder Keg, Bow

During the daylight hours of day one, blast the boulder blocking the Romani 
Ranch out of the way using a Powder Keg (get this in Goron Village). Once the 
path is cleared, head to the ranch and in front of the house and barn. Here 
Romani is running around, getting prepared for what will be happening tonight. 
She'll ask you to help out, but first you must pass a test. 

DESCRIPTION: The test Romani will give you to make sure you're good enough to 
help requires you to ride across the ranch on Epona, popping 10 ghost-shaped 
balloons in under 2 minutes. This shouldn't be very difficult, and beating the 
record of 1 minute isn't even very hard. If you pass the test, you'll become a 
ranch hand and you can go to save the ranch from the ghosts at 2:30 AM. As an 
added bonus, you'll get to keep Epona.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Epona 


---EVENT 2---
Location: Romani Ranch              Time: 2:30 AM (Day 1)
Items Required: Bow

When it gets late, head over to Romani Ranch. I suggest not arriving any later 
than 1:45, preferably sooner. Run over to the barn and get ready for the ghosts 
to come. They arrive at 2:30.

DESCRIPTION: There are two ways to defeat the ghosts. The first, which I think 
is more exciting, is to ride around on Epona, shooting the ghosts as you ride. 
The second way is to put on the Bunny Hood and run around. The second is a bit 
easier. The ghosts are easy to find by their orange glow, and they also appear 
as white dots on the map (if you haven't purchased one, it's a good idea to). 
Don't worry about the ones far away in the field; instead, focus on the ones 
closer to the barn. Two commonly missed ghosts are one that comes from behind 
the house and one that comes from the entrance along the side of the ranch. The 
ghosts regenerate, so you'll have to wait until dawn (5:15 AM) until they're all 
gone. It arrives faster than you'd think.
ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---EVENT 3---
Location: Romani Ranch              Time: 5:15 AM (Day 1)
Items Required: None

This really isn't an event, but your reward for saving the cows from the ghosts.

DESCRIPTION: Romani shows her thanks by offering you another bottle, filled to 
the top with delicious milk from the grateful cows.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Bottle with Milk

---Prerequisite---
If you want to complete Cremia's events, you must also complete those of Romani. 
If you don't, the cows that Cremia will milk will be gone, and she'll be too 
worried about her sister to go anywhere if she could.


---EVENT 1---
Location: Romani Ranch              Time: 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM (Day 2)
Items Required: Bow

After completing Romani's events, return to the ranch on Day 2 at 6:00 PM to 
meet up with Cremia. She'll be in her wagon getting ready to head into Clock 
Town to make a delivery. Accept her invitation to ride along.

DESCRIPTION: The first half of the ride will be nice and calm as you and Cremia 
share a nice conversation. However, halfway down Milk Road, a fence has been put 
up. Cremia will be forced to take a detour through the Gorman track. Two masked 
bandits (hmm... I wonder who they could be... maybe the Gorman Bros.?) will 
attack from behind, and you'll have to fend them off as Cremia dashes through 
their territory. The bandits aren't interested in stealing the milk, but 
crushing the competition by smashing the bottles. Use your bow and arrows to 
discourage them from coming closer. If a milk bottle or two gets destroyed, it's 
OK, but if you save them all you'll get an extra reward. If you want to 
guarantee you'll save them all, put on the Circus Leader's Mask (which cannot be 
received until after you complete this event for the first time) and the masked 
horsemen won't attack.  
ITEMS RECEIVED: 200 rupees (if you save all bottles)


---EVENT 2---
Location: Milk Road                 Time: 9:00 PM (Day 2)
Items Required: None

As long as some milk bottles remain, Cremia will be happy to have made a 
shipment, as well as Mr. Barten for finally getting some more milk.

DESCRIPTION: Protect the bottles of milk well, and Cremia will reward you with 
Romani's Mask. This mask signifies you as an adult, but more importantly is the 
proof of membership you need to get in the Milk Bar in East Clock Town at night.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Romani's Mask

they want to stay. As thanks for ending the looong meeting (spelled like that in 
the game), Mr. Dotour will give you a Piece of Heart.

DESCRIPTION: Madame Aroma will ask you to help find her missing son, Kafei, who 
disappeared just a few days ago. To help with the search, she gives you Kafei's 
Mask, and people will give you hints about Kafei when you show it to them.

PROBLEMS: The Indigo-Go's will have to cancel their show.
ADDITIONAL INFO: Toto, the plump Zora who manages the incredibly-popular
   Indigo-Go's, will have to cancel his show because Lulu, the singer 
   for the group, has lost her voice. This really hurts the Carnival of
   Time, and the Gorman Troupe.
COMMENTS: He he he! He's cute and fat! Not like that fat Madame 
   Aroma... Anyway, Toto's events will take place later in the game, 
   so don't try to finish them right away. Although you can try and
   fail if you'd like. 

-SCHEDULE- 
     Days 1-2, 10:00 AM - Location: Mayor's Residence

Items Required: Deku Mask, Goron Mask, Zora Mask, Romani's Mask

After completing Cremia's event, and collecting all of the transformation masks, 
head to the Milk Bar during its hours of operation. Toto will be standing by the 
stage, wondering what the performance would've been like. Give him a sample by 
talking to him in each of the transformations, then going where he says on the 
stage and playing what he says.

DESCRIPTION: After all four characters have played, the song will be put 
together. It's none other than the famous "Ballad of the Wind Fish". This song 
will touch Gorman, who's also at the bar. He'll give you the Circus Leader's 
Mask for bringing back memories of hearing the tune.

DESCRIPTION: Leader of a traveling troupe. Has fine clothes, but a 
   frightful face.
PROFESSION: Leader of the Gorman Troupe
HOME: Unknown 
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Gorman Bros., Rosa Sisters, Madame Aroma, Guru-Guru
OTHER RELATIONS: Twin Jugglers, Mr. Barten 
PROBLEMS: Troupe's Performance has been Cancelled
ADDITIONAL INFO: Gorman has left the family business of raising horses
   and entered show business. Since his face would frighten children, 
   he's not in the act, but instead manages the troupe. Madame Aroma 
   had called upon the Gorman Troupe to do the Opening Act for the 
   Indigo-Go's, but now that they've cancelled, the Troupe's 
   performance is off.
COMMENTS: Gorman isn't a very kind fellow, much like his Bros. It's 
   probably due to the stress in his life and the recent cancellation 
   of the Troupe's Performance... poor Gorman. Anyway, Gorman's events 
   are linked directly to Toto's, so if you finish Toto's you'll finish
   Gorman's. Comprendez-vous?

Gorman goes to the Milk Bar at night to drink away his sorrows. To complete his 
event, you must help Toto out. Here's what to do. Toto will be standing by the

talking to him in each of the transformations, then going where he says on the

DESCRIPTION: Town's postal carrier. A very serious public servant.
PROFESSION: Postman of Clock Town
HOME: West Clock Town
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Anju, Kafei 
OTHER RELATIONS: None
PROBLEMS: His Job is Very Demanding
ADDITIONAL INFO: The Postman is incredibly serious about his job, and 
   when he's not doing it, he's practicing to do a better job. As much 
   as he loves his job, he longs to get away from the trouble.
COMMENTS: It's kinda comforting seeing this guy running around 
   collecting letters, and it really portrays the fact that people do
   things only at certain times of the day in this game. 

-SCHEDULE- 
     Days 1-3, 9:00 AM -  Location: Clock Town 
                          Activity: Begins to Pick Up Mail

                          Activity: Practicing


---EVENT 1---
Location: Post Office               Time: 3:00 PM to 12:00 AM (Days 1-2)
Items Required: None

At this time, the Postman will be training. His strange game is to guess the 
exact time when 10 seconds (real time) have passed, with only looking at clock 
for the first couple seconds. He'll let you try it out (if you fail the first 
time, it'll cost you two rupees every additional time you try). Since the timer 
goes to the hundredths place, this is somewhat difficult. Actually, I got it on 
my second try so I wouldn't know :). Pay attention to the clock at the 
beginning, because it ticks with a rhythm. Keep it in your head and count the 
seconds. I like to think "1 tick tick tick 2 tick tick tick 3 tick tick tick", 
etc. until it reaches ten. Also, I've recently learned that if you put on the 
Bunny Hood during this game, not only will the timer reduce to the tenths place, 
but it'll stay on the screen the entire time. This will make completing this 
event much easier.

DESCRIPTION: If you stop the timer on exactly 10'00", the Postman will reward 
you with a Piece of Heart.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Piece of Heart


---EVENT 2---
Location: Postbox                  
Time: 12:00 AM (Day 1) to 12:00 PM (Day 2)
Items Required: Anju's Letter to Kafei

This event is part of the Anju and Kafei events. Deposit the letter that you 
receive in Anju's Event 3 before the Postman comes. When he picks it up, you'll 
complete this event.

DESCRIPTION: None
ITEMS RECEIVED: None


---EVENT 3---
Location: East Clock Town           Time: 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM (Day 3)
Items Required: Letter to Kafei's Mama

Although you can deliver the letter you receive from the Man from the Curiosity 
Shop directly to Madame Aroma, the only way to complete the Postman's last event 
is to have him do it. Go to the post office, and you'll find the Postman wishing 
he could flee. Give him the letter and he'll recognize the priority seal and 
deliver it right away.

DESCRIPTION: Follow the Postman to the Milk Bar, where he'll give the letter to 
Madame Aroma. After receiving word from her son, Madame Aroma will tell the 
Postman to flee town, regardless of his job. After he exits the Milk Bar, go 
outside. By the East Clock Town exit gate, you'll find the Postman. Talk to him, 
and he'll thank you for helping relieve him of his life-threatening duty by 
giving you the Postman's Hat. With this you can check Mailboxes like the 
Postman. While you can't pick up letters, every time you check you'll get one 
rupee. Also, the first time you check a mailbox you'll get a Piece of Heart. 
ITEMS RECEIVED: Postman's Hat

across the hall from Anju's Grandmother's Room (the study). When you enter, 
???'s hand will rise from the toilet, and he'll scream for some paper (it's up 
to your imagination to figure out why). Give him either a Land Title Deed or a 
Letter, any kind of each will do.

one of the messes), and he'll give you a Piece of Heart as thanks.

   can learn that she was a teacher, one of her students being Mayor
   Dotour himself. She's also mother of Tortus, who died recently. She
   dislikes her granddaughter's food, so she tries to trick Anju out
   of giving it to her. She enjoys telling stories.
COMMENTS: This is one of those events that you won't be able to 
   complete until later.

know you're close when you hear the music. Go up to the top of the cliff (closer 
to the Clock Town wall) and jump to the top of the rock formation. Talk to this 
crazy guy. 

DESCRIPTION: Kamaro will tell you about how troubled he is, and that he is also 
a spirit of a famous dancer. If you paid attention when you got the Song of 
Healing, the Happy Mask guy told you it would heal troubled spirits. Hmm... what

all following you, they'll change into adults.

Once you get Epona back, go down Milk Road and to the Gorman Track. Speak to the 
older Gorman Brother (near the track) while on Epona, and he'll challenge you to 
a horse race. In the race, there is one main rule to follow: always stay on the 
inside of the track. It is imperative to jump over the fences on the inside 
instead of going around them. Don't be afraid to consume energy, and remember 
that it is quicker to regain all your energy if you use it all. If you time your 
speed boosts just right, you should be able to win fairly easily. 

DESCRIPTION: The Gorman Bros., surprised that you won, will reluctantly hand 
over the Garo Mask. This is an important mask late in the game, as it can summon 
the legendary Garo warriors.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Garo Mask

However, this guy's invisible. Put on the Lens of Truth to be able to spot him. 
He sits in a circle of stones near the straight-up cliff that you hookshot up. 
Talk to Shiro to hear his dilemma. 

DESCRIPTION: Shiro has been waiting here, hurt, for a long time, but no one 
notices him. Bring him some Red Potion to cure his wounds. After he feels 
better, the reason he's invisible will become clear: he's been unintentionally 
wearing the Stone Mask, which makes its wearer invisible. He'll give it to you a 
present for helping him out.
ITEMS RECEIVED: Stone Mask

     In this part of the Bombers' Notebook FAQ, I'll basically give you 
additional information that relates to the Bombers' Notebook. This includes a 
map so artistically drawn (in ASCII art, of course) by myself, as well as 
descriptions and schedules of some major characters that don't appear in the 
Bombers' Notebook, such as the greedy Sakon the Thief.

                      ----- OTHER CHARACTERS -----

     There are a bunch of other characters in Majora's Mask that aren't in the 
Bombers' Notebook, yet still have interesting schedules and are related to the 
other characters. While I won't list every character in the game here, I will 
list some that have actual schedules and descriptions.


======SAKON THE THIEF======
PROFESSION: Thief 
HOME: Ikana Canyon
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Man from Curiosity Shop, Kafei, 
   Old Lady from Bomb Shop
OTHER RELATIONS: None
ADDITIONAL INFO: Sakon, while appearing as a nice, happy person, is 
   really a ruthless thief. He'll steal just about anything from just 
   about anybody, and usually sells his stolen goods to the Curiosity 
   Shop. He's a key character in several events, although he is the bad 
   guy.

-SCHEDULE-
     Days 1-2, Day -   Location: Ikana Canyon
                       Activity: Prancing
     Day 1, Night -    Location: North Clock Town
                       Activity: Stealing Bomb Bag
     Day 2, 12:00 AM - Location: Curiosity Shop
                       Activity: Selling Bomb Bag to Curiosity Shop
     Day 3, 6:10 PM -  Location: Ikana Canyon
                       Activity: Returns to Hideout


======MR. BARTEN======
PROFESSION: Bartender at Milk Bar 
HOME: East Clock Town
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Gorman, Madame Aroma, Toto, Kafei
OTHER RELATIONS: None
ADDITIONAL INFO: Mr. Barten (who is quite fittingly named) runs the
   Milk Bar in East Clock Town. He doesn't really have a whole lot of
   personality, but only lets those in the bar that have membership and
   makes them display it the entire time they're in the bar. He lets
   anyone in during the day while he's cleaning up. At night, he serves
   milk and the delicious Chateau Romani, but he's short on shipments
   now.

-SCHEDULE-
     Days 1-3, Day -      Location: Milk Bar
                          Activity: Preparing for Night
     Days 1-3, 9:00 PM -  Location: Milk Bar
                          Activity: Locks Bar to Get Ready
     Days 1-3, 10:00 PM - Location: Milk Bar
                          Activity: Opens Bar
     Days 1-3, 6:00 AM -  Location: Milk Bar
                          Activity: Closes Bar


======LINK-GORO======
PROFESSION: Unknown
HOME: Snowhead
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Anju 
OTHER RELATIONS: None
ADDITIONAL INFO: Link-goro is a Goron who visits Clock Town in anticipation for 
the Carnival of Time. He has a reservation at the Inn.
 *NOTE: Link-goro may very likely have a different name in your game. 
   His name is the exact same as your character. So why the "goro"? 
   To distinguish him from Link, I'm putting his name this way because
   this is the way he says it (he adds "goro" onto everything). 

-SCHEDULE-
     Day 1, 4:00 -  Location: Stock Pot Inn 
                    Activity: Checking In
     Day 1, Night - Location: East Clock Town
                    Activity: Sleeping (outside if room is taken)


======TWIN JUGGLERS======
PROFESSION: Jugglers for the Gorman Troupe
HOME: Unknown
CHARACTER RELATIONS: Gorman, Rosa Sisters, Guru-Guru 
OTHER RELATIONS: None
ADDITIONAL INFO: Twins and entertainers of the Gorman Troupe. They 
   practice juggling all day, and love to tell jokes... as stupid as 
   they may be (the jokes, not them... no wait, maybe them too). 
   Surprisingly, they're the  second pair of twins in the Gorman
   Troupe, the Rosa Sisters being the other pair. They are quite happy
   despite the moon overhead.

-SCHEDULE-
     Days 1-2, Day -   Location: East Clock Town
                       Activity: Juggling Outside
     Days 1-2, Night - Location: East Clock Town
                       Activity: Playing Cards in Stock Pot Inn Room
     Day 3, All Day -  Location: Unknown
                       Activity: Left After Show Was Cancelled

     I've packed all the other stuff in here, such as how to contact me, some 
Frequently Asked questions from readers (hey, a question you have could be 
there), credits and a hint of what's to come, and finally a closing statement to 
finish up the FAQ.


                 ----- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ----- 

     Here's a list of questions I'm asked frequently (hence the title). There's 
a good chance that if you have a question, it might be here. Take a look, you 
might not be as stupid and different from others as you think.

Q: What does completing the Bombers' Notebook do?
A: At the end of the game, you will see certain segments added on to the normal 
fare based on how many people you help out. The more people you help out, the 
more you will see happily celebrating during the ending sequence.



                     ----- CLOSING/CONTACT INFO ----- 
     
CONTACT INFO:                 
Have some questions about the game? Comments about my FAQ? Something I left out? 
Info that I got wrong? If there's something you need to know or say about my 
FAQ, be sure to: 

E-mail me Questions or Comments- croco64@yahoo.com

Before you send me stuff, however, make sure you read this first:

1. Please look at the walkthrough before you send me questions! I made the 
walkthrough for a reason. It was so you could look at it, not so you could find 
my e-mail address and ask me what you want to know before you glance at it. Be 
sure to check the walkthrough to see if it can answer your question(s) before 
asking me.

2. When e-mailing me, put the words "Majora's Mask: Bombers", "MM: Bombers' 
Notebook", "MM: Bombers", or similar phrasing into the title. That would help me 
a lot.

3. If you wish to ask me a question, do not send in questions regarding things 
other than the Bombers' Notebook. There are plenty of good FAQs out there with 
talented authors who can answer your questions. However, questions related to 
the Bombers' Notebook are welcome. 
Examples: Good- "An item I need to complete an event costs more than the maximum 
capacity in my wallet. Where can I find a bigger wallet?" 
Bad- "How do you beat the boss of the first dungeon?"

4. If you wish to contribute, please send any information regarding an alternate 
way to complete an event (whether easier or harder) that I missed. Also, I would 
be very happy if you sent corrections to any information I post. For example, if 
I say a character appears somewhere at 6:00 but they really come at 7:00, I'd be 
very happy if you corrected me.

Help Wanted: If you find any errors, either typos or incorrect information 
(especially in the schedules), e-mail me and I'd be ever so happy!

Special Thanks to:
*Nintendo: For this excellent game.  
*The Game: For some of the info I've gotten (Descriptions, mainly) and the 
incredibly-fun Bombers' Notebook.
*Nintendo Power: The Clock Town Map assisted me somewhat in creating mine.
*Majora's Mask Message Board: Some of the kind users there helped me with a 
couple basic questions (no, I completed the entire notebook myself, if you were 
wondering). 
*Frodo86: For the Bunny Hood trick with the Postman.
*Shigmiya64: For telling me how to prevent losing life while detonating the 
Blast Mask

                          - CLOSING STATEMENT -
 
     Thanks for reading. Hmm... that was pretty quick. Guess I'd better extend 
it more. OK. This was a very fun project for me, and I hope that you had a fun 
and informative time reading it. OK, that's good enough. Bye, readers.
