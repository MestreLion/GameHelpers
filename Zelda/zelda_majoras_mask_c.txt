01. Introduction

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••


Welcome to my Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask FAQ/Walkthrough (has a nice ring
to it, don't-cha think?) If you liked the previous Zelda game on the Nintendo
64, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, then you will adore this game. If you hated the
previous Zelda game, then well, you'll most likely hate this game too. ;)
But of course, miracles can happen, and you might enjoy this gem, but I doubt
it. Anyways, I recommend this game to all adventure/RPG fans out there,
especially those of you who own a Nintendo 64. This is one of the last, great
games for the dying system...until Game Cube is released! Woo Hoo!

    | If you have any questions about Zelda: MM™, PLEASE check the        |
    | Walkthrough first (use Crtl + F to help you...), and then please    |
    | check the FAQ Section, because maybe your question can be answered  |
    | there. If then you STILL cannot find the answer to your question,   |
    | then e-mail me. But a word of warning: If your question CAN be found|

  will remove it.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Got ahold of a copy of the game today. I began some of the sections, but
  most importantly, the Walkthrough. I'll probably be focused on the walk-
  through at first, then concentrate on the rest of the sections, sorta like
  I did with my Chrono Cross FAQ. But of course, I will add stuff to the other
  sections if I come across it, but those sections won't hold all of my
  attention until I get the walkthrough complete.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Version 0.012 (09/26/00)

                         In the land of Hyrule, there
                        echoes a legend. A legend held
                        dearly by the Royal Family that
                               tells of a boy...


                                  A boy who,
                        after battling evil and saving
                       Hyrule, crept away from that land
                         that had made him a legend...


                         Done with the battles he once
                        waged across time, he embarked
                          on a journey. A secret and
                              personal journey...


                           A journey in search of a
                       beloved and invaluable friend...


                         A friend with whom he parted
                      ways when he finally fulfilled his
                       heroic destiny and took his place
                               among legends...

05. Game Basics

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••


Control Stick: The control stick controls Link, and the direction that you
               want him to move. Since it's an analog stick, the speed that
               he moves depends on the amount of pressure you put on the
               stick itself. It also controls what direction you wish to
               aim something, or the direction you wish to look in the
               First-Person view.


Jumping: This can be done by simply pressing forward on the control stick, and
         by having Link running at full speed. When Link reaches the end of
         a ledge or edge, he will automatically jump. The longer you run, and
         the faster you run, the farther Link will jump.


Swimming: This too can be controlled with the control stick, and you can also
          control the speed in which you swim. To dive, you must hold down the
          A button, and to swim even faster, press the B button.


A button: This is the action button. This is the blue icon at the top of your
          screen, and controls what actions you can do. The text appearing
          on the icon changes depending on what Link is doing, and where he
          is standing, and it tells what Link can do at a certain time.
          Some of the actions include:

          Grab: Up/Down + A
          Drop: A while hanging from a ledge.
          Throw/Place: Up + A, after grabbing with the A button.
          Open: Press A in front of a door/gate.
          Speak: Press the A button near someone, or while somebody is
                 highlighted with Z-Targeting.
          Check: Press the A button in front of a sign, or after you have
                 targeted it with Z-Targeting.


	  The A button also does some battle actions, like:

          Jump Attack: Z + A after drawing your sword
          Back Flip: Z + Down + A
          Side Jump: Z + Left/Right + A
          Roll Attack: Up + A


B button: This is the attack button. You can perform various attacks with
          this button. Some of the attacks include:

          Vertical Swing: Z or Up + B
          Horizontal Swing: B, or Z + Left/Right + B
          Stab: Z + Up + B
          Spin Attack: 360 degrees with Control Stick + B, or hold B, then
                       release it.


R Trigger: This is the defend button. Pressing it will raise Link's shield.


Z-Trigger: This is the all-important Z-Targeting feature. This allows Link
           to lock onto any target, and NEVER lose sight of this target.
           This is great for battles, and fast moving enemies. While in
           Z-Targeting mode, Link will attack/check/speak to whatever
           is targeted.


C-Buttons: These buttons are able to hold any three items/weapons during
           gameplay. You may assign an item to one of the 3 C-Buttons (all
           except C-Up, which is the First-Person view) by accessing the
           item-select screen.


C-Up Button: First-Person view. This allows Link to look anywhere in First-
             Person view, but he cannot attack while in this mode, nor can
             he move or walk.


Saving your Game: There are two ways to save your game in Majora's Mask.
                  One way is to play the Song of Time, which will save
                  your game for you, but will also return Link to the
                  First Day of the 3-day sequence, meaning that all of
                  your not-so-special items (Rupees, Deku Nuts, etc...)
                  will be lost. The other way to save your game is to
                  use an Owl Statue. This is the same way as you saved
                  your game in Z:OoT, in that when you use a Owl Statue
                  to save, everything, including your position in the
                  game, will be saved. The downside? Well, if you save
                  your game, quit, then boot it back up again and
                  forget to save your game again after that, your game
                  will NOT be saved, and you cannot start your game
                  again from the Owl Statue; you will have to start
                  your game from the last time you used the Song of
                  Time. So basically, the Owl Statue is a short but
                  sweet way to save your game, but it's just a one-
                  time deal, that is, until you use another Owl Statue
                  later on to save your game. ;)

 000: Characters
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Link:

The main character in Zelda: Majora's Mask. He's been the childhood hero for
the past 4 Zelda games on all of the Nintendo systems, and has always
conquered the evil forces, and this game is no different. He is the main
protagonist in the game, and you will play as him for the entire game
(well, 99% of it...).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skull Kid:

One of the other main characters in Zelda: Majora's Mask, the Skull Kid has
stolen the Majora's Mask from the Happy Mask Dealer, and has become very
evil. Not much is known about the Skull Kid, except that he's been almost
"hypnotized" by Majora's Mask, and can't control himself...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy Mask Dealer:

Returning from Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the Happy Mask dealer is the guy who
owns the Majora's Mask, and has asked you to get it back for him before
the 3 days end, and the moon comes crashing down to Termina. He has all
kinds of masks, including a Mario look-alike mask. Too bad you can't get
this mask...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anju:

She's the owner of the Stock Pot Inn, and is very forgetting, and is quick
to apologize. She's not too bright, but she has good intentions. She was
supposed to marry Kafei, but something has stopped her from doing so.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kafei:

He hides out in the back entrance of the Curiosity Shop, and always wears
the Keaton Mask to hide his childhood form that the Skull Kid has cursed
him with. He was supposed to marry Anju on the day after the Final Day, but
this blockade has delayed the wedding indefinately. You must find a way
to help him out of this predicament...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gorman:

He's the youngest sibling of the Gorman Brothers who run the Gorman Race Track,
and he's a very sad man. He's jealous of his older brother, and can't find
anything to cheer him up...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dampe:

He's the gravedigger underneath the Ikana Graveyard, and he returns from
Ocarina of Time, but this time, he's SLOWER than ever. You must help him
find the secret buried treasure underground, and help him find where he
should dig.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Koume:

One of the witches returning from Ocarina of Time (half of Twinrova, a boss in
Ocarina of Time), Koume is stuck inside of the Woods of Mystery. If you help
her, she'll give you a free ride on her Swamp Boat Cruise. She runs the
cruise, so talk to her to get a ride whenever you want to.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Owl:

He also returns from Ocarina of Time, the Owl doesn't appear as much in
Majora's Mask that much, but when he does appear, he'll give you helpful
advice, and even lead you to special items that could not be reached without
him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Romani:

Romani is the ranch girl at the Romani Ranch, and was named after the ranch
itself by her father. Her father passed away a few years back, and since
then, she's had to struggle with keeping up the Ranch, and even had to
protect her beloved cows from UFOs at night...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cremia:

Cremia is the older sister of Romani at the Romani Ranch, and is responsible
for taking care of the cows who provide the precious Chateau Romani Milk
that they sell to the Milk Bar in Clock Town, and she is the girl who
delivers it, and is responsible for delivering the milk safely to the
Milk Bar. If she can't deliver the shipment of Chateua Romani, then
who knows what will happen to the future of Romani Ranch, and Cremia herself.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Postman:

This guy also returns from Ocarina of Time (he was the Hyrule Field runner
guy who you gave the Bunny Hood to in the long trading sequence in Ocarina
of Time...he was also the guy who you had to race with starting at Gerudo
Valley...and never could beat). He still looks the same as before, only
this time, he has the Postman's Hat which gives him the responsibility
of the Official Mail Carrier in Clock Town. This new-found responsibility
has made him very serious about his job, and he'll do anything for
the sake of delivering the mail, and even gets grumpy if you try to
talk to him while he's training and/or busy delivering or picking up
the mail. If only there was a way to help him gain his freedom, and
release him from the chains of the man...

 001. The Beginning

===============================================================================

§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

                         • Mysterious Forest/Dungeon •

§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

You  begin the game in an abandoned field, right after some moron stole
Epona  and  your  Ocarina  of  Time! Well, he's run into a tree, so you
should  give chase, but before doing so, chop up the bushes around here
to  go  Rupee  Hunting! Yeah, try to collect as many Rupees as you can,
then enter the hole in the tree that the Skull Kid rode into.


You'll come into another forest area, but this time there are some tree
stumps  conviently  placed  so you can hop from stump-to-stump and into
the  tree  ahead  of  you.  Before  doing so, however, slash one of the
plants  on  the  ground  here,  and  you  will  find  that these plants
are...alive! Yes, when you slash at one of them, the others will spring
to  life,  and  start  moving around in circles. You can slash them for
some  Rupees,  but  if  you get too close, they will just sink into the
ground. When you are ready, hop from stump to stump, and into the green
hole in the tree.


On the other side, Link will automatically fall into an abyss, and land
on top of a Deku Plant of some sort, and will meet the Skull Kid. After
the cinema, you will have turned into Deku Link, and will be stuck with
one of the Skull Kid's fairies. Now you have to find a way through that
door.  Oh wait, it's already unlocked! Okay, now head through the door,
and  into  the hallway, and into the next room to activate a cut-scene.
The  fairy  intro-  duces itself to you, and it's name is Tatl. She (or
he)  says  that  she will join you until they find that Skull Kid. Step
onto  the  Deku  Flower  to  learn a good lesson from Tatl. Now you can
either  use the Deku Flower in front of you to fly across the gorge and
to the next door, or you can just hop down and collect some more Rupees
from  the  plants,  then use a Deku Flower to get back to the top, then
glide to the other door.


On  the  other  side,  use  the Deku Flower to glide to the platform in
front  of  you,  then use this Deku Flower here to glide up to the next
platform,  the  one  with the small chest on it. Open the chest here to
get  some  Deku Nuts. Now fly back to the original Deku Flower near the
door. At this Deku Flower, turn to the right of the door to see a ledge
in the distance. This is your goal for where to land next. Use the Deku
Flower here, and glide all the way to this ledge. You should be able to
make  it  with ease. Check out what Tatl has to say, then glide over to
the next ledge, the one with the tree. Check out the tree and what Tatl
has to say, then enter the next doorway.


Inside  this  next factory place, head up the ramp and past the turning
wheel,  and at the top, you will meet the Happy Mask Dealer. He'll tell
you  that  he  will return you to your normal state if you get back his
stolen mask, the one that the Skull Kid stole from him, as well as your
Ocarina.  He says you only have 3 days to get it back to him, before he
leaves this area. So, head through the doors to enter South Clock Town.


===============================================================================

 002. Hey! That's my Ocarina!

§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

                                • Clock Town •

§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

In  Clock  Town,  there are different regions, like North, South, East,
and  West Clock Town. You want to head to North Clock Town, because you
must  find  the Great Fairy (that's what Tatl tells you to do anyways),
so  from the start, turn right, and head up the ramps to the doorway at
the  top,  and  head  into North Clock Town to find a kid shooting at a
balloon  with his Blow Gun, and Tingle, another forest person who draws
maps  for  a living. He'll get all excited to see your Fairy, and would
like  to  become your friend, so buy a map from him. Buy the Clock Town
Map  for  5  Rupees,  and if you have the cash, the Woodfall Map for 40
Rupees.


Okay,  now  run  past  the  kid  shooting at the balloon, and go up the
ramps, past the Deku Flower and into the next doorway to find the Great
Fairy. You will see that the Skull Kid has broken her into many pieces,
so  you'll  have  to  find the single lost Fairy in town somewhere. Use
your  map,  and  head  back  into  South  Clock  Town, then head to the
south-west  area  on  your  map,  and enter Laundry Pool. Check out the
Fairy  above  the water, and grab it, then return it to the Great Fairy
in North Clock Town.


She'll  turn  back  into  normal  form and, hot damn! She's hotter than
ever! Whew. Anyways, she'll grant you some Magic Power, and tell you to
speak  to  the  man  in the observatory outside of town. Exit the Fairy
Fountain, and use your bubbles to blow up the balloon where the kid is.
He'll  ask you if you want to pass his test to get the password for the
Observatory,  so  agree.  You have to find him and his 4 friends before
the  next  day.  There  are two of them here already. One is behind the
tree  near  the  mailbox,  and the other is up the hill, behind a wall.
Chase them both when they run away, then capture them.


The  other  two  are  to the east of here, through the doorway near the
mailbox.  One  is  on  the  roof  with a chicken, so when he flies off,
follow  him and chase him to capture him. The other one is on the straw
roof, so find the Deku Flower, and glide up to him and capture him. Now
head  to  the  west  side  of Clock Town, to West Clock Town. He's just
standing  there,  so  grab  him,  and  he'll give you the code which is
random. There is  a random  code for their  hideout in East Clock Town.
Return to  the  area of  town to the  right of  the mailbox (East Clock
Town), and tell the small kid the password, and he'll let you in.


Go  into the hideout, down the stone ramp, and hop into the water. Kill
the  Big  Skulltula towards the end of the area, then in the next room,
shoot  the  balloon with a bubble, then climb the ladder, and enter the
colorful  room  with the Scarecrow. Climb the colorful stairs and speak
with the old guy.


Look  through his telescope, and zoom in on the Skull Kid just ahead of
you,  and  watch  the  cinema. After it ends, exit the observatory, and
take  the  Moon's  Tear from outside the door. Return to the East Clock
Town, then to South Clock Town. Now run down the ramp, and approach the
gold Deku Flower to meet a Deku Scrub who wants the Moon's Tear. Set it
to a C Button, then give it to him in exchange for the Land Title Deed.
Now  after  he  flies  off, use the golden Deku Flower, and aim for the
giant  clock-thing  behind  you. There is a Heart Piece here, so fly on
the ledge and take it.


Now  go  back  to  North  Clock  Town, and find the slide. Climb up the
slide,  and turn to your left to spot a Heart Piece on top of the tree.
Use  the  platforms  to  make  your way to the tree, and take the Heart
Piece.  *NOTE:  You  can  only  get this Heart Piece by using the Bunny
Hood, which can be accessed later on in the game. Remember to come back
here with the Bunny Hood.


Now just wait until Midnight of the 3rd day for the Clock Tower door to
open in South Clock Town. Fly up to the Clock Tower ledge, and wait for
Midnight  of  the Final day to come. When it does, a cinema will occur,
and  a  fireworks  show  will dazzle you...or not. Either way, when the
stairs  on  the  Clock Tower emerge, climb them to mee the Skull Kid on
top of the Clock Tower.


When  he's  done  talking, shoot him once with a bubble, and he'll drop
the Ocarina. Take it, and watch the flashbacks of Princess Zelda. Learn
the song, the Song of Time, then when you return to your fight with the
Skull  Kid,  set  the Ocarina to a C button, and play the Song of Time,
and save and return to the 1st day.


Enter  the  Clock  Tower  through the doors at the bottom, and meet the
Happy  Mask  Dealer.  Talk  to  him,  and  he'll  teach you the Song of
Healing.  This  will cause the mask to fall off of Link. The Happy Mask
Dealer  will now give you the Deku Mask as a memento! Okay, now head to
the  bomber's  hideout  in  East  Clock  Town,  enter  it  and make the
scarecrow  turn  time ahead, then exit the hideout. On the way out, the
bomber  kid will hand you the Bomber's Notebook! Cool. Wait around here
until  midnight,  then  run  to  North  Clock  Town to spot an old lady
walking  around.  A robber will come running by and steal her purse, so
hit  him before he can run away, and the lady will be so happy with you
helping  her,  that  she  will give you the Blast Mask for your effort!
Take  this,  then  head south to the Laundry Pool area (where you found
the  single  fairy  earlier),  and  you will find the song-man with his
instrument,  sitting on a log. Talk to him, and eventually you will get
the  Bremen  Mask  from  him!  Okay, now let time pass until it becomes
morning  again, and when it is 10AM, head to East Clock Town, and enter
the  Mayor's  Residence.  Go through the door on the right, and talk to
the  fish  lady,  then  to  the  human  lady. Agree to help her (answer
"yes"), and you will get Kafei's Mask from the lady.


When  you  are  all  ready to go, wait until midnight of the Final Day,
then  head  south of South Clock Town, and exit into Termina Field. Can
you   hear  that?  In  the  background,  it's...it's.....CLASSIC  ZELDA
TUNES!!!!!!!!!! Woo Hoo!!! Yeah baby, there are now classic Zelda songs
playing in the background of Termina Field. Ahh, the memories. ;) Well,
anyways,  continue  to  the  south  at around midnight, and run forward
until  you  reach  the  tree with a drawing on it. This will activate a
cut-scene  about the two Fairies and the Skull Kid, and it shows how he
got ahold of the Majora's Mask in the first place...


Okay,  now  be  sure  to  have  the  Bremen Mask equipped to one of the
C-Buttons,  then  check  out  the  sign  near the tree, which points to
Romani  Ranch.  Follow  the sign, and enter Milk Road. Run forward, and
follow  Milk  Road all the way to Romani Ranch. If you wish, you can go
there  on  the  first  day,  then  stand  near the guy who is trying to
unblock  the path to the ranch, then play the Song of Double Time until
you  reach  the  dawn of the Final Day, when he will be done unblocking
the path. Now enter the Romani Ranch.


Veer  to  the  right, and you will spot Epona locked up. Enter the barn
that is behind Epona, and has some chicken drawings on the front of it,
and speak with the man near the tree. Put on the Bremen Mask, and march
around  the place, collecting the 10 tiny, yellow chicks. Once you have
them  all,  they  will grow into normal chickens, and the man will give
you the Bunny Hood! Go back to Clock Town, and find the mailman, who is
running  around  town.  NOTE: You might have to return to the first day
again, because time is probably running out by now...


On  your  way  back,  run  in the tall grass just past the Milk Road in
Termina Field, and run around the area with the flying butterflies, and
you  should fall into a hole. If it is daytime, then fight the Pea Pod,
and take the Heart Piece from inside of the chest! If it is night-time,
kill  the  3 flying razor pods that come out of the sleeping Pea Pod if
you  slash  at it with your sword. Return to Clock Town, and search for
the  mailman  who  is running around. Once you find him, follow him and
after a while, he'll enter the Post Office, so follow him in there too.
He'll leave, so continue to follow him wherever he goes. This is a good
way  to  add more and more people to your Notebook too. Once he returns
to  the  post office again and he's training on his bed, play his game.
You'll have to stop the timer at exactly 10 seconds. If you mess up and
want to try again, it will cost you 2 Rupees, but if you want to cheat,
just  exit,  then  re-enter the post office to play again for free. You
will  get  a Heart Piece if you can get the timer to stop on exactly 10
seconds, but be warned, this is a tough task.


Before you head to Woodfall Swamp, be sure to get the Woodfall Map from
Tingle in North Clock Town. After getting it, head out the western exit
of  Clock  Town,  run  past  that tree with the drawing on it, and into
Woodfall Swamp.

Find the large black tree near the hole in the ground, and kill the bat
that  is above it using a bubble as Deku Link, then climb to the top to
find  an  easy  Heart Piece! Now head into the Southern Swamp area, and
climb the ladder to the house, and give the Land Title Deed to the Deku
Scrub,  take  the  Swamp Title Deed, then use the Deku Flower to launch
yourself  onto  the  roof,  and  take  the Heart Piece here! Follow the
lilypads  down  to the left of this hut, and at the end, enter the next
area.  In  this area, run behind the large hut on stilts, and enter the
Woods of Mystery.


Here  you  will  find a cute little monkey. Put your Bunny Hood on, and
talk  to  him.  He'll tell you to follow him, so do so. At the end, you
will  find  Koume (she's one of the witches from OoT, of Twinrova). She
needs  some  help,  so  leave  the  Woods  of Mystery, and re-enter the
Southern Swamp, and exit the Woods of Mystery.


Right when you exit, you will see another witch fly out of her hut, and
fly into the Woods of Mystery (aka Lost Woods from OoT...). Return back
into  the  Woods,  and  follow the monkey again, and along the way, you
will  meet the other witch. Talk to her, and she'll give you the Bottle
of Red Potion! Now exit the Woods to return to the Southern Swamp, then
re-enter  the Woods, and follow the monkey once more to the other witch
who  needs the Red Potion. If you accidentally drink it yourself (don't
ask...), then just return to the hut and get some more Red Potion.


The  directions are (to get to the witch):

Day 1: Left, Right, Right, Straight, Left, Left
Day 2: Right, Left, Straight, Left, Left, Right
Day 3: Straight, Left, Right, Right, Straight, Right

Now talk  to her, and when she mentions the C-Buttons, take out the Red
Potion  which  should  be  on  a C-Button, and give it to her. Koume is
revived!  Now  she'll  take you on a Free Swamp ride whenever you wish.
Now  leave  the  Woods  once again. Follow the 3 Monkeys outside of the
Woods  back  into the first area with the Deku Flower near the hut, and
enter  this  hut.  Now talk to Kotake inside of the Tourist Information
booth, and she'll give you the Photograph Box (Camera).


Set  the  Camera to a C-Button, and get ready for your Swamp Ride! When
the  boat  stops,  and they ask you if you would like to stop at Deku's
Palace,  say  yes.  Put  the  Deku  Mask on, and follow the monkey into
Deku's Palace.

Talk  to the Deku Scrubs in your way in front of you, then run straight
past  them  and  into the Royal Chamber. Take a photo of the Deku King,
then  walk  up  to  him and talk to him. He says that they are about to
punish  the  foolish  monkey who kidnapped the Deku princess! Go up and
talk  to  the  monkey  in the cage, then exit this room. The monkey out
here will tell you that there is a secret entrance to the cage, but you
need  a Magic Bean from the Magic Bean seller. Enter the right door (or
left  one), and make your way through the maze, until you reach a hole.
Drop  into  it,  and buy some Magic Beans from the seller. Also, search
throughout the maze to find a Heart Piece! By the way, the hole you are
looking  for  is  near a set of torches, if that makes it any easier to
find...


The  Seller  will  give you one free sample, so use it wisely. Exit the
hole,  and go back outside to the lilypads. Hop across the lilypads out
here to get to the other side of this area, and along the way, you will
find  a  small  island with a Deku Flower on it. Use it to launch up to
the  ledge here, and enter the next area. Use all of these Deku Flowers
to  fly from pad to pad, until you get to the last one. Now fly over to
the ledge with the blue stone on it, and talk to the Owl. Now check out
the stone, and you will lear the Song of Soaring!


Return  back down to the ground, and head left from the entrance to the
Royal  Chamber, and you will see a sign pointing to the Outer Area near
a  lilypad. Follow the lilypads to the next patch of land, and you will
find  a  soft-soil  spot.  Plant  a magic bean leaf here, then wait for
either  the second day to come for it to rain, or use a bottle of water
on it to make it grow. When it does grow, hop onto the leaf.


Follow  the  ledge  to the first of many Deku Flowers, and use these to
fly  to the next Flower, and so on. Along the way, kill the Deku Scrubs
who  attack  and  are  in  your way. At the end of this annoying flying
game, is the trapped monkey. Talk to him, hit the pole with your sword,
turn  into  Deku  Link, then take our your Ocarina to learn a new song,
the Sonata of the Awakening! Now return back to the Tourist Center, and
talk  to the rather large man here, and show him your photo of the King
Deku,  and  he will give you a Heart Piece! Now take the boat ride back
to the Deku Palace area. Return to the ledge where you learned the Song
of Soaring, then glide over to the next ledge, and enter Woodfall.

Start  off  by going right, and across the water and onto the platform.
Use  the platform, and go to the top of it, and kill the enemies on the
way.  At  the  top,  use  the  Deku  Flower, and glide over to the next
platform,  up  the  ramp,  then  glide  over  to  the little gazzebo or
whatever  it is. It should have an Owl Statue here, so activate it. Now
stand  on  the  Deku  platform,  and play the Sonata of Awakening. This
opens  up the Woodfall Temple! But before you enter it, look behind the
Owl  Statue  to see a chest on a platform. Glide over here and open the
chest  to  find a blue Rupee. Make your way back to the center platform
with  the  Owl  Statue,  then  use the Deku Flower to glide over to the
entrance to the Woodfall Temple.

Once inside, you will see a jar in front of you. This holds a fairy, so
catch it inside of a jar if you wish, then take off your Deku Mask, and
put  on  the Great Fairy Mask. This will attract that pink little fairy
in  front  of  you,  and will become your first fairy found in the game
(there  are  15  total fairies inside each dungeon, and they can all be
attracted  using the Great Fairy Mask). Now go back into Deku Link, and
use  the  Deku  Flower here to fly to the next platform with the second
Deku  Flower  on  it,  then face eastward, and fly to the lone platform
with  the  chest  on  it. Open the chest to find Stray Fairy #2 in this
temple.


Now  make  your way across the platforms to the north, and head through
the  door  at  the  end. Kill the Deku Plant to your left, run down the
ramp  to  the bottom, then kill the next Deku Plant down here to reveal
the  3rd Stray Fairy here. Hop across the venus fly traps in the water,
and  go across to the other side of you, until you reach a door that is
unlocked.  Now  turn right, and head to the lone platform with a lot of
jars  on it. Inside one of the jars is another stray fairy, so take it,
then return to the door, and head through it.


Hop on the fly traps again in this room, and to the center Deku Flower.
Use it to fly off to the right ledge that has the chest on it. Open the
chest  to  find  a Small Key! Now head through the next door. After the
doors  lock  on you, you will have to kill the 3 razor-turtles in here.
To  do this, dive inside of the Deku Flowers, and wait for them to come
running  across the top of you, then launch yourself in the air to kill
them.  Now  that  they  are  gone,  a chest will appear, containing the
Dungeon Map, and the doors will become unlocked. Remember where you got
Fairy  #2  in  the first room, the one near the locked door? Good. Head
back there, and unlock the door with your key, and enter it.


Run forward, and push the block out of your way, and go right to find a
Big Skulltula. Kill it, and get the next stray fairy #5. Continue along
the path, and push the block out of your way, back towards the entrance
to  this  room,  then take the right path to find a un-lit torch near a
locked  door. Turn into normal Link, and put on the Bunny Hood, light a
Deku  Stick  on  the  torch near Fairy #5 was, then run it back to this
torch  and  light it to open the next door. Now enter the door after it
unlocks for you.


Inside  here,  kill  the  Dragonflies  the  same  way  you did with the
razor-turles  in  the  Dungeon Map room, and then take the Compass from
the  chest.  Leave the room. Turn back to normal Link, put on the Bunny
Hood,  and  light  a  Deku Stick, and run up the stairs here. Light the
torch  here,  then light your Deku Stick again with this torch, and hop
across the platforms to the spiderwebs, and burn them away. Head up the
stairs  here,  and  kill  all  of the little invisible creatures on the
ground,  enter  the next room, and kill them all until a chest appears.
Take  the fairy from the chest, then light a Deku Stick with the center
torch,  and  run  around the outside of this room to light the 3 un-lit
torches and open the next door. Enter it.


In  here, use the Deku Flowers to get across the gaps, and to the other
side  of  the  room. You can either kill or ignore the Dragonflies, but
either  way, be sure to get to the other side safely. Enter the doorway
on  the  other  side,  go  down the stairs, and enter the large room as
normal  Link.  Step on the floor switch in front of you, and watch as 2
ladders  appear.  Head  through the door near the switch first, then go
right and enter the door at the end to fight a boss (well, sorta).

There is only one Dinalfo in this fight, so that make it pretty easy to
win.  He  has  some Iron armor on, which makes it harder to attack him,
and  he  usually dodges your attacks with a backflip. He can also shoot
fire  at  you,  which  you cannot defend against, so stay back from him
when he does this. It's best to attack right after he has attacked you,
and  after  he has backflipped. A few hits, or 2-3 jumping slashes will
take him down.


After  the  fight,  the  door  will  become  unlocked, and a chest will
appear.  What's  in  it?  The  Hero's Bow of course! Exit the room, and
equip your Hero's Bow. Now aim for the eye that is across the room, and
shoot  it  to make a platform rise in the center of the room. Turn into
Deku Link and glide over to the platform, then to the other side. Enter
the door to fight another battle.

This  guy is annoying as hell. Start off by playing as normal Link, and
attack  him  a  few  times, until he summons his large razor turle. Now
turn  into  Deku Link, and find a Deku Flower. Dive in it, and wait for
the turtle to come across the top of you, then launch up to knock Gekko
off. Now Gekko will climb the walls, so return to normal Link, and wait
for  him to stop, and shoot him with an arrow. He'll then return to his
razor-turtle,  so turn back to Deku Link, and repeat this process until
he  dies  off,  and  turns into a small frog, and two doors unlock, one
containing the boss key chest.


Take  the  boss  key, then leave the room. Stand near the floor switch,
and shoot an arrow through the fire, and to the center torch inside the
large  center  flower.  Now go right, and you will find a bubble with a
Stray  Fairy  inside it, so pop it, and take Fairy #7. Now hop onto the
large spinnig flower, and aim for the unlit torch on a lone platform in
a  corner  of  the  room,  and  shoot an arrow through the torch on the
flower  you  are on, and to the unlit torch to open the next door. Head
through this door.


Inside here, hop down to the Deku Flower near the ladder, and use it to
glide over to the ledge with the Fairy Bubble to the left of the ladder
(if you are facing it). Take Fairy #8, then look ahead to see a crystal
switch.  Shoot  it  with an arrow to lower the flames blocking the boss
door.  Now  go  to the other side of the ladder to find Fairy #9 on the
ledge  here,  and  look  up to your right to see another Fairy inside a
bubble,  up  on  the ledge. Get this one too, using the Deku Flowers to
fly up to it. Now shoot the crystal switch again to lower the fire, and
use  the  Deku Flower to fly to the center platform where another stray
fairy  is,  and take it, then continue to fly over to the platform near
it, where another Deku Flower is. Use this one to launch up to the Deku
Flower  on  the roof of a small platform is above you, then fly over to
the boss door, and enter it using your Boss Key.

Whoa  nelly!  This  guy sure does look cool, but beware, he's a pain in
the  ass at times. He mainly attacks you with his sword, so avoid those
attacks,  then  strike  his legs several times with your sword. After a
while,  he'll  call  out  some  spiders.  Kill  these  guys  off,  then
concentrate  on  him.  He'll also surround Link with a ring of fire, so
just  wait  until  this  dies off, and then continue to attack. When he
starts  to  dance  and sing, or when he just stops attacking you, shoot
some  arrows at him to stun him, then come in and attack as much as you
can  with your sword before he starts up again. It's a good idea to use
the  surrounding bomb-flowers as a source of arrows and hearts when you
are  running  low. Always keep your shield up at all times, except when
you  are  attacking, or else you will take some serious damage. When he
calls  in  some bats to surround him and you, just block them with your
shield, and continue your method of attack. After enough damage, Odolwa
goes down.


Take  the  Full  Heart  Container,  then  step inside the portal to get
Odolwa's  Remains. After this, Link will learn the Oath to Order! After
the cinema has ended, you will be outside of a tree containing the Deku
Princess.  Cut  down  the  vines  blocking the door to rescue her, then
capture  her  inside of an empty bottle. Now exit this area, and return
to the Royal Chamber, and release the Princess from the bottle in front
of  the  king.  Watch the funny cut-scene, and the monkey will tell you
about  something  special for you to the right of the outer area of the
Deku  Palace.  Exit to out here, and turn back to normal Link, and swim
right,  and  follow  the  lilypads  around the bend, and enter the Deku
Shrine.


Enter it, and speak to the Deku in here. Race him (or follow him) using
the  Bunny  Hood,  and  after the LONG trip, he'll give you the Mask of
Scents  at  the end of the Shrine! After taking the mask, step into the
Portal  to return to the outside of the Deku Shrine. When you are ready
to  go,  head  back  to  the Tourist Information Center in the Southern
Swamp  area, and speak with Kotake in there. Take the boat ride, and on
the  way,  you will be allowed to play her mini-game. There is a target
on  the  back  of the boat (Kotake actually has the target on her broom
and  she's  following the boat), and your goal is to hit the targets at
least 20 times. If you hit Kotake more than 10 times, you lose. Hit the
targets  20  times or more, and Kotake will give you a Heart Piece! The
game is 10 Rupees to play if you lose the first time, so be ready...


This  Heart  Piece  is  on  a  platform  to the left of the entrance to
Woodfall  Swamp.  First,  head  over to the Owl Statue that is near the
entracne  to the Woodfall Temple, then use the Deku Flower here and fly
to  the  north,  and  to the next Deku Flower. Be sure to kill the Deku
Scrubs  as you go too. Continue to fly from platform to platform, until
you  reach a platform with a large chest on top (the platform should be
near the entrance). Open the chest, and you will find a Heart Piece!

===============================================================================

Now  return to Clock Town (just warp there by using the Song of Soaring
to  save time and effort!). Once back in Clock Town, head to East Clock
Town,  and locate the Shooting Gallery in this area. Head in there, and
pay  20  Rupees  to  play.  Your goal is to hit as many Red Octoroks as
possible,  and  not  to hit any Blue ones while you're at it. Hitting a
blue  one  results  in  a loss of a point, and the record that you will
have to beat the first time is 39 points. It shouldn't be too hard, but
you  only have 1 minute and 15 seconds to do so, so be quick about your
shots,  and  don't  hit any Blue ones! If you beat the record, you will
receive the Large Quiver, which can hold up to 40 arrows! Woo Hoo! Now,
if  you  still haven't done so, be sure to get the Heart Piece from the
Mailman  in  the  Post  Office by playing his training game. If you are
done  with the Clock Town, play the Song of Time to return to the First
Day  (but  remember to deposit any Rupees you have into the bank first,
so that you don't lose any precious Rupees!!!!)


You'll need some more items for your next dungeon, like bombs, so go to
East Clock Town, and locate the Bomb Shop. In here, talk with the Goron
to  learn  about  a  big  bomb that he has that this store doesn't even
carry...hmmm.  Anyways, talk to the Shopkeeper, and purchase a Bomb Bag
for 50 Rupees (it also comes with 20 Bombs! A steal!).


On the first day, waste some time and play some more games in the Clock
Town,  and  at  midnight of the First Day, leave Clock Town through the
northern exit, then run left, following the fence. Eventually, you will
reach  a  man  on top of a large rock, and he's....dancing. o_O Anywho,
talk  to  him,  then play the Song of Healing, and you will recieve the
Kamaro  Mask!  Now  return  East  Clock Town. Find the two brothers (or
sisters)  who  are  dancing  together, and put the mask on. Now talk to
them, and press B to teach them a new dance! They will be so happy that
you have done this, that they will give you a Heart Piece!


Okay,  now  before  you continue on your journey, make your way to Milk
Road,  just  outside  of Termina, and head off to Romain Ranch (be sure
it's  after  1AM  and around 2AM on the First Day, and speak to Romani,
the ranch girl, then follow her into the barn. Now, leave the barn, and
wait  for  the UFOs to come from the sky, and shoot them down with your
Hero's  Bow  until  Dawn  of  the  Second Day, and she'll give you some
Chateau  Romani  inside of a bottle! Okay, now Exit out of the southern
exit  of  Clock  Town,  and run towards the Swamp area. On the way, run
underneath  the rounded tree, and you should feel your Rumble Pak shake
(if  you have one). Stand underneath it, and place a bomb on the ground
to  reveal  this  hole.  Inside,  there  are TONS of plants which yield
Rupees,  Bombs,  Arrows,  etc., as well as 2, count 'em, 2 cows! Yikes!
Use  this  area to stock up on any items you are low on, and to fill up
your empty bottles with nice, healthy milk.


If  you still need some more Heart Pieces, you can find one inside of a
hole  outside  of  the  northern exit of Clock Town, in the snowy area,
just  past  the  ramp you run down, and it's near one of those mushroom
shaped  rocks (like where you got Kamaro's Mask). Inside, there are two
Dodongos.  Concentrate  on one of them first, then the other. To defeat
them,  just wait for them to shoot fire at you, then circle around them
to  their  tales,  attack with a jumping slash, defend with your shield
right  away,  because  they'll  spin  around  and  hit  you  with their
tail,then repeat. After both of them are defeated, you will get a chest
containing  a Heart Piece! Now since you are in this area, you might as
well head off to Snowheed, so run to the right of this hole, and up the
ramp,  then  up the second ramp at the top of this one. At the top, you
are  blocked  by some ice, and Tatl points out a icicle above it. Shoot
it  with  2  arrows  to  cause  the icicle to drop, and shatter the ice
blocking  your  way. Now enter the snowy area, and make your way to the
giant snowballs blocking your path. Bomb 'em with a bomb, then continue
up the path, and into Mountain Village.

Enter  the  village, and speak with the Goron stuck on the ledge to the
left.  He's  very hungry, and has been stuck there for a long time, and
he  needs  help.  Now  look  to the right of this Goron to find the Owl
Statue  for  this area, and hit it to activate it. Now head through the
next path, and into Goron Village.


In  here, shoot Tingle down from the sky, and buy a Snowheed Map for 20
Rupees.  Now  enter  the next area, just beyond Tingle and the bridges.
Run  past  the  next  Goron, and run along the bridge until you see the
real owl near you, then hop down to the lower level, and speak with the
Owl. Now follow him when he tells you to, and use the feathers he drops
to  guide  you  to  the  invisible  platforms.  Be careful, because the
platforms  are  slippery. Now at the end, the Owl will talk to you once
more.  In  this  next shrine, stock up on bombs, then open the chest to
find  the  Lens of Truth! Exit the shrine, and use the Lens of Truth to
see yourself back to the main land, and across the invisible platforms.
On  the other side, you will be able to see a Goron ghost with the Lens
of  Truth on. Now just follow him to all the way back to the first area
you  came  in  through, and into the Mountain Village, and over the icy
platforms, and up the invisible ladder.


At the top, speak to the Goron, then enter the Goron Graveyard. Inside,
speak to the ghost of the Goron, who is Darmani the Third. When he asks
you  to  heal  him,  play the Song of Healing to him. After doing this,
Link  will  receive the Goron Mask! Now use this mask to pull the giant
gravestone  away,  revealing  a bunch of hot water! Go back into normal
Link, fill up a bottle of Hot Water, then exit the Goron Graveyard, and
enter  the  area  with  Tingle  (do  it fast, or the water won't be hot
anymore).  Locate  the giant snowball on the ground that is bigger than
the  rest,  and  hit  it to reveal a frozen Goron. Use the hot water on
her,  then  run  back  up  to the higher-area near the bridge to find a
frozen  over  hole.  Go back to the graveyard and take some more water,
and  un-freeze this hole. Now you have access to another hot-steam pond
inside this hole, which will save you time.


Return  to the area where you meet the owl, and find the closed door on
the  lower  area.  Do the Goron Stomp, which is A + B together, to open
it.

Enter  the  Goron  Shrine.  Head  to the north, and speak to the crying
baby,  then  go back to the old Goron you un-froze. She's frozen again,
so  unfreeze  her once more. Talk to her, and she'll teach you only the
first  part of the Goron's Lullaby, which is the Lullaby Intro! Now run
back to the baby inside of the Goron Shrine, and play the Lullaby Intro
to  it.  The  baby  will  then teach you the second part, and learn the
Goron Lullaby!


Now that everyone is asleep, and the two torches are lit up near the
baby, turn into normal Link with the Bunny Hood, and light a Deku Stick
with one of those torches, and then run around the Goron Shrine, and light
all of the torches here, until the large center chandelier starts to
spin around. Now return to the top of the area, and face the burning
chandelier as Goron Link, and do a Goron Spike roll from the red carpet
and to the burning pots on the chandelier. Break each pot until a
piece of meat falls from one of them. Now pick this up as Goron Link,
and carry it to that starving Goron near the Owl Statue in Mountain
Village. Give him the rock sirloin, and he'll come down to you, and
hand you the Don Gero Mask!

Now  go  back to the hole with the hot water in it, fill up your bottle
with  some,  then  return  to  the large cabin near the owl statue, and
inside,  un-freeze the frozen machine. Now the guys in here can reforge
your  sword for 100 Rupees, but if you use the sword 100 times or more,
it will regain it's old sharpness, and require another reforging. Do so
if  you wish, but as you leave, the guy tells you that if you bring him
some gold dust, he can forge you the strongest of the swords...


I  suggest  that  you  now  play the Song of Time to save your game and
return  to the first day, then play the Song of Soaring to return here,
and  continue  your  journey.  Now,  turn into Goron Link, and use your
newfound  powers  to  continue  your  quest, and to locate the Snowhead
Dungeon.  Take  the  path to the right of the Owl Statue, and enter the
next area. Press A to crouch, then hold forward to gain speed, and jump
across  the  gap.  Continue  doing  this over the 2 gaps, and enter the
Snowhead area.

Once  you  are  here, immediately hit the Owl Statue with your sword as
normal  Link  to activate him, and turn it into a potential warp point.
You  will  also  see a strong wind current that is blowing towards you,
and not letting you enter the next area. Use the Lens of Truth to see a
large  (very  large)  Goron blowing cold air at you to prevent you from
entering. Step closer to him, and as Goron Link, play the Goron Lullaby
to  put  him  to  sleep, and allow access to the next area. By the way,
there  is  a fairy inside of a snowball near the owl statue, so capture
it  inside  of  your  bottle  before moving on. Run up the path, and go
right  to  find a Fairy Temple in the side of the mountain. Continue to
the  right  to  find a large spiral ice ramp. Go up it, dodge the giant
snowballs, and enter the Snowhead Temple.

Kill  the  white shadow creatures, then use your punch to break through
the  ice blocking your path as Goron Link. Now push the large block out
of  your  way, and kill the Wolf in the next room. Enter the right-hand
door.  Inside this next room, do your Goron Roll across the bridge, and
then  launch  yourself  across the gap. Now go back to normal Link, and
hop  over  to  the  door  on  the other ledge, on the other side of the
bridge.


Head  up  the  stairs, and inside the next room is the chest containing
the  Dungeon  Map. Also, there is a stray fairy inside of this room, so
take  it,  then go back to the bridge. Now hop back over the small gap,
and  look underneath the ledge for a fairy inside of a bubble. Shoot an
arrow  through  the  bubble,  then put on the Great Fairy Mask to catch
your second fairy (Fairy #2) in this dungeon.


Now  enter  the  next  doorway  to your left, and run across the center
platform,  and  through the only open door on the other side. Turn left
inside  the  next room, and pull out the two stacked blocks to reveal a
small room containing a small chest. The chest has a small key, so take
it, then exit the room.


Run back across the center platform, and enter the stairway to the left
of  the door you entered this room earlier. Downstairs, turn into Goron
Link, then step on the floor switch to make a chest appear. Open it up,
and  take the Stray Fairy #3. Now return back upstairs. See the iced up
door  near  the  two torches? Shoot an arrow through a torch and to the
ice,  so that it melts it away. Kill the Wolf in here, then use the Key
on  the door to the right. Enter it, and kill the Wolf in here too. Now
open  the  chest to get the Compass. Look over to the dis-colored wall,
and bomb it to reveal a staircase. Take it upstairs.


Aim upward at the icicles above the room here, and shoot some arrows at
them  to  cause  them  to  drop,  and  destroying  the ice covering the
platforms.  Now hop onto the lowest platform as normal link, and hop to
the  platform with the large snowball on it. As Goron Link, crush it to
reveal  a  chest with a small key in it. Now, using your new small key,
enter the locked door.


In  here,  run to the right, and Goron Stomp the first switch, take off
the  mask, go over the platform and to the other side, stomp the switch
that  just  came up, then go back to the platform that you just used to
get  over here to, stomp that, then take off the mask, and climb up the
platform  near  the door, and enter the door before the timer runs out.

With  that over with, enter the door, and curl up as Goron Link. Launch
yourself  over  the  gap, then turn right ASAP, and over the snow. Once
you  are  out  of  the snow, stop rolling, and face the next gap to the
right.  Curl up once more, and get some speed, and launch yourself over
the  next  gap,  and  to  the door on the other side. In here, you will
fight  Wizrobe.  He'll  randomly appear at one of the four outer areas,
and  when  he  starts  to  rotate around, attack him with your sword or
arrows. After enough damage, he'll make copies of himself, so just look
around  until you see the rotating one again, and attack. Do this until
he  dies  off,  and a chest will appear. The Fire Arrows are inside, so
take 'em. Leave the room.


Go back downstairs to the first bridge-gap room with the freezards, and
melt  them  all  with your Fire Arrows. One of them will reveal a small
chest  containing  a  small  key.  Take it, then return to the previous
room, the one with the large platform in the center of it. In here, use
your  Fire Arrows to melt the other 2 doors with ice on them. Now enter
the  green  door right across from you to the north. Melt the Freezards
in  here  to  get a chest with Stray Fairy #4, then light all 3 torches
with  your  Fire  Arrows to open the door across the room. Head through
the door, and turn into Goron Link, and Goron Stomp the switch here.


Exit  this  small  area,  then  return  to the large main room with the
center platform that just rose. Now go right, and through the red door,
hang a left through the next door, fly across the bridge gap with Goron
Link,  then hop across the ledge, and through the stairway to enter the
room  where  you  got  the  Dungeon  Map  earlier.  Stand on the center
platform,  look  up,  and  see  a  Freezard here. Shoot it with an Fire
Arrow,  then  shoot  the iced-over eye switch again with another arrow.
The  platform  will rise. Hop over to the ledge, and exit out the door.
Turn  right,  and  hop  into  the small little cage below the snow, and
climb  up  the ladder at the end, and exit through the stairway to your
right.  Now turn right again, and Goron Roll across the snow, then exit
through the door to the right, after the snow ends.


Kill  the  two  Eenos  in here with some Fire Arrows, turn right of the
doorway,  and melt the ice with your Fire Arrow, then climb the stairs.
Kill  the  two  Dinofols with Goron Link, and they will both yield some
stary  Fairies,  so here are Stray Fairies #5-6 in here. Enter the next
door, run across the platform, and enter the next room to fight Wizrobe
again.  Do the same thing as before to beat him, and be sure to use the
pots  on  the platforms as sources of hears, Magic Bottles, and arrows.
After  the fight, a door opens, so enter it, and take the Boss Key. Now
exit out the door, and head back down to the 2F of the Temple.


See  the  blue  sections  of the giant stone in the center of the room?
Good.  Put on the Goron Mask, and punch the two blue sections away from
the  platform, turn around, and go back up to the 3F. Do the same thing
to  the next 2 blue sections of the tower, then roll across the snow to
reach  the  actual  platform.  Look  across  it,  and you will see some
snowballs,  so  punch  them away, and climb the stairs. At the top, you
will  see  the  boss door. Roll up, and fly across the gap, and over to
the boss door. Now crush the icicles in front of it, and enter the room
to fight this Temple's boss.

Run into the room, and you'll find Goht trapped in ice. Free him wish a
Fire Arrow. Now he'll begin a long rampage around this area, doing laps
and  going  mad. Roll up, and begin a super-charge with Goron Link, and
chase  him  around,  all  while  avoiding  his bombs that he drops, the
falling  rocks,  the  rocks he kicks at you with his hind legs, and his
electrical  charges.  One  thing  to remember is to not get in front of
him, or the electical charges will seriously harm you. Chase him around
with  your  spiked-roll,  and when you get near him, just ram into Goht
until  he  drops,  then continue your attack until he gets back up, and
starts  to  run  again. Repeat this three times, and Goht will run into
the  side of the wall, and will be crushed by huge boulders. Run around
to where he died to get your Full Heart Container.


Step  inside  of the portal, and take Goht's Remains! Watch the cinema,
and  return  to  the  game,  surrounded by frogs! Now that the snow has
melted  away,  certain  places will open up, like the new path in Goron
Village  that  leads  to a Biggoron who sells Powder Kegs to Gorons, so
enter  there  as Goron Link, and take the Powder Keg from him. Now take
it  to  the entrance of Mountain Village, and up the hills and place it
in  front of the large boulder blocking the Goron Races, near the small
Goron.  It  will  blow up, allowing you to enter the Goron Races. Enter
the  race,  and  win  the  race to get some Gold Dust, which comes in a
Bottle!  Now as normal Link, take this Gold Dust, then head back to the
Biggoron  where  you  got your Powder Keg from to get another one. Take
this,  and head to Romani Ranch on Milk Road, and use it to blow up the
giant boulder blocking the entrance to Romani Ranch on the First Day.


Enter the Ranch, and speak to Romani, the girl outside. She'll tell you
about  "them",  who  come  every year before the carnival, and tell you
that they steal her cows. Now, she'll ask if you would like to try your
hand  at  being  her  assistant, so agree, then play her training game.
Shoot all 10 of the balloons around the ranch while on Epona in under 1
minute, and she'll teach you a new song, Epona's Song! Now play it, and
you will get Epona back!


While  you're  here,  wait until 2AM to wait for the UFOs that come for
her  cows.  Fend them off with your arrows all night long, until around
5:30AM  to  6AM,  when  the sun comes up, and if you defended the Ranch
well  enough,  Romani will give you a bottle filled with Chateau Romani
milk!  Woohoo! Another bottle! Good stuff man. Stay here some more, and
talk  to  Romani and her sister outside of the barn. Now you'll have to
guide  Romani  and her milk shipment back to Clock Town, so hop on with
her,  and  get going! Along the way, there will be thieves who will try
to  steal  the  milk, so fend them off with your Hero's Bow and Arrows,
and eventually, you will get to Clock Town safely, and you will receive
the Romani Mask! Okay, time to get one more mask before we move  on  in
the game: The Circus Leader's Mask (you can only get this mask after you
have the Romani Mask). After getting the Romani Mask, head to the Milk
Bar in Clock Town around 10PM on either Day 1 or Day 2, and talk to the
fish near the stage. Agree to help him with his performance, and he'll
have you play your instrument on a certain spot on the stage. Talk to
him as each form of Link (normal, Goron, Deku, Zora), and you'll end up
playing the Ballad of the Windfish, which will make Gorman cry, and give
you the Circus Leader's Mask!

If  you still have time, return to Mountain Village, and bring the Gold
Dust  with  you. Now enter the log cabin here, and be sure you have 100
Rupees  too. Now have them reforge your sword, but this time, since you
have  the  Gold Dust, they can make your sword stronger forever. If you
need  quick-cash,  just  go  to East Clock Town, and enter the Bomber's
Hideout,  and  run down the ramp. Now instead of heading into the water
and  straight  to  head  to  the Observatory, swim to the left down the
corridor  to a seemingly dead-end. Avoid the Skulltula, and to the left
at  the  end  is a ledge. Climb up it, and you will see a bombable wall
with a crack in it. Take out a bomb, and bomb the wall open to reveal a
chest.  Inside  this  chest  is  the  legendary  Silver  Rupee, worth a
whopping  100  Rupees! Now use this 100 Rupees to reforge your sword to
get  the  Razor  Sword!  Now speak to them again, and he'll ask for the
Gold Dust, and when it says press a C-button to pull out an item, press
the  C-Button  that has your Gold Dust on it, and he'll do it for free.
Come back the next morning to get the Gilded Sword!


Head  out  to  Termina Field with Epona when you are finished here, and
ride  to North Termina Field, and into the Great Bay Area. Hop over the
fence with Epona, and ride into Great Bay Coast.

Enter  the beach area, and stop there for the moment. Now swim out into
the ocean to the left to find a Zora in the need of help. He's floating
above  some birds, so he's not hard to spot. Now swim up behind him and
push  him  to the shore. Now talk to him, and listen to his final words
(it's  a  really  crappy  song, ain't it?). After he says "someone heal
me",  play the Song of Healing to him, and watch the cut-scene. When it
ends,  he'll  leave  the Zora Mask, and Link will take it. Put the mask
on,  and  swim out to the first platform you see. Climb up onto it, and
hit the Owl Statue here to activate it for later.


Now return back to the beach, and run to the right of the beach to find
a  cave  opening,  so head through it to the other side. Now turn right
and look into the ocean. There is a large fin on top of a structure out
there,  so swim to it, and once you are there, sink to the ocean floor,
kill the Like-Like, then enter Zora Hall (the big mouth).

that  sells  arrows, a Hero's Shield, and some Red Potion. Head left of
this  shop  to end up back outside. Hit the Owl Statue here to activate
it,  then  turn  to  the  right,  and  speak with Princess Ruto (who is
wearing  blue). Warp back to Clock Town, and buy some Red Potion for 30
Rupees  at  the  Trading  Post,  then exit out the Eastern Exit in East
Clock Town. Now run straight while riding Epona, and hop over the first
two  fences,  and  you  will  reach  an area with group of rocks to the
right.  Use  your Lens of Truth to spot a soldier sitting in the center
of  them,  waving  his  hands  around.  Speak  to  him to find out that
everyone ignores him, and he'll ask for something to help him. Give him
the  Red  Potion, and he'll give you the Stone Mask as a reward! You'll
need this mask for later...


Now  play  the Song of Soaring, and return to the first Owl Statue that
you activated in Great Bay Coast. Now hop into the water, and swim over
to  the  right  of where the Owl Statue is, and continue swimming until
you  reach  another  Zora near the wall. Talk to her to learn about the
Pirates,  then sink down to the ocean floor, and walk along the wall to
towards  the beach. Along the way, you will see some wooden boards with
skulls on them, which Tatl points out to you. Swim or roll into them to
break  them  (some  are  fakes),  until you reach the "real" one, which
reveals  a  hidden  path.  Now enter this hidden underwater tunnel, and
once  you  reach  some  guards, put on the Stone Mask so they don't see
you.

Once  you are in here, run up the small ramp, and look around your area
and be sure that there are no ships or boats around you, then dive into
the water as Zora Link, and swim to the left, and you should eventually
find  a  ramp  that is underwater that leads up to a Goron Switch above
water.  Put on your Goron Mask, and do a Goron Slam onto it to activate
it,  put  on  your  Zora Mask, then swim to the newly open gate that is
underwater  to  the south. If a boat or guard gets near you, just throw
on your Stone Mask to conceal yourself from them.


In  the  next  area, swim to the gate with the wooden board covering it
and  swim  into  it  to  break it, then swim through it to find a large
block.  Hang  a left of this block, break the next two boards, and swim
straight  to  find  another  block.  Push it as far as it will go, then
enter  the new path to the right to find the first block. Push this one
as  far  as  it  will  go,  then  return to the first block towards the
beginning  of  this  area,  and it will be out of your way. Run forward
from here, and step into the vaccuum of water ahead.


At  the  top, swim forward, avoiding the spikes while you're at it, and
swim  forward, and underneath the next vaccuum of water, because if you
get  sucked  into  it, you will be spit back out to the main water area
(where the boats are), and you will have to do this again. Now past the
vaccuum  is a ledge with a door. Climb up, and enter the door. Swim out
past the ramp to find a chest underwater with a Red Rupee, then head up
the  ramp,  then  the  stairs, and head left to a bunch of barrels. Now
smash  the  barrels  with  Goron Link to open a door below containing a
Heart  Piece,  then  either  roll down to the door before it closes, or
switch  to  normal  Link  with the Bunny Hood to get it. Take the Heart
Piece,  then  head  back  up the stairs and turn right to see a crystal
switch.  Use  Zora  Link's  boomerang (hold A, then release) to hit the
switch, then quickly swim through the new gate.


Swim forward past the water vaccuum by swiming along the surface of the
water,  then  climb the ladder at the end of the path. Now quickly step
on  the  floor  switch, run onto the grate, then hit the crystal switch
that  is  revealed to activate the gyser you are standing on. Climb the
ladder  here  and  use  the telescope to check out the guards. Now turn
around, and destroy the spikes with your boomerang. After they blow up,
hit  the  switch behind the spikes, and climb down the ladder, and exit
out the door.


Head  around the outer ledge, up the ramp, and enter the inner fortress
area.  Now  with  the  Stone  Mask  on, run to the center area with the
ladder,  climb it, and head across the bridge, but shoot the guard here
with  an  arrow  before  exiting  through the door. Watch the cut-scene
explaining  why  you  must  find  all  7  of  the  Zora Eggs. After the
cut-scene,  shoot  the bee-hive with an arrow, and the room will clear.
Now exit the way you came in here from, go back across the bridge, down
the  ladder,  then  head up the ramp that is to the left of the bridge,
and  enter the door that leads to the room you just cleared. Or you can
just  hop  down  to the ledge with the door from where you just exited.
Inside, there is a large chest containing the Hookshot!


Look  up  above  the  fish  tank  with the clam in it, and hookshot the
wooden beam above it. Now you'll land above the tank, so turn into Zora
Link, kill the clam, and take the first Zora Egg from the tank. Capture
it  in  a  bottle, then exit the tank. Leave the room, and look to your
left. You should see a hookshot target-tower, so run onto that platform
with  it,  then look up to spot another one on the next ledge. Hookshot
your way up there, then enter the door to the left. Run past the guard,
and  enter  the  next door. In here, the door will lock behind you, and
you  will be forced to fight a guard. Defeat the guard to open the next
door  leading to an egg. This egg is also inside of a tank, so take it.
By  now  you  should have run out of empty bottles, so warp back to the
first  owl  statue near the Marine Research Facility, and drop off your
Eggs  here  as  Zora Link, then return to the Fortress, go to the first
Goron  Switch,  and  then  hookshot your way back into the main area to
continue your search for the eggs.


Once  back at the entrance to the main fortress area, go left to find a
hookshot  target  on  a  ledge,  so  make  your  way up to it with your
hookshot, then hookshot your way to the next target to the left of that
target, and enter the door. Defeat the guard just like you did earlier,
then  enter the next room with the tank, and take the Egg. Now exit out
the next door.


Hop  down to the main area again, and turn left, and make your way back
to  the hookshot target near the door you just entered to get the third
egg,  and  look  up  to  the  opposite  side of the door to see another
hookshot  target  high  above. Get up there, and run past the guard and
across the bridge, and into the next door.


Dispose of the guards momentarily in here, then open the chest to get a
Silver Rupee worth 100 Rupees. Now head up the ramp, and enter the door
to  fight  yet  another guard. Now warp back to the Owl Statue near the
Marine  Research  Center,  and  drop off the last two eggs. Now quickly
return  to  the fortress and take a picture of a pirate, then return to
the  shoreline  with the 2 houses, and enter the one on the right. Talk
to  the  man  here, and show him your picture of the pirate. He'll give
you  the  seahorse that wants to be returned to Pinnacle Rock, and will
lead  you  there. Exit the hut, and swim out to the right of the Marine
Center, and locate the two pillars in the water. Stand in between them,
and  release  the seahorse here. Be sure you are just past the entrance
to Pinnacle Rock before doing this.

Follow  the  gold  seahorse  by  walking on the ocean floor, and at the
entrance  to  Pinnacle  Rock,  he'll ask you to help his other seahorse
friend.  Now  just  sink  to the bottom, and search inside of the holes
here  to  find large snakes. Draw them out, and then hit them with your
boomerang  twice  to kill them. Some areas will reveal an egg, and some
will  reveal  other  stuff.  Inside  one  of  these  holes is the other
seahorse.  After  nabbing  two  eggs, return back to the Marine Center,
drop them off, then go back to Pinnacle Rock and find the last egg, and
the  lost  seahorse  to  get  a  Heart  Piece when you re-unite the two
seahorses.


Return  the last egg to the aquarium in the Marine Research Center, and
watch  the sequence inside of the aquarium as the eggs hatch, and teach
you the New Wave Bossa Nova song as Zora Link! Now exit the Center, and
warp  to  the Owl Statue in Zora Hall, and play the New Wave Bossa Nova
song  to  Princess  Ruto, and she'll summon Lulu, the giant sea turtle.
Hookshot  onto  her  back with one of the trees, and she'll take you to
the Great Bay Temple.

First  off,  light all of the torches here to find Stray Fairy #1. Head
through the door, and enter the main control room with all of the stuff
that controls the flow of water in this temple. Now turn left, and ride
the elevator to find a platform with some Rupees and a Skulltula on it.
Kill  the Skulltula to get Stray Fairy #2. Hop into the water, and sink
to  the  bottom  to find Stray Fairy #3 under the water. Now look for a
circular  platform with a pushable switch on it (still underwater), and
push  it. You'll hear a confirmation sound, so now ride up the elevator
to  the  left  of  the  main door, and hop onto the platform with the 2
Skulltulas,  kill  'em,  then  hop across the fountain, and through the
next door.


Now  look to the northern part of the room to find a hole that leads to
a  new  room, so enter it, and inside the next room, hop onto the ledge
with  the  pots,  then  hookshot  over  to  the large chest to find the
Dungeon  Map.  Now locate the underwater tunnel to the right and across
from  the  chest, and swim inside it, and past the hands trying to grab
you. Follow the red pipe in here, and enter the next area with the Deku
Babas,  so  sink  to the floor, and kill them with your boomerang. Head
through the next door.


Dive  into  the water, and kill every enemy here, then locate the small
chest  with  a  Small Key in it. Take it, then surface. Now hop onto to
the  platform,  and  hookshot  your  way  to the large chest to get the
Compass.  Now  return  to  the platform, and enter the vaccuum of water
near  the  red  pipe  and return to the large room. Sink down, and walk
until  you  find a tunnel with a red pipe in it, and follow it into the
next room. Float up to the surface here, and climb up the red pipe, and
through  the  next  locked  door using your Small Key. Break all of the
pots  in  this  next  room,  then  enter  the next door to fight a hard
mini-boss fight.

This guy is tough, trust me. First off, he's surrounded by some bubbles
which  block  his  eyeball, so fire at them with some arrows until they
fall  off,  and  destroy  them. Now keep doing this over and over again
until  you can see his eye, and aim for it. Now shoot a Fire Arrow into
his  eye,  and after some damage, he'll start to charge across the room
over  and over again, so block his attacks, and when his eye is exposed
to  you, fire another Fire Arrow at his eye. After enough damage, he'll
go  down,  revealing  a  large  chest.  Open the chest to find some Ice
Arrows!


Exit  the  room,  and  go  back  to the room with the red pipe, and the
Octorok.  Freeze  the  Octorok  with  an  Ice  Arrow, then use him as a
platform to reach the center switch. Now push it, and hop back into the
water,  and enter the blue vent to return to the large main room again.
Hop  onto  the  spinning  platform  in the center of the room, and then
climb  up  to  the  ledge  that leads to a ladder blocked off by water.
Shoot  the water with an Ice Arrow, then climb up the ladder, and enter
the  next  room.  Use  your  Ice Arrows to create Icburgs to get to the
Yellow  platform, then head over to the green one next. Push the switch
here,  then return to the yellow platform, and look up to see a hole in
the  ceiling.  Make  an iceburg near here so you can see into the hole,
and hookshot your way into the hole by hitting the target in here. Take
Stray Fairy #4, then return to the main room. From here, go back to the
room  where you got the Dungeon Map. Make Iceburgs, and head across the
room and enter the next door.


In  here,  freeze  the Blue Chuchu into ice, then push the ice block to
the  ledge,  climb up, and push the switch. Now exit, and return to the
room  where  you got the Compass. In here, you'll see a ledge with some
ice in it, so create some iceburgs to get here, slash the ice with your
sword, then melt the ice with a Fire Arrow, and enter the next door.

This  fight is easier than the previous boss battle, but you have to be
quick to make it easy. Be sure to have some Ice Arrows ready, and begin
the  fight.  Dodge the bubbles he throws at you, then hit him with your
sword.  Now  he'll  summon  all  of the bubbles, and he'll form a large
bubble  at  the  top of the room, towards the ceiling. Shoot the bubble
quickly  with  an Ice Arrow, and it'll collapse and shatter. Now repeat
this  process  over  and over until he dies. The door unlocks, so enter
it, and take the Boss Key.


Exit  this small room through the hole in the gold fence, then hop back
into  the  water,  and  enter the flow of water and return to the large
main  room.  Once back in the first large main room, look to your right
to  see a fountain and a hookshot target above it. Shoot the target and
land on the fountain. Now when the fountain gets to it's highest point,
hop onto the red platform with the switch, and push it. Now hop down to
the yellow platform with a switch, push it, then go back into the third
room, the other main room.


Under  the water is a path that leads to the next area, and it's to the
upper-right  of  where  you  enter this room, so swim into it at a very
fast  speed  to  avoid  the hands blocking your way, and enter the next
room. Climb up onto the elevator here, and wait for the moving platform
across  from  you to get near, and hop onto the spinning cylindar, then
onto  this  platform.  Take it to the ledge on the other side, and then
turn  around  and  aim  for the fountain of water. Shoot it with an Ice
Arrow to stop the cylindar from spinning, and run across the blades and
enter the next door.


This  room can be very confusing. Start off by standing on the farthest
see-saw  from  you,  then  shoot the ice above you with a Fire Arrow to
rise,  then  hop  onto the see-saw to the right, and shoot another Fire
Arrow  at the ice above you to rise to the green switch here. Now go to
the  see-saw that is closest to the entrance of this room, and hop onto
the  pipe  here,  enter the next room, then swim back to the main room.
Look  towards  the  bottom of this area for a tunnel that is green, and
enter  it,  and make your way across the green pipe. Push the switch to
create a fountain that leads to this temple's boss.

Start this boss fight off by remaining on the surface of the water, and
on  a  platform. Now wait for Gyorg to swim near you, and when he jumps
out  of the water, shoot either a boomerang or an arrow at him. After a
while,  he'll stop attacking momentarily, and get knocked out. Now dive
into  the  water,  and  charge  up your Zora Shield near him to do some
damage,  and  when  he gets back up, return to the platform, and repeat
this  over  and over until he dies off, but first, he'll start to shoot
fish at you, so just avoid this, and continue your method of attack.


After  the  fight,  take  the  Full  Heart Container, and step into the
portal to get Gyorg's Remains!

 006. The Fourth Guardian Mask

===============================================================================

For  now,  you'll  probably  want another Empty Bottle for yourself, so
head  onto  the shore with the Skulltula House and the Fisherman's Hut,
and  head to the right of these two houses, and through the hole in the
cave,  and  to  the other side, onto the next beach. Continue along the
beach,  past  the Zoras, and until you reach a large piece of wood that
you  can climb onto in the sand. Head onto it, and hookshot your way to
the  platform  above you, the one with the palm tree on it, and use the
palm  tree  as  a target for your hookshot. Now continue to do this for
all  of the palm tree platforms in this area, until you reach a hole in
the  wall  near  a  waterfall. Enter it to be in Waterfall Rapids. Once
here,  dive  into the water as Zora Link, and talk to the beaver at the
floor  of  the  water.  He'll  ask  you if you want to race for a Empty
Bottle,  so agree. Now you only have 2 minutes to swim through 20 rings
underwater  (swim  through  the  ones that are spinning, and stay close
behind  the  beaver),  and if you do this in under 2 minutes, the other
beaver  will  then challenge you. Now you have to swim through 25 rings
in  under  2  minutes.  This is a bit more challenging, but nothing you
can't  do.  After doing this, the beavers will give up, and give you an
Empty Bottle.


There's  nothing  much  to  do  here  right now, so exit this area, and
return  to  Termina  Field. A good idea would be to return to the First
Day,  and  then  come  back to Great Bay Coast, and enter the Skulltula
House,  and collect every Skulltula Token from the house, and to do so,
check   out   the  "Oceanside  Skulltula  House"  mini-section  in  the
"Side-Quests/Mini-Games"  section  of  this FAQ to find out where every
Skulltula  Token  is. If you do this on the First Day, you will get the
Giant's Wallet, which allows you to hold up to 500 Rupees! Now that you
have the capacity, let's go get a mask, shall we?


Get  ahold  of  500  Rupees  (use  the  Unlimited  Rupee  trick  in the
"Side-Quests/Mini-Games"  section of this FAQ to get some easy Rupees),
and  then  head  back  to North Clock Town on Day 1, and stop the thief
from stealing the old woman's bag, then head to the Curiosity Shop, and
purchase the All-Night Mask from the owner for 500 Rupees! Want another
mask?  You  got  it.  Okay, head out to Termina Field, and head to Milk
Road  with  Epona, and hang a left before entering Romani Ranch, and be
sure  to  bring  along some Rupees (at least 20-40). Enter Gorman Track
with  Epona,  and  talk  to the Gormans here to race them for something
special.  Race for 10 Rupees, and begin the race. During the race, it's
a  good  idea to save your Carrots for the last leg of the race to pull
ahead  of  the  Gormans, but be sure to use at least 1-2 Carrots during
the  entire race to keep up with them. Use a Carrot or two, wait for it
to  recharge,  then  keep  doing  what you've been doing. This strategy
should  win  you  the race easily. After the race, you will receive the
Garo's Mask from the losers!


When  you are ready, head off to Ikana Graveyard in Termina Field. Once
inside the graveyard (you'll have to ride Epona over the fences leading
to  it),  run  north and approach the large skeleton-guy lyin down, and
play  the Sonata of Awakening to wake him up. He'll stand up, and begin
to run away. Right away, begin to chase him.


Start  your  pursuit,  and  when  the  walls  of fire rise up, kill the
enemies  that  come  out to lower the fire walls, and when you have the
skeleton  in your sites, shoot arrows at him to slow his ass down. Once
you finally catch up to Keeta, you'll begin a small fight. Slash at him
with  your  sword  really  quick,  then  fire some Ice Arrows at him to
freeze  him  temporarily.  Use  this  time  to  get  some  shot in, and
eventually,  he'll  jump  into  the  air. Watch out for his shadow, and
dodge  his dropping attack, then continue fighting him the way you were
earlier, and after enough damage, he'll give up.


When  the  fight  ends,  Keeta will admit defeat, and will allow you to
access  the chest across from where he is, surrounded by fire. When the
flames  lower, hookshot your way to it, and take the Captain's Hat from
the chest.


Now  play the Song of Double Time to warp ahead so that it's nighttime,
and  head  into the Graveyard again. Now speak to the Stalchildren near
the  first grave while wearing the Captain's Mask, and they'll open the
grave for you.


NOTE: You should come back here (Graveyard) with on the Final Day after
6PM,  and  enter  with  the Captain's Hat. Now tell the Stalchildren to
open  the  grave  they are dancing around, and enter the grave. Inside,
you  will  find Dampe, and he's looking for the buried treasure. To get
this  treasure,  you'll have to lead his SLOW ass to each of the 6 dirt
patches  down  here.  There are 5 on the ground, and the last one is on
top  of  a pillar near a ladder. To lead Dampe up here, simply lead him
onto  the  brown  platform  that moves, then climb up the ladder on the
other side of the area to meet him up on the dirt patch. After he's dug
up  all 6 dirt patches (3 of them will reveal parts of a poe...), a Big
Poe  will  come  out,  and  you'll have to fight it. To beat it, simply
block his spin attack, then when it stops, shoot it with an arrow, then
do  a  180 to spot the Poe again, and repeat until it dies. Now a chest
will be revealed, and inside is an Empty Bottle!

Once inside of the grave, take off the Captain's Mask, and hop over the
platforms,  and  through the next doorway, and kill all of the Keese in
here to reveal a chest containing 50 Rupees, so take them. Now use Fire
Arrows to light all of the torches in here to open the next door. Enter

                              Boss: Iron Knuckle

To  defeat  this  monstrosity, simply strike before he strikes you. Hit
him  once  to  start the fight, then hit him a few more times before he
swings  his  axe  at  you, dodge those attacks, then hit him some more.
Wait for him to get his axe stuck in the ground, then hit him a lot for
some  serious  damage,  until  his  first layer of armor comes off. Now
continue this strategy to kill him for good.


After the fight, you'll meet a Composer Poe, who will show you were you
can  learn  the  Song  of  Storms,  so  when  he dissappears, check the
tombstone  to  learn  the  Song of Storms! When you are done, leave the
Graveyard,  and  head  to the right of the entrance of the Graveyard to
find  an  old man sitting on the ledge. Put on the Garo Mask, and he'll
laugh  at  you, then place a tree there so you can hookshot your way up
the ledge. Do this, and at the top, run forward, and into Ikana Canyon.

Run forward to the broken bridge, and use some Ice Arrows to freeze the
Octoroks  here,  use  them  as  platforms to get to the other side, and
hookshot  onto  the  tree  to your left. Now hookshot onto the next two
trees  to reach the top of this area, and to find an Owl Statue. Hit it
to  activate  it, then run forward, and up the next few ramps to find a
dried up lake, and a tunnel that leads out to it. Enter the tunnel, and
you  will  meet  a  Poe  who will start to attack you. Play the Song of
Storms,  and  the  water  flow will start up, refilling the lake again.
Watch  the  cinemas,  then  watch  as  the  center house's door becomes
unlocked.  Run out to that house, and watch the little girl run away at
the sight of you.


To  get  inside  of  her house, place a bomb in front of her door, then
hide.  When she comes out, wait until she gets far enough away from you
and  the  door,  then  dash  to  the  door,  and  enter  the house. Run
downstairs,  and  watch  the mummified man come out of the closet, then
IMMEDIATELY take out your Ocarina, and play the Song of Healing to save
him  before  his  daughter  kicks you out of the house. Doing this will
save  the  father,  and  allow  Link  to get the Gibdo Mask! Now before
moving on, be sure you have these items:

- 1 Empty Bottle
- 5 Magic Beans
- 10 Deku Nuts
- 10 Bombs
- 1 Bottle of Milk (Buy this milk from the Gormans at Gorman Track, or
                    inside the hidden hole near the Swamp entrance, the
		    hole with the cows in it, and play Epona's Song to
		    get some free milk)
- 1 Bottle of Bugs
- 1 Bottle with a Fish (You can find some fish inside of the hole in
                        the ground that is outside of Southern Swamp,
                        near a tree)
- At least 170 Rupees


You  should  have at least these items before dropping into the Beneath
the  Well  area in Ikano Canyon. Once you have all of these items, then
head  up  to the left of the Music House in Ikana Canyon, and drop into
the well.

Now  if  you want, you can ignore the entire north and west side of the
well,  because  there's nothing there that you need. There is a Fairy's
Fountain  to the north, as well as some extra Rupees, but that's it. So
instead,  take  a  right at the entrance, and speak to the ReDead. Give
him  your  5  Magic  Beans, then head through the now unlocked door. BE
SURE  TO  HAVE THE GIBDO MASK ON AT ALL TIMES! Now run straight, and to
the  door  at the end of the path, to the eastward part of the map, and
speak  to the ReDead here and give him the 10 Deku Nuts to pass through
the door. Head straight, kill the fire keese, then take a left and talk
to the ReDead to the north, near the large room. Give him 10 Bombs, and
enter  the  next  room to fight a Poe. Circle the Poe and wait until he
stops  rotating,  then shoot him with arrows. When he's dead, catch the
Poe in your Empty Bottle, then exit the room, and head back through the
door you just came in (leave the room with the Fire Keese).


In  the  room  that  was  BEFORE the Fire Keese hall, turn right to see
another  door  with a ReDead, and speak to him, and give him your Fish.
Run through the door, and run straight through the next hallway, and to
the  door  at  the  end,  and give the ReDead near the locked door your
Large  Poe that you just caught in a bottle, and enter the hallway with
large spikes going back and forth. Wait for the Wallmaster to drop down
near you (look for it's shadow, then move), and kill it, then avoid the
spikes, and kill the next Wallmaster that drops down, and give the next
ReDead your Milk, and enter the next room.


In  here,  you  will  find 4 unlit torches, and a sun dial on the wall.
Shoot  all 4 torches with Fire Arrows to reveal a new chest. Open it to
find  the Mirror Shield! Now with your new Mirror Shield, reflect light
onto  the  small  sun face on the wall to reveal a hidden ladder. Shine
some  more  light  onto  the large block above the ladder to remove it,
then  enter  the  next  area: The Castle of Ikana. But before entering,
play  the  Song  of  Soaring and fly back to Clock Town, and purchase a
Powder  Keg  from  the  Bomb  Shop. Warp back to Ikana Canyon, and turn
right  of  the  Owl  Statue  to  find a small hole in the wall near the
gates, and enter it.

                          • Ancient Castle of Ikana •

§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

You'll  end  up  standing near a large sun block, and there's a crystal
switch  to your left, so hit it with your sword, and sunlight will come
shining  down  on  you.  Reflect  light  onto the large block with your
Mirror  Shield  to make it dissappear. Enter the castle itself with the
Gibdo  Mask  on  and watch the ReDeads dance for you! Hit the iced-over
eye  switch with a Fire Arrow to open the next door to the left (west).
Enter it.


Inside here, transform into Deku Link, and hit the switch. Run over the
floor  when it rises, and to the other side of the room near the second
switch  is. When the floor comes back down again, hit this switch, then
use  the  nearest Deku Flower to launch up to the platform with a floor
switch on it. As normal Link, step on the switch to open the next door,
then shoot the crystal switch with an arrow to rise the floor, and exit
out the door. In here, kill the Skulltulas hanging around the room with
some  arrows,  then use your Hookshot to hit the hanging spikes so that
they hit each other, and blow up. Now as Deku Link, use the Deku Flower
to fly over to the floor switch to the left of the door, and step on it
as  normal  Link,  and  use  your  Lens  of  Truth to see the invisible
platform.  Use  this  to  reach  the next ledge, then hop from ledge to
ledge and to the exit.


Kill the Blue Bubbles in this room then head up the stairs to reach the
top of the Castle (outside). Run forward, and climb onto the ledge, and
follow  it  to  the left, and to the platform with a Deku Flower on it.
Use  this to fly over to the platform to your left with a switch on it,
and step on it as normal Link. Now fly down to the ground, and re-enter
the  castle  through the main entrance. Inside here, look to your right
for  another frozen eye switch, so melt it with a Fire Arrow, and enter
the room to your right.


This room (the east room), contains a Floormaster, which when attacked,
will  shatter  into  3 smaller ones. To beat him easily, just run at it
with  your  mirror  shield,  and  the light will kill it off. Now shine
light onto the sun block, and enter the room to fight a boss fight.

And  Wizrobe  returns.  He'll  randomly appear at one of the four outer
areas,  and when he starts to rotate around, attack him with your sword
or  arrows.  After enough damage, he'll make copies of himself, so just
look  around  until you see the rotating one again, and attack. When he
shoots  Fire balls at you, just avoid them and use your map to find his
location  (he's  the red dot). When he dies, the next door will unlock.
Enter it.


Run  past  the  ReDeads,  and  head  up the stairs to exit back outside
again.  Run  around  past  the hole, and run to the right and Tatl will
point out a large crack in the ground. Put on the Goron Mask, and place
your  Powder  Keg  here.  Blow  up  the hole, drop down, and shine your
newfound  light source onto the large sun block. Smash the pots here to
stock up on magic power and arrows, then enter the next door to fight a
boss.

                              Boss: IGOS DU IKANA

This boss is a really hard one, mainly because you have to first defeat
his  two  skeleton  henchmen, then defeat the main boss himself, who is
already  very  hard  to beat. To defeat the first two henchmen, quickly
shoot  some  Fire  Arrows at the two curtains covering the sunlight, to
reveal  sun  into  the room. Now attack these two enemies just like the
way  you  fight  Stalfos  and Wolfos, in that you should hit them right
before and after they try to attack you, and also hit their backs. When
they  fall  into a pile of nothing, shine light onto them to kill them.
Now when they are gone, you will have to fight the real boss.


This  guy  is  really  hard,  since  he's  just like the henchmen, only
bigger,  stronger, smarter, and has more attacks. But the one thing you
must  remember is that you have to kill him the same way as you did the
two henchmen. You must attack his back to do any damage, so to do this,
stand  in  the  light,  and  when he turns his back to you to run away,
shoot  an  arrow at him, then attack with your sword. When he makes his
head  spin  around  the  room, simply avoid both his head and his body,
until  you  get  hit,  then  his  body will go back together again. Now
repeat  your  strategy,  and  he'll soon shoot out poisonous breath, so
avoid this at all costs. It's also a good idea to have at least 1 Fairy
in  a  bottle  for  this  fight, because you might take too much damage
before  he  is  defeated. Once you finally get him on the ground, shine
light on him to finally defeat this monster.


After  the  fight,  you'll  watch a semi-funny cinema involving the two
henchmen,  and  then  Igos Du Ikana, the king of Ikana. He'll teach you
the  Elegy  of  Emptiness,  which  allows Link to create a exact statue
replica of Link's form (one statue can be made for each form, therefore
creating at least 4 different statues at once).


Now  exit back into Ikana Canyon, and go to the right of the used to be
dried  up  lake and the Music House, and run up the ramp to enter Stone
Tower.

Run forward past the first three stone platforms, and to a switch. Step
on  it,  and  play the Elegy of Emptiness, and make the statue stand on
the switch. Now Hookshot up to the next level with the hookshot target,
switch  to  Goron  Link, play the Elegy of Emptiness and clone onto the
switch,  then  hookshot  up  to  the  next level. Near the next switch,
change  to  Zora  Link,  play the Elegy of Emptiness to clone onto this
switch, then hookshot up to the next level as normal Link.


Now  run across the next 3 stone blocks as normal Link, and step on the
next  three  switches on the other side, because they reset the blocks.
Now  hookshot  your  way to the next level, and clone yourself onto the
switch  here  by  playing  the  Elegy of Emptiness as normal Link, then
hookshot  your  way to the next switch. Up here, bomb the Beamos before
his  laser  catches  you, and play the Elegy of Emptiness to clone onto
the  switch as Goron Link, turn back to normal Link, and hookshot up to
the  next level, then play the Elegy of Emptiness to clone as Zora Link
on  this switch, and hop across the 3 stone blocks as normal Link, step
on the 3 reset switches, and hookshot up to the next platform.


Now  continue  to  hookshot to the next 2 ledges, and up to the highest
point  of  Stone  Tower,  where you can find 3 switches, some pots, and
finally  an  Owl Statue. Hit the Owl Statue to activate it, and hit one
of  the  pots to find a Fairy inside, so catch it with your bottle. Now
if  you  are NOT on Day 1, I strongly suggest that you play the Song of
Time,  save  your game (after activating the Owl Statue), and once back
to  Day  1,  playing  the Inverted Song of Time to slow time down, then
warping  back  to this Owl Statue to continue on into the Stone Temple.
Or,  if  you  have  tons  of  Rupees, warping back to Clock Town first,
depositing  your  Rupees  at the bank, then playing the Song of Time to
return  to  Day  1. Once you are back at the Owl Statue in Stone Tower,
locate  the  3  switches  near  the Owl Statue. Now facing them and the
temple's  entrance  across from the Owl Statue, step on the switches in
this  order,  and  make a different clone for each: Right, Left, Center
switch. Do this, and the blocks will line up, allowing you to enter the
Stone Tower Temple.

Even  though  this  temple  doesn't  seem  hard, it can become somewhat
confusing  at  times, so be weary of the hazards and puzzles. Start off
by  killing  the Dragonflies, then shoot the Eye Switch ahead of you to
bring down a chest. Now enter the door to your left, and enter the room
with a bunch of switches.


Start  off by killing the Bomb-Dogs, then create a clone of yourself on
every  switch  here,  except the large one and a single small one. Bomb
the  bombable  wall  in  here to reveal some crates, so destroy them as
Goron  Link  to  reveal  a small crate. Pick it up, and place it on the
single small switch, then create a Goron Link clone on the single large
switch,  and the gate will open. Enter the courtyard area, and look for
the  square  on the ground that does not have any leaves growing out of
it,  and  bomb  it  to  allow  light  to enter the room below. Kill the
Dragonfly really fast, then head down the stairs near the hole you just
created.  Down  here,  reflect  light  onto the sun stone here, then as
Goron  Link,  run  across  the  lava, and head to the chest to find the
Dungeon Map.


Now  bomb  the  2  statues near this chest, then the two statues in the
lava,  and another chest will show up, containing a small key. Take it,
then exit the room, go back upstairs to the courtyard, and use this key
on the locked door here. Hop into the water here as Zora Link, and find
the  passage  with  the Grab-Hands, and let them grab you, because they
will toss you out of the water and onto a ledge with a chest that has a
small  key. Take the key, hop back into the water, kill the Grab-Hands,
and  swim  through  the  passage.  Down here, kill the spikes with your
boomerang,  then  step on the switch. Now surface, and climb out of the
water,  and find the frozen eye switch above a doorway. Shoot it with a
Fire Arrow to reveal another chest for later on. Now turn down the hall
with the mirror, and shine light onto it, so it absorbs the light for a
good  length  of  time.  Now run over to it, and use the light it gives
off, and shine it into the sun stone to get rid of it. Now run past the
sun  stone,  kill  the Bomb-Dog to your left, and take the Compass from
the  chest.  Go  back to the locked door near the used-to-be frozen eye
switch, and enter the door.


In  here, fend off the shadow creatures, then as Goron Link, smash away
the  center  pillars  to reveal another pillar with some mirrors on it.
Reflect  light  onto the first mirror to your left on the center pillar
and  onto the mirror beyond it, then use THAT light to reflect onto the
sun  stone  in  the back of the room. Now go back to the first patch of
light,  and reflect light onto the first mirror on the center pillar to
your  right,  and onto the sun stone. This reveals a chest with a Fairy
inside. Now exit out the next door.


As  Deku  Link,  you want to use the Deku Launchers in here to fly over
the  vents below, and use the air that is flowing upward to keep you in
the  air,  and  make it to the other side of the room with a door and a
flaming  chest.  Ignore  the  chest, and enter the door to fight a boss
battle for some Light Arrows.

This  guy is pretty easy to beat if you are quick. First, use the Bunny
Hood to increase your speed, then wait for him to attack with his sword
slash.  Now  dodge it, and when he stands here momentarily, attack once
with your sword, then immediately block, because he will counter-attack
right  away.  Repeat  this over and over until he's toast, and take the
Light Arrows from the chest that is revealed after the fight.


Enter  the  next  door that has unlocked in the boss room, and you will
see  a  Hiploop  enemy  on the bridge. Use your Hookshot to remove it's
mask,  then  attack  it  (arrows or your sword, whatever you want). Now
enter  the  next  door,  and fight the Eyegore. This cycloptic enemy is
pretty  easy  to  beat.  Just  get close enough for him to attack, then
dodge  his  attack,  and  when  his  eye turns yellow, hit it with your
Hookshot  or arrows. Repeat this until he dies, and open the chest that
appears to get another Fairy.


Now return back to the Owl Statue outside of this temple by playing the
Song  of  Soaring,  then rearrange the blocks once more by stepping and
cloning  on the switches in this order: Right, Left, Center. Now hop to
the  third block, and shoot the red emblem below you with a Light Arrow
to turn this Temple upside-down. Enter it again.

Run  forward  on  the rafters (you ARE upside-down ya know), and take a
right,  and  enter  the  door  to the right. Shoot the sun stone with a
Light  Arrow,  then  enter  another  room  where  you must use the Deku
Flowers  and  the  vents of air to "rise" to the occasion. Use the Deku
Flower  here, and use the air vents to fly all the way up to the center
bridge,  and enter the hallway with a switch at the end. Hit the switch
to make a chest appear, so run back to the chest and take the Small Key
from  inside of it. Now use the Deku Flower again (or just hop into the
vents  to  fly),  and fly up to the northwest corner of the room to the
ledge with some spikes hanging near it. Enter the door.


In this lava room, shoot the red emblem to turn the room right-side up,
then  run across the lava as Goron Link, and shoot the red emblem again
with  a  Light  Arrow  to  turn it back upside-down, and enter the next
door.  This room can be tricky. Start off by shooting the red emblem to
turn  the  room  around, then look for the fallen block. Push the block
ahead and next to the center path, and shoot the emblem again. Now push
the  block  across  the center of the room, and on the same side as the
hole  is.  Now  shoot the emblem once more, and push the block ahead as
far  as  it  will  go. Now flip the room around once more, and push the
block  into  the  hole,  climb up the block and hop onto the ledge, and
enter the door. Time for another boss fight.

What?  Wizrobe?!  Again?!?! This guy needs a life, big-time. Seriously,
his attacks are the same as before, but this time, he can stand atop of
a  high  ledge  and shoot fire at you...not good. To fight him the easy
way,  simply  stand  behind the semi-fenced area, so that his fireballs
won't  hit  you.  Now  just  aim for the small platform in front of you
where  there  is  no fence, and wait for him to stand there, then shoot
him with an arrow. Repeat this until he starts to spin around the room,
and use the same strategy until he dies.


A  chest  will appear with a Fairy, but to get to it, you must Hookshot
your  way  to  the  chest, take the Fairy, then head out the next door.
Alright,  use the Deku Flowers in here to fly across the room, and head
out  the door (remember this room though for later...), and in the next
room, shoot the spikes with your Hookshot to blow them up, and fly over
to  that  ledge  where  the  spikes were. Now look up and use the chest
above  you  to  Hookshot onto, and rise up to the next ledge. Enter the
door, avoid the Blue Bubbles (the Stone Mask works well), and enter the
next door to fight another boss battle, this time, for the Boss Key. Be
sure to have plenty of arrows and Magic for this fight.

                                 Boss: Gomess
§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

This  guy  isn't that hard, but it will be hard if you run out of Magic
and/or  arrows. He has tons of bats as a shield, so to get rid of them,
shoot  a  Light  Arrow at him then attack. He'll counter- attack, so be
ready  for it by raising your shield. If you run out of Magic, slash at
the  bats  to  get  some more. Repeat this strategy to kill Gomess, and
unlock the door with the Boss Key.


Take  it, and go back to the room with the Deku Flowers and the Poes in
it (the room before the room with the spikes and the Deku Flowers...the
room I told you to remember for later). Once in this room, use the Deku
Flower  to fly up to the ledge on your left. Put on the Stone Mask, and
run  through this small maze to find a switch on the floor. Step on it,
then  clone yourself. Now run to the chest that has been de-flamed, and
take  the  small  key. Go back to the room with the spikes and the Deku
Flower,  but  take a right instead of flying over to the ledge near the
spikes, and head out the door.


Across  from  you is a large Armos, so shoot it with a Light Arrow, hop
over  to it as Zora Link or normal Link with the Bunny Hood, defeat the
Armos,  and  step  on the switch to reveal a chest way above your head.
Hookshot that new chest above you, and enter the locked door to fight a
large  Eyegore.  This  fight  is  really  easy. Simply run at him while
defending  yourself  (come at him at an angle), and get so close to him
that he smashes the ground with his arms, and his eye turns yellow. Now
shoot  his eye with either some Arrows or the Hookshot, and repeat this
until  he  dies.  Now  a chest will appear, and it contains the Giant's
Mask, which you will need for the Temple Boss ahead.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A WORD OF ADVICE: YOU WILL NEED TONS OF MAGIC, SO IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA
TO  WARP  BACK TO CLOCK TOWN, USE YOUR ROMANI MASK AT THE MILK BAR, AND
BUY  SOME CHATEAU ROMANI MILK FOR 200 RUPEES. WHY? BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU
_UNLIMITED_  MAGIC POWER UNTIL YOU WARP BACK IN TIME, AND YOU WILL NEED
IT FOR THE TEMPLE BOSS. ALSO BE SURE TO GRAB SOME FAIRIES IN BOTTLES AS
WELL.  WHEN YOU ARE READY, GO BACK TO THE STONE TEMPLE (YOU MAY NEED TO
TURN IT UPSIDE-DOWN AGAIN).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Run  past  where you fought the Eyegore for the Giant's Mask, and enter
the room with the spike logs. Hit the crystal switch in front of you to
reveal a chest, then use the chest as a Hookshot target to get onto the
cage,  then  use  the Hookshot target ahead of you to fly over the next
spike log. Drop down to the ledge, and enter the boss door.

                         GIANT MASKED INSECT: TWINMOLD

Wow.  This  boss  battle  is  INCREDIBLY easy if you drink some Chateau
Romani  Milk  before-hand. Put on your Giant's Mask, and as Giant Link,
you  will  need to fight off the Giant Masked Insects. Their weak spots
are  their  tails,  and  the  tip of their heads/faces. Just run around
slashing  them  as  they fly past you, and as they enter or come out of
the ground. If you do not have and Chateau Romani, then hit the pillars
around the area to get some Magic for you. Don't run too far out of the
perimeter,  or else you will fall into the abyss, and have to start the
fight over.


After  you  have  killed both insects, shrink back down to normal Link,
take the Heart Piece, and enter the portal and take Twinmold's Remains!


Now  after  the  cinemas,  it's  time  to  meet  Skull Kid once and for
all...or  something.  To do this, you'll have to wait until 12AM on the
Final  Day  for the carnival to occur and the Clock Tower in Clock Town
to  open,  and  play  the  Oath  to  Order  song at the top to activate
something.  But  before you do this, go back in the game and collect as
many  Heart  Pieces  as  you  can, Stray Fairies from past temples, and
collect all 20 masks in the game (or the ones you don't have yet. Refer
to  the  "Masks" section in this FAQ to find out how to get each mask).
Also,  be  sure  to  take  this time to stock up on Rupees, and collect
plenty  of  Bottles, and get some Fairies in each one, and some Chateau
Romani Milk in one too. Be sure to get as many Bombchus as you can.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE ROMANI MASK, GET IT NOW!
YOU  WILL  NEED  IT  TO BUY SOME CHATEAU ROMANI MILK AT THE MILK BAR IN
CLOCK  TOWN  AFTER 10PM. YOU NEED THE CHEATEU ROMANI MILK FOR THE FINAL
BOSS FIGHT, AND SO YOU WILL BE ALMOST INVINCIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Now at midnight on Day 3, when the Clock Tower opens up, head up to it,
watch the cut-scene, and play the Ode to Order song on your Ocarina.

 007: The Final Frontier

===============================================================================

Welcome to the final area that you will have to defeat before facing the
final boss in Z:MM. The last area isn't that hard, but if you waste
Bombchus or arrows, you'll regret it later...BTW, be sure you have your
bottle of CHEATEU ROMANI MILK before entering this area...you'll thank
me later.

As  you enter the grassy area on the moon, you will find 4 kids running
around.  3  of them are wearing the Guardian Masks, and the last one is
sitting  near  the  tree,  wearing the Majora's Mask. If you want to go
directly to the final boss, then by all means, speak to him. But if you
want  4 more Heart Pieces and an extra all-powerful mask, then begin by
speaking  to  the kid wearing the mask of Odolwa, and give him one mask
to play his game of hide-and-seek.

Start  off  in  this  dungeon by turning into Deku Link, then using the
Deku  flower  to fly onto the first spinning Deku Flower platform, then
onto  the  next.  Now  fly  off  to the right-hand ledge to find a Deku
Flower,  then  return to the previous spinning Deku Flower, land on the
Gold  one,  and launch yourself to the left-hand ledge instead (the one
with  the door), enter the door, and give the kid one mask to exit back
into the grassy area.

Now  find  the  kid  wearing  the Goht's Remains mask, and give him two
masks  to  play  his  game, and enter this temple. Start off by turning
into Goron Link, and rolling down the first straight path, and once you
turn  into  spikes, let go of the control stick, but hold onto A still,
and  Goron  Link  will bounce off a few chests, and to some Green Pots.
Stop  there,  and  head across the bridge to the other side, turn left,
and  roll ahead, and to the slight left and over the bridge, then stop.
Now  use  this  long straightaway to launch yourself over the next gap,
release  the control stick once more, and bounce off the chest and onto
the  platform  with  a Heart Piece. Take it, head back onto the bridge,
and  fly  off  it with your spiked roll to the door, enter it, and give
the kid two more masks to exit.

Find  the  kid  wearing  Gyorg's  Remains mask, and give him 3 masks to
enter  this  temple.  Start  off by hopping into the pipe, then sinking
down to walk, and head down the first left, then right, then left, then
straight to find the Heart Piece. Continue forward to start off back at
the  beginning, and this time, go down the first left, then right, then
left  again,  then right to find the kid. Give him 3 more masks to exit
back onto the grassy area.

Now  locate  the  last  kid  wearing Twinmold's Remains, and give him 4
masks  to  enter  his  temple. In this temple, you will have to fight 3
mini-bosses  to  proceed. The first room has a Dinofol, the second room
has  a  Garo  Master, and the third room has an Iron Knuckle. After the
Iron  Knuckle  fight,  take  the Bombchus, and look to the right of the
chest  to  see  a  large crack on the upper wall. Use a Bombchu on this
crack to reveal a ladder switch, so hit it, then climb up the ladder to
find a Heart Piece, then go through the next door to find the kid. Give
him your last 4 masks to exit.


Once  back  outside,  talk  to the kid near the tree to fight the final
boss.  If  you  gave  away  all  of your Masks, then he'll give you the
mighty  Fierce Deity's Mask, but if you did not, then he will just tell
you that you have weak masks, and allow you to enter the boss area.

This  first  phase  is  probably  the hardest phase, because of so much
going  on  around you. To begin with, you might need to save arrows, so
instead  of using arrows on the Mask (his weak spot is behind his mask,
which  is hard to get to with arrows), turn into Zora Link and use your
Boomerangs  to  hit him when he stops in mid-air. When he falls, attack
him.  After  a while, the other Guardian Masks will attack you, so take
them down with some arrows, then focus on Majora's Mask once more. When
he  starts to shoot Fire, IMMEDIATELY turn into normal Link, because if
you  get  touched by ANY fire at all as Zora Link, it's all over. Avoid
his  fire  attacks as best as you can, and continue your attack methods
until he goes down, and changes phases...


§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§

This  is  the easiest phase out of this boss fight, because this phase,
the  Incarnation  doesn't  attack  much, because he's too busy prancing
around the room. Wait for him to stop moving around, and when he stops,
shoot  him with an arrow to bring him down, then attack. If you are out
of  arrows,  turn  into  Zora  Link, and use your Zora Shield attack to
knock  him out by getting close to him (hold R to shield yourself, then
hold  down  B to bring out your electrical shield). Repeat this process
until the Incarnation dies off, and transforms into...


§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§=§
                            MAJORA'S WRATH (Part 3)

This  WOULD be the hardest phase out of them all, if you tried out this
first method of attack. His main attacks are his whips, which can reach
Link  from  almost  anywhere in this confined area. Your shield doesn't
help  much, but if you can get the shot off, shoot a Light Arrow at him
to stun him, then run at him, and attack. This method is OKAY, but this
next  technique is much better, IMHO, and you don't take much damage at
all with it:

For an easier time with Majora's Wrath, simply turn into Zora Link, and
hold  down  R  for the ENTIRE fight, only bringing it down when you are
attacking Majora when he is stunned. To stun him, simply hold down R to
block  his tenticles, and when you get close to him, hold B at the same
time  to bring out your electrical Zora Shield, and this will stun him.
Before  taking  out  your  Zora  Shield,  drink  your bottle of Cheateu
Romani.  Now  attack  him  as  either  Zora Link or normal Link (do the
latter  if you have the Gilded or Fairy's Sword, to cause more damage),
and  attack  him  until  he  gets back up. Towards the end of his life,
he'll  send  out spinning razors that explode after a while, so be sure
to  avoid  these,  or hit them so they hit each other, and blow up. Now
repeat  your  Zora  Link  techniques,  and after a long while and after
dishing  out  TONS  of  damage  to  Majora,  he'll  die  off. BTW, this
technique  is VERY useful to you if you have a bottle of Chateau Romani
milk,  and  when you have run out of arrows, because then you will have
Unlimited  Magic  Power  for  the  entire  fight,  and  will  almost be
invincible!


Now  sit  back, and enjoy the ending movie and credits!!! I know I sure
as hell did. :P

08. Heart Piece Locations

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Just like in Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Z:OoT), there are several Heart Pieces
(or Pieces of Heart, as the game likes to call them), scattered around the
world of Termina. These are ESSENTIAL to your success in the game, because
they will heal Link, and will add to his health meter (number of hearts at
the top of the screen) over time. One Heart Piece is equal to 1/4th of
a Full Heart Container (once again, those hearts at the top of your screen),
and four Heart Pieces will form to make a Full Heart Container, thus adding
to your health bar, and increasing your chances of not dying by a margin.



===============================================================================
                                • Clock Town •
===============================================================================

#1: This one is just above the entrance to South Clock Town, and north of the
    Gold Deku Flower, on a ledge with a colorful clock. Use the Gold Deku
    Flower to launch yourself to it on the high ledge.

#2: In North Clock Town, on top of the tree to the right of the slide that
    is near the East Clock Town entrance. Climb up the slide, then hop from
    platform to platform to get to it. You need the Bunny Hood to get to
    this Heart Piece.

#3: After getting the Bunny Hood, follow the mailman around Clock Town until
    he stops in the Post Office, and starts to train. Talk to him to play
    his game, in which you have to stop the timer on exactly 10 seconds.
    If you do this, he will reward you with a Heart Piece.

#4: Go to the Mailbox in South Clock Town, and if you have the Postman's Hat,
    then wear it, and search the mailbox, and you should find a Heart Piece
    inside of it! If not, then you'll just find some Rupees, so check another
    Mailbox.

#5: Use the Kamoro Mask, and enter East Clock Town. Find the two sisters who
    are dancing together, and put the mask on. Now talk to them, and press
    B to teach them a new dance! They will be so happy that you have done
    this, that they will give you a Heart Piece!

#6: This heart piece is inside of the Mighty Training Center in West Clock
    Town. To get it, you will have to enter the Expert Course, and pay
    the guy 10 Rupees. If you get a perfect score, then you will be rewarded
    with a Heart Piece.

#7: Head to the Stock Pot Inn in East Clock Town, and head upstairs to the
    bathroom area at 12AM (midnight), and you will see a hand coming out
    of the toilet (or the small hole). Talk to it, and it will ask for
    some paper, so give it the Land Title Deed, and you will get a Heart
    Piece.

#8: Head to the Town Shooting Gallery in East Clock Town, and play the game
    for 20 Rupees. Remember the rules: Hit as many Red Octoroks as you
    can, and don't hit any Blue Octoroks, or you will lose points. To
    get your Heart Piece, get a score of 50 points, and the guy will
    hand you a Heart Piece as your prize.

#9: To get this Heart Piece, go to Honey & Darling's Shop, and play each game
    on each different day. If you can beat the high score for each of the
    three games for all three days, you will be rewarded with a Heart Piece!

#10: As Deku Link, go to the Deku Scrub Playground in North Clock Town by
     using the Deku Flower near the Great Fairy Fountain to launch over
     to the hole in the ground, which leads to this Playground. Go here
     anytime between 6 and 12AM to play the game. Your goal here is to
     nab all of the Rupees from the platforms, all while NOT hitting the
     ground. Use the Deku Flowers to do this with success. If you play
     this game, and get the fastest time for three days in a row, you
     will get a Heart Piece.

#11: Go to the Observatory, and search to the left of the Clock Tower, and
     you should see a Deku Scrub flying  around. He'll eventually land
     inside of a underground hole near the Observatory, so exit the
     Observatory, and make your way to this hole in Termina Field.
     Inside, you can buy a Heart Piece for 150 Rupees! Or, if you do
     not want to buy it for that much, just say no, and he'll try to
     sell it to you for 100 Rupees!

#12: As Goron Link, go to Clock Town, and enter the Treasure Chest Shop,
     and play the game by going through the maze, and make your way through
     the maze, and to the chest at the end before the time limit ends.
     If you do this as Goron Link, you will get a Heart Piece!

#13: When you wear the Keaton Mask around some of the "alive" bushes in North
     Clock Town (and other areas), then attack them all before they dissapear,
     a Keaton will come out, and ask you some questions...a quiz containing of
     5 random questions. If you answer them correctly, you will get a Piece of
     Heart!

#14: To get this Heart Piece, you'll need the Couple's Mask. Once you have this
     mask, head to the Mayor's Residence, and speak with the Mayor while
     wearing the mask, and you will break up his meeting. As a reward for doing
     this, he'll give you a Heart Piece.

#15: This Heart Piece is really easy to get. Just put on the All-Night Mask,
     and head into the Stock Pot Inn, and listen to the Grandmother tell
     you the "Carnival of Time" story. At the end of the stort, answer:
     "On the Eve of the Festival", and she'll give you a Heart Piece

#16: Now for this Heart Piece, do the same thing as the above Heart Piece,
     but this time, listen to "The Four Giant's" story, and at the end when
     she asks you the question, answer: "I dunno". She'll give you a Heart
     Piece for listening so hard! </Grandmother>

#17: Simply collect 5,000 Rupees total, and store them all in the Clock Town
     bank in East Clock Town. Once you have collected 5,000 or more Rupees,
     the banker will be so proud of you, he'll give you a Heart Piece as
     interest for sticking with him after all those Rupees.


===============================================================================
                               • Termina Field •
===============================================================================

#18: This one is in Termina Field, right outside of the Romain Ranch entrance,
     and before the Milk Road Entrance. It's hidden in the tall grass, but
     you can find it by walking around the area surrounded by butterflies.
     Once you fall in (it must be during the day-time), and kill the
     flying Pea Pod. Once this is over, a chest will be revealed, and
     a Heart Piece is inside it.

#19: This Piece is inside a hole outside of the northern exit of Clock Town, in
     the snowy area, just past the ramp you run down, and it's near one of
     those mushroom shaped rocks (like where you got Kamaro's Mask). Inside,
     there are two Dodongos. Concentrate on one of them first, then the other.
     To defeat them, just wait for them to shoot fire at you, then circle
     around them to their tales, attack with a jumping slash, defend with
     your shield right away, because they'll spin around and hit you
     with their tale, then repeat. After both of them are defeated, you
     will get a chest containing a Heart Piece!

#20: This Heart Piece lies inside a hole, which is beneath a giant rock by the
     Ocean. Blow it up with a bomb, then hop into the hole. Inside you will
     find some Deku Plants that are underwater. Kill them with some arrows,
     then shoot down all 3 of the bee-hives hanging way above them on the roof
     and you will get a Heart Piece, but this can only be accessed as Zora
     Link, because the Heart Piece is so deep under the water.

#21: To get this heart piece, you must first locate the four hidden underground
     holes in Termina Field that feature 4 Gossip Stones, 1 of them being
     larger than normal. Now just play your specific character's "special" song
     to the large Gossip Stones (Deku Link's would be the Sonata of Awakening,
     and so on...) in each of the four holes, and you will get this Piece of
     Heart. The hole locations are:

       - One hole is to the right of the entrance to the snowy area in Termina
         Field, right outside of North Clock Town. Easy to find

       - One hole is beneath a rock near the Beach area, just outside of East
         Clock Town

       - One hole is near the entrance to Southern Swamp, just past the large
         spherical tree with a hidden hole under it. This hole is right on
         the edge of the high grass

       - This hole is to the left of the Observatory, right near the fence.

===============================================================================

#22: This one is on top of a large black tree near the hole in the ground on
     the path that leads to Southern Swamp. Kill the bat on the vines before
     climbing up to the top of the tree.

#23: This Heart Piece is in Southern Swamp, and on top of the roof of the
     house. Give the Land Title Deed to the Deku Scrub here to gain access
     to the Deku Flower here, then glide to the roof and nab the Heart Piece.

#24: This one can be gotton from the Tourist guy in the Tourist Info. Center
     in the Swamp. Just take a pic of the King Deku, and take the photo back
     to him to receive your Heart Piece.

#25: This one can be obtained after defeating the Woodfall Temple. After doing
     so, return back  to  the Tourist Information Center in the Southern
     Swamp  area, and speak with Kotake in there. Take the boat ride, and on
     the  way,  you will be allowed to play her mini-game. There is a target
     on  the  back  of the boat (Kotake actually has the target on her broom
     and  she's  following the boat), and your goal is to hit the targets at
     least 20 times. If you hit Kotake more than 10 times, you lose. Hit the
     targets  20  times or more, and Kotake will give you a Heart Piece! The
     game is 10 Rupees to play if you lose the first time, so be ready...

#26: This Heart Piece is on a platform to the left of the entrance to Woodfall
     Swamp. First, head over to the Owl Statue that is near the entracne to
     the Woodfall Temple, then use the Deku Flower here and fly to the north,
     and to the next Deku Flower. Be sure to kill the Deku Scrubs as you go
     too. Continue to fly from platform to platform, until you reach a
     platform with a large chest on top (the platform should be near the
     entrance). Open the chest, and you will find a Heart Piece!

#27: To get this Heart Piece, simply go to the Swamp Shooting Gallery in
     Southern Swamp, and play the game of shooting the Deku Scrubs. To
     get the highest score (over 2,000 points), you'll need to shoot
     every Deku Scrub, and if you do it one time, you'll get a Quiver
     Upgrade, but do it a second time to get a Heart Piece.

Bomber's Notebook
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This nifty little item allows Link to keep track of other people's scheduals
on each of the three days (1st, 2nd, and Final), and lets Link keep track

Use this if your Magic Power is low. But first, you'll need an empty bottle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant's Wallet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A larger wallet than the Adult Wallet, the Giant's Wallet allows Link to carry
up to 500 Rupees at a time. This is almost essential to the game, because you
won't be able to collect all of the masks without it.

boulders that cannot be blown up by normal bombs. The Powder Keg can only be
used as Goron Link.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chateau Romani Milk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra-special milk, the Chateau Romani increases your health, and it also gives
you unlimited Magic Power (your Magic Bar will turn blue) until you go back
in time. This item is VERY useful for some areas in the game.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gold Dust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This extra-rare (not to mention special) dust is made out of a rare gold from
the Mountains, and can be used to create even the strongest metals. Use
this at the Mountain Smithy to upgrade your sword to the Gilded Sword.

11. Empty Bottle Locations

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1: Defeat the Skull Kid on top of the Clock Tower in South Clock Town, then
    head to the Southern Swamp area near Woodfall, and enter the Woods of
    Mystery. Follow the monkey to Kotake the witch, who needs some red
    potion for energy. Leave the Woods of Mystery, and speak to Koume inside
    of her Potion Shop, and get the Red Potion in a bottle for Kotake. Give
    the Potion to Kotake in the Woods of Mystery, and you will be allowed
    to keep the empty bottle!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2: To get this bottle, head to the Romani Ranch after 1AM and around 2AM
    on the First Day, and speak to Romani, the ranch girl, then follow her
    into the barn. Now, leave the barn, and wait for the UFOs to come from
    the sky, and shoot them down with your Hero's Bow until Dawn of the Second
    Day, and she'll give you some Chateau Romani inside of a bottle!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3: To get this bottle, defeat Goht, and the entire Snowhead Temple. Afterwards,
    the entire Goron Village and Mountain Village will become normal again,
    and the snow will have melted. This will open up the path in Goron Village
    that leads to a Biggoron who sells Powder Kegs to Gorons, so enter there
    as Goron Link, and take the Powder Keg from him. Now take it to the
    entrance of Mountain Village, and up the hills and place it in front of
    the large boulder blocking the Goron Races, near the small Goron. It will
    blow up, allowing you to enter the Goron Races. Enter the race, and win
    the race to get some Gold Dust, which comes in a Bottle!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4: To get this bottle, you must have beaten the Great Bay Temple, and have
    defeated Gyorg, the boss of this Temple. Once this is done with, head
    onto the shore with the Skulltula House and the Fisherman's Hut, and
    head to the right of these two houses, and through the hole in the
    cave, and to the other side, onto the next beach. Continue along the beach,
    past the Zoras, and until you reach a large piece of wood that you can
    climb onto in the sand. Head onto it, and hookshot your way to the platform
    above you, the one with the palm tree on it, and use the palm tree as
    a target for your hookshot. Now continue to do this for all of the palm
    tree platforms in this area, until you reach a hole in the wall near a
    waterfall. Enter it to be in Waterfall Rapids. Once here, dive into the
    water as Zora Link, and talk to the beaver at the floor of the water.
    He'll ask you if you want to race for a Empty Bottle, so agree. Now
    you only have 2 minutes to swim through 20 rings underwater (swim through
    the ones that are spinning, and stay close behind the beaver), and if
    you do this in under 2 minutes, the other beaver will then challenge
    you. Now you have to swim through 25 rings in under 2 minutes. This
    is a bit more challenging, but nothing you can't do. After doing this,
    the beavers will give up, and give you an Empty Bottle.

#5: To get this bottle, complete the massive trading sequence to reunite Anju
    and Kafei up to where you have to deliver Mama's Letter, then deliver
    the Letter to Mama in the Milk Bar while wearing Kafei's Mask, and she'll
    give you a Bottle with Chateau Romani!

#6: To get this final bottle, enter the Ikana Graveyard on the Final Day after
    6PM, and enter with the Captain's Hat. Now tell the Stalchildren to
    open the grave they are dancing around, and enter the grave. Inside, you
    will find Dampe, and he's looking for the buried treasure. To get this
    treasure, you'll have to lead his SLOW ass to each of the 6 dirt patches
    down here. There are 5 on the ground, and the last one is on top of
    a pillar near a ladder. To lead Dampe up here, simply lead him onto
    the brown platform that moves, then climb up the ladder on the other
    side of the area to meet him up on the dirt patch. After he's dug up
    all 6 dirt patches (3 of them will reveal parts of a poe...), a
    Big Poe will come out, and you'll have to fight it. To beat it, simply
    block his spin attack, then when it stops, shoot it with an arrow,
    then do a 180 to spot the Poe again, and repeat until it dies. Now
    a chest will be revealed, and inside is an Empty Bottle!

|                          | things up without using bombs. You can blow up  |
|                          | anything that a regular bomb can, but Link will |
|                          | take damage from the explosion.                 |
|                          |                                                 |

The Song of Time saves your game for you, and returns you to Dawn of the First

Playing this song allows Link to warp to any Owl Statue (save point) that

Link automatically knows this song, but it can be "learned" from the scarecrow
in either the Observatory or the Trading Post in Clock Town.


What does this song do?
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Inversed Song of Time actually SLOWS down the flow of time in the game,
therefore giving you more time to complete tasks, and slow down the moon's
fall to the planet. Playing the song again returns the flow of time back
to normal.

Village,  in  Mountain  Village,  then  enter the Goron Shrine in Goron
Village  by  Do  the  Goron Stomp, which is A + B together, to open it.
Enter  Goron  Shrine.  Head to the north, and speak to the crying baby,
then  go  back  to  the  old Goron you un-froze. She's frozen again, so
unfreeze  her  once  more.  Talk  to her, and she'll teach you only the
first  part of the Goron's Lullaby, which is the Lullaby Intro! Now run
back to the baby inside of the Goron Shrine, and play the Lullaby Intro
to  it.  The  baby  will  then teach you the second part, and learn the
Goron Lullaby!


What does this song do?
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This song basically puts Gorons to sleep and such, and it will be used
to get to certain Heart Pieces, and enter dungeons, like Snowhead
Dungeon, as well as other things.

and she'll teach you this song.


What does this song do?
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Just like in Z:OoT, playing Epona's Song makes Epona come to you whenever
you want her to, and she'll come to you anywhere in Termina Field, even
if you have lost her.

this song.

This song is a very cool song which allows Link to create a exact
statue replica of Link's form (one statue can be made for each
form, therefore creating at least 4 different statues at once).

14. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

===============================================================================
1. Q: How many different forms can Link take on?
===============================================================================

Link can only take on 3 different forms that vary from the 'normal' Link:

- Deku Link
- Goron Link
- Zora Link
- Oni Link (with the Fierce Deity Mask)


===============================================================================
2. Q: Does this game REALLY need the Expansion Pak to play?
===============================================================================

In a word, yes. You absolutely need the Expansion Pak to play Zelda: Majora's
Mask. If you don't have one, GET ONE, or else you will not be able to play
this gem.


===============================================================================
3. Q: Does the Day timer that counts the time stop when you pause the game?
===============================================================================

Yes it does. The game time stops when you pause the game, and it also stops
during cut-scenes, and when you speak to people or check out something.


===============================================================================
4. Q: Do you lose all of your items when you play the Song of Time, and return
      to the first day?
===============================================================================
Well, sorta. You will lose some lesser items, like the Moon's Tear and other
stuff like your Rupees, Deku Nuts, Magic Beans, etc. Things that you will not
lose are more key items, like Heart Pieces, the Camera, Masks, etc...


===============================================================================
5. Q: How many total masks are there to collect?
===============================================================================
There are 24 total masks; 4 masks that actually transform Link into
something different than human (like a Deku, or a Goron), and there are
20 'normal' masks that do not transform Link into anything (like the Bunny
Hood, which just makes Link run faster and jump further). Also, there are
4 more Guardian Masks that you get as you defeat each dungeon, and a "special"
mask that you can get towards the end of the game.


===============================================================================
6. Q: How many fairies are hidden within each dungeon/temple?
===============================================================================
There are exactly 15 hidden fairies within each dungeon/temple in the
game. When you find them all, you will be rewarded by the Great Fairy of
Magic.


===============================================================================
7. Q: How do I catch these Fairies?
===============================================================================
Simple. Just put on the Great Fairy Mask whenever you get near one of these
fairies (they're pink), and they will come to you. Just be sure that you are
close enough to them so they will notice your mask.


===============================================================================
8. Q: If I beat a Dungeon, will I have to return to it later on?
===============================================================================
Technically, no you don't. But if you are like me, and want to get EVERYTHING
in the game, then yes, you will have to return to some (or all) of the
Dungeons in the game later on in the game when you have more masks, and
therefore more power to enter areas previously inaccessible. Why? Simple.
So you can get the Stray Fairies that you might have missed last time you
were in the Dungeon/Temple. ^_^


===============================================================================
9. Q: What's the Inverted Song of Time?
===============================================================================
The Inverted Song of Time is just like the normal Song of Time, but as the
name implies, it's use is inverted, so instead of returning you to the First
Day and speeding time up to return you back in time, it actually SLOWS down
the flow of time.


===============================================================================
10. Q: When/where/why can I use the Inverted Song of Time?
===============================================================================
So far, from my experience, I have found that you can play the Inverted
Song of Time on any day. I found out (after experimenting a bit), that you
can play the Song of Time almost anywhere for it to take effect. Some
areas that it will not work in is inside some shops, or anything indoors
(well, almost anything indoors).


===============================================================================
11. Q: Does the appearance of a Dungeon return to the way it used to be after
       I play the Song of Time and return to the First Day, even AFTER I
       beat the dungeon?
===============================================================================
Yes, it does. But don't worry about it. If you wish to return to an area, and
want that area to return to it's state that it was AFTER you beat the dungeon,
simply re-enter the temple/dungeon, and fight the boss over. If you do this,
and beat the boss again, everything will return to it's "good" state once
more.


===============================================================================
12. Q: How do I get the Giant's Wallet, and carry up to 500 Rupees?
===============================================================================
Simply get the hookshot, then enter the Oceanside Spider House in Great Bay
Coast, and collect all 30 Skulltula Tokens to release the curse on the house,
and earn a Giant's Wallet (NOTE: One catch though: You can only release the
curse on the First Day to get the Giant's Wallet. The other days, you will
only get some Rupees.)


===============================================================================
13. Q: Where can I get <insert item here>?
===============================================================================
Read the walkthrough to find that item, or if you are too lazy to check there,
why don't you just check out the Item List in this FAQ? Yeah? Good.


===============================================================================
14. Q: Are there any "secret" dungeons?
===============================================================================
Technically, yes, there are a few. What are they you ask? Well, these "secret"
dungeons are the two Spider Houses in the game (one of them is inside of the
Southern Swamp, and the other one is inside of Great Bay Coast...they're easy
to find). They area considered to be "secret", because they are not needed
to complete the game, but they are rather side-quests, and not full-fledged
dungeons. But one thing: These Spider Houses are pretty small, so don't be
suprised if you can get through them in 10-20 minutes.


===============================================================================
15. Q: Are there limitations to what every item, in the amount that I can
       hold at once?
===============================================================================
Yes. And here is the maximum number of each item that you can carry at once
as Link:

 ______________________
|                      |
| Limits               |
|______________________|
|                      |
| Deku Nuts........ 30 |
|                      |
| Arrows........... 50 |
|                      |
| Bombs............ 40 |
|                      |
| Deku Sticks...... 20 |
|                      |
|______________________|


===============================================================================
16. Q: Can I only perform certain Side-Quests and/or Mini-Games on certain
       days?
===============================================================================
Sometimes, yes. There are some certain Side-Quests that require you to do
certain actions on a certain day and/or time in order to complete these
Side-Quests, as well as some parts of the main game (the parts that you need
to complete to beat the game itself.)


===============================================================================
17. Q: Do I need to collect every mask to beat the game?
===============================================================================
No, you do not need to collect every single mask to complete the
game...however, if you want to view the "perfect" or "good" ending to the
game, then yes, you must collect all 24 Masks in the game. Also, you'll need
all 20 normal masks to get the last special Mask, as well as 4 more Heart
Pieces at the end of the game. Good luck!


===============================================================================
18. Q: How many different endings are there in the game?
===============================================================================
There is only one ending. Trust me, I've beaten the game two ways:

- Once by NOT getting all of the masks, and beating the final boss the HARD
  way

- And once by getting all of the masks, getting the Fiery Deity Mask, and
  beating the final boss the EASY way

There is only one ending, and there is no way to change that.


===============================================================================
19. Q: What do I lose/keep when I play the Song of Time and return to the Dawn
       of Day 1?
===============================================================================

What you keep: Heart Pieces, Masks, Songs on your Ocarina, Special Items
              (Quiver, Giant's Wallet, Gilded Sword, etc.), Compasses and
               Dungeon Maps

What you lose: Non-special items (Rupees, Magic Beans, Arrows, Deku
Sticks/Nuts, Bombs, etc.), Keys (both boss and small), and stray fairies


===============================================================================
20: Q: When I'm on the moon, do I get to keep whatever I get there, even
       after I beat the game?
===============================================================================
Yes, you get to keep most of what you collect there. You'll get to keep
whatever Heart Pieces you have collected, as well as the Fierce Deity Mask
By "keeping", I mean that after you have beaten the game, and you shut off
the power on the system (there's no way to go back; you have to shut off the
power), and you boot up your game again, you will still have your Heart Pieces
from the Moon, as well as the Fierce Deity Mask.


===============================================================================
21. Q: Where can I use the Fierce Deity Mask?
===============================================================================
You can only use the Fierce Deity Mask in Boss Arenas and during Boss Fights.
You can't use it anywhere else, but there is a glitch that allows you to
wear it in Clock Town. It's in KyleShi's Zelda: MM FAQ, I believe...


===============================================================================
22. Q: I know this sounds like a dumb question, but how to I put the Zora Eggs
       inside of the Aquarium in the Marine Research Center?
===============================================================================
Simple. Just stand on the aquarium, and hold down on the control stick, then
press the C-Button that has your bottle with the Zora Egg on it, and Link
should dump it into the tank.


===============================================================================
23. Q: I have talked to the kid wearing the Majora's Mask near the tree on
       The Moon, but he won't give me the Fierce Deity Mask. Why?
===============================================================================
Did you speak to the other 4 kids wearing the Guardian Masks? Did you collect
all 20 of the normal masks? Did you give away all of your masks by defeating
all of the 4 small-dungeons on the Moon? If you answered "no" to any of the
above questions, then that is why you did not get the Fierce Deity Mask.


===============================================================================
24. Q: Can I use this FAQ on my site?
===============================================================================
Yes. You DO NOT have to ask (unless you are www.megagames.com) if you can use
it. Just e-mail me saying that you are using it, and give me the URL of the
site.


===============================================================================
25. Q: How do I get into Romani Ranch on any day other than Day 3? It's always
       blocked by a large boulder...
===============================================================================
Just beat the Snowhead Temple, and then go to the Bomb Shop in Clock Town as
Goron Link, and purchase a Powder Keg from the Goron there for 50 Rupees, and
use this Powder Keg on the boulder, and open the path to Romani Ranch.


===============================================================================
26. Q: Can I HTML-ize your FAQ?
===============================================================================
No. Read the Legal Stuff section for more info about this specific topic.


===============================================================================
26. Q: In the Deku Palace, when I try to save the monkey, and I try to use
       my Ocarina of Time to play his song like he tells me to, he says it's
       too small. What do I need to use?
===============================================================================
Switch to Deku Link, and use your Deku-instrument (horns or whatever they are).
This will allow you to learn his song (Song of Awakening).


===============================================================================
27. Q: You know that bird that flies around Termina Field? Well, it stole my
       <insert hilarious item name here>. Is there anyway I can get it back?
===============================================================================
Well, the only way that I know how to get it back is to find that damn bird,
and kill it. If you do this, then you'll get your item that it stole from you,
plus a Gold Rupee, worth 200 Rupees. Or, if you can't kill it, simply either
go buy your item(s) back at the Curiosity Shop right after it steals it from
you, or just warp back to Day 1 to regain any lost items.


===============================================================================
28. Q: Okay, it's about that bird again. What stuff does it take from you?
===============================================================================
From my experience (and from some e-mail that I've received), here are some
of the items that the bird enjoys stealing:

- Small items (bombs, arrows, etc...)
- Your sword
- Bottles
- Your Ocarina

in Z:MM, and although not all of them are required to beat the game, it is
recommended that you DO complete them. ^_^;


===============================================================================
 0001: Hide and Seek (Clock Town)
===============================================================================

For this mini-game, you must locate and find all 5 hidden boys who are hiding
all throughout Clock Town. Do so, and they will give you the password to
their secret hideout. Start off by heading to North Clock Town to start
the game.

There are two of them here already. One is behind the tree near the
mailbox, and the other is up the hill, behind a wall. Chase them both
when they run away, then capture them. The other two are to the east of
here, through the doorway near the mailbox. One is on the roof with a
chicken, so when he flies off, follow him and chase him to capture him. The
other one is on the straw roof, so find the Deku Flower, and glide up to him
and capture him. Now head to the west side of Clock Town, to West Clock Town.
He's just standing there, so grab him, and he'll give you the code for thier
hideout.


===============================================================================
 0002: The Gilded Sword
===============================================================================

To get this awesome sword, you must first have beaten the Snowhead Temple
near Snowhead, then as Goron Link, head to the Biggoron selling Powder
Keg, and use it to unblock the large boulder near the baby Goron in
Mountian Village, then enter the hole and enter the Goron Race. Now
race your fellow Gorons as Goron Link, and if you win, you will get some
Gold Dust in a bottle. Be sure you have least 100 Rupees with your then
take it to Mountain Village, and to the Mountain Smithy log cabin here.
Have the Rupees ready...now use this 100 Rupees to reforge your sword to
get  the  Razor  Sword! Wait until morning for them to finish the job,
then re-enter the cabin. Now speak to them again, and he'll ask for the
Gold Dust, and when it says press a C-button to pull out an item, press
the  C-Button  that has your Gold Dust on it, and he'll do it for free.
Come back the next morning to get the Gilded Sword!

 0004: Clock Town Bank
===============================================================================

There is a man in West Clock Town who runs a bank. What he does is reward
you with certain items each time you deposit a certain amount of Rupees
into his bank. There are certain rewards you get for a certain amount of
Rupees, which are:

200 Rupees.............Adult Wallet
Every 1,000 Rupees.....Blue Rupee (worth 5 Rupees)
5,000 Rupees...........Heart Piece

I suggest taking the time to collect at least 200 Total Rupees from outer
Termina, so you can get the Adult Wallet, because you will need it to advance
in the game.


===============================================================================
 0005: Underground Holes
===============================================================================

Remember those underground holes you found in Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Well,
they're back in Majora's Mask, and they too are scattered around the entire
kingdom of Termina! Sometimes holes are just right out in the open, and
sometimes they are hidden (concealed by rocks, tall grass, etc...). Sometimes
the holes can have a useless quality, or sometimes they can contain great
and valuble items, like Rupees or even Heart Pieces! Remember, when searching
for hidden holes, look for butterflies flying around grassy areas, or just
flying around period; this is usually a give-away for a hidden hole. Or,
if you have a Rumble Pak, you can still feel hidden holes when the Rumble
Pak shakes (I guess Link still has the Stone of Agony...). Good hunting!


#1: This one is in Termina Field, right outside of the Romain Ranch entrance,
    and before the Milk Road Entrance. It's hidden in the tall grass, but
    you can find it by walking around the area surrounded by butterflies.
    Once you fall in (it must be during the day-time), and kill the
    flying Pea Pod. Once this is over, a chest will be revealed, and
    a Heart Piece is inside it.

#2: This one is also located in Termina Field, and is just outside the north
    exit of Clock Town, and is in North Termina Field. It contains 4 Gossip
    Stones, as well as some bugs running around.

#3: This hole is near a tree on the path in Woodfall Swamp. Inside, you can
    find some Deku Babas who yield some Deku Sticks, as well as a chest
    containing a Red Rupee worth 20 Rupees!

#4: This hole is in the first part of the Woods of Mystery, the first part
    to the right. Inside it is a chest containing a Purple Rupee, worth
    a whopping 50 Rupees!

#5: This hole is hidden at the end of the maze to the left/right of the
    Royal Chamber inside the Deku Palace. It contains a Magic Bean seller,
    and a soft-soil spot.

#6: This hole is outside of the Royal Chamber, and it's on an island to the
    right of the Royal Chamber, inside the Deku Palace. It contains a chest
    with a Red Rupee, worth 20 Rupees.

#7: This hole is sorta like hole #1, in that it only contains some Gossip
    Stones and some bugs, as well as some plants which can be slashed at
    for some easy items and Rupees. It is located on the outer perimeter
    of the Observatory, but on the outside of the Observatory fence. It
    can only be accessed from Termina Field, and NOT the Observatory itself.

 #8: This is a hole that can only be accessed with a bomb and a Rumble
     Pak (well, you need a Rumble Pak to detect it). Exit out of the
     southern exit of Clock Town, and run towards the Swamp area.
     On the way, run underneath the rounded tree, and you should feel
     your Rumble Pak shake. Stand underneath it, and place a bomb
     on the ground to reveal this hole. Inside, there are TONS of
     plants which yield Rupees, Bombs, Arrows, etc., as well as
     2, count 'em, 2 cows! Yikes! Use this area to stock up on any
     items you are low on, and to fill up your empty bottles with
     nice, healthy milk.

#9: This hole is outside of the northern exit of Clock Town, in the snowy
    area, just past the ramp you run down, and it's near one of those
    mushroom shaped rocks (like where you got Kamaro's Mask). Inside, there
    are two Dodongos. Concentrate on one of them first, then the other.
    To defeat them, just wait for them to shoot fire at you, then circle
    around them to their tails, attack with a jumping slash, defend with
    your shield right away, because they'll spin around and hit you
    with their tail, then repeat. After both of them are defeated, you
    will get a chest containing a Heart Piece!

#10: This hole is hidden beneath a giant rock, in Termina Field, just north
     of the Eastern Exit of Clock Town (in east Termina Field). Bomb the
     rock with a bomb, and the hole will be revealed. Hop inside, and you
     will find that this hidden hole contains some Gossip Stones and some bugs,
     as well as some plants which can be slashed at for some easy items and
     Rupees.

#11: This hole is inside of the Mountain Village, and near the Goron Village.
     It's just past Tingle on the bridge, and is on a small, snowy platform
     near the entrance to Goron Village.  It's frozen over with ice, so use
     some hot, steam water to un-freeze it, then hop in. Inside, you will
     find some large rocks which can be blown up to get some easy Rupees,
     as well as a pond of Hot Steam Water at your disposal. This is a great
     time-saver, because now you don't have to go ALL the way back to the
     Goron Graveyard to get some hot water if you need it!

#12: This hole is rather easy to find. It's in North Clock Town, and you need
     to use the nearby Deku Flower to reach it, because it is inside of a
     fenced off area near the Great Fairy Fountain. Inside, you will find
     the Deku Scrub Playground, where you can play for a Heart Piece!

#13: This hole is in Mountain Village, but can only be accessed after defeating
     Goht in the Snowhead Temple, and as Goron Link. When all of the snow has
     melted away, a new path will open up next to the invisible ladder, so
     take that tunnel with Goron Link. After a while of climbing the ramps,
     you will find a hole in the ground. Hop in, and inside there is a chest
     containing a Red Rupee, worth 20 Rupees!

#14: This hole lies beneath a giant rock by the Ocean. Blow it up with a
     bomb, then hop into the hole. Inside you will find some Deku Plants
     that are underwater. Kill them with some arrows, and you will get
     a Heart Piece, but this can only be accessed as Zora Link, because
     the Heart Piece is so deep under the water...

#15: This hole is hidden within the circle of rocks in Ikano Graveyard. Place
     a bomb in the center of this circle to reveal a hidden hole. It contains
     a chest with some Bombchus (5 of them).

 0006: Getting Epona Back!
===============================================================================

To get Epona back, you must first complete the Snowhead Temple, and return
Goron Village and Mountain Village back to normal. Now, enter the Goron
Races, win, then buy a Powder Keg from the Biggoron in Goron Village, and
take it to Milk Road on the First Day, and blow up the boulder blocking the
path to Romani Ranch. Enter the Ranch, and speak to Romani, the girl outside.
She'll tell you about "them", who come every year before the carnival, and
tell you that they steal her cows. Now, she'll ask if you would like to try
your hand at being her assistant, so agree, then play her training game.
Shoot all 10 of the balloons around the ranch while on Epona in under 1
minute, and she'll teach you a new song, Epona's Song! Now play it, and you
will get Epona back!

 0007: Great Fairy Fountain Rewards
===============================================================================

You know all of those Stray Fairies that you've been collecting in each of
the dungeons/temples? Well, you're not collecting them for no reason. It's
a good thing that you've been collecting them too, because you can get some
great rewards for collecting them. Here is what I've come up with what you
get for each Temple...


Woodfall Temple Fairies: You'll get an increase of magic power (not your
                         Magic Bar, mind you), which will increase the
                         power of your attacks and magic attacks too.

Snowhead Temple Fairies: You'll get an increase in your Magic Bar, which
                         doubles the amount of Magic Power you can hold
                         throughout the game.

Great Bay Coast Fairies: You'll get double the defensive power as Link, which
                         will make all of your hearts have white outlines, and
                         it will double the amount of damage you can take from
                         enemies.

Stone Tower Temple Fairies: You'll get a Great Fairy's Sword from the Great
                            Fairy, which is just as strong as the Gilded
                            Sword (actually, it doesn't looks remarkably
                            like the Gilded Sword)


===============================================================================
 0008: Great Fairy Fountain Locations
===============================================================================

Woodfall Temple: This Great Fairy Fountain is inside of the cave behind the
                 Owl Statue near the Temple.

Snowhead Temple: This Fountain is at the bottom of the Temple itself, before
                 you have to climb the circular ramp.

Great Bay Temple: On an island with a lone palm tree, use your Hookshot to
                  reach it, then bomb the large rocks blocking the entrance
                  to this Great Fairy Fountain.

Stone Tower Temple: You'll find this Fountain after getting all 15 Stray
                    Fairies in this Temple.


===============================================================================
 0009: Southern Swamp Spider House
===============================================================================

This Spider House is located in the Southern Swamp, to the left of the Deku
Palace, on a small island. Use a Deku Stick to light a torch, and then use
that flaming Deku Stick to burn away the cobwebs blocking the entrance to
this Spider House.

*NOTE: You need the Hookshot to complete this Spider House, and to collect
       every Skulltula token, and you also need at least 2-3 Magic Beans,
       some bugs in a bottle, and a few bottles of spring water!


#1: This Skulltula is directly to your right as you enter the main area,
    just jump off the platform, and break one of the pots to find this
    Skulltula.

#2: This Skulltula is in the water near the end of the first ramp, so
    just kill it to get it.

#3: This Skulltula is also near the ramp, and near Skulltula #2, but it's
    on the pillar near it.

#4: This Skulltula is inside one of the soft-soil patches on the west
    wall near the ramp. Release some bugs near the hole in the wall
    to reveal this Skulltula, then kill it.

#5: Just like Skulltula #4, this one is inside of the soft-soil on the
    east side of the room.

#6: Enter the room to the west of the main room, and hit the Skulltula
    on the wall with your Hookshot, and use the Hookshot to retrieve it.
    If you don't have a Hookshot, then just plant a Magic Bean inside
    of the soft-soil in here (it's underneath the rock, so blow it up
    first with a bomb).

#7: Turn into Goron Link, and crush the large crates to find a
    Skulltula inside. Kill it to get the token. Inside of the same
    room as Skulltula #6.

#8: See Skulltula #7, and check another crate as Goron Link to find
    this Skulltula.

#9: Now go into the eastern room that is to the east of the main
    room. In here, hit the large vase as Goron Link to reveal a
    Skulltula.

#10: See Skulltula #9. This Skulltula is also inside of a different
     vase.

#11: This Skulltula is inside of one of the pots to the right of the
     door. Inside the same room as Skulltula #9-10.

#12: This Skulltula is hiding inside of a small alcove near the sleeping
     Deku Scrub. Slash away the green vines to reveal the alcove
     containing the Skulltula.

#13: Dash back to the western room, and ride up the Magic Bean Leaf
     once more, and ride up to the roof, and shoot one of the bee-hives
     with an arrow to reveal a hiding Skulltula inside.

#14: Head up to the second floor in the room with Skulltula #13, and
     use the Magic Bean Leaf to reach it. Now run around to the other
     side to find a Skulltula behind a torch near the door.

#15: On the second floor, in the center main room, this Skulltula is
     to the left of the Deku Flower, and on the pillar.

#16: This Skulltula is near Skulltula #15, on the wall. Kill it to
     get the token.

#17: Use the Deku Flowers in the center room to reach the other side,
     and enter the door. Shoot the bee-hives up here to find a
     hiding Skulltula.

#18: See Skulltula #17, because this Skulltula is also within one of
     the bee-hives.

#19: In the same room as Skulltula #17, but on the other side of the
     room, so use the Deku Flower to reach the ledge, and kill the
     Skulltula to get it's token.

#20: Head through the next door where Skulltula #17 is, and start
     off by hitting the crystal switch to lower a ladder. Kill
     the Skulltula that is on the pillar near the switch.

#21: Also in the same room as Skulltula #20, this little guy is on
     the far wall. Use your Hookshot to hit it, then use it again
     to reach it and pull it to you. If you do not have the Hookshot,
     then use a Magic Bean Leaf on the soft-soil spot in here.

#22: Use the ladder that has been created, and climb up it, and locate
     the Skulltula here.

#23: In the same room as Skulltula #21, this one is hiding inside of
     a bee-hive on the roof.

#24: This Skulltula is in the same room as Skulltula #21, on the second
     floor, above the doorway that leads to a red door. Use the Magic
     Bean Leaf to reach it, then hop into the ledge, and head into the
     door.

#25: This Skulltula is running around inside of the tall grass surround-
     ing the room, so you might lose some health, but you'll find him.

#26: This Skulltula is in the same area as Skulltula #26, also in the
     tall grass.

#27: This Skulltula is hiding inside of the center tree in the center
     of the room. Turn into Goron Link, and punch the tree with your
     mighty power, and watch this Skulltula, and two others fall down
     to the ground. Kill him to get his token.

#28: See Skulltula #27.

#29: See Skulltula #27, also.

#30: In the same room as Skulltula #27-29, this Skulltula is hiding
     inside one of the bee-hives on the ceiling of the room. Shoot
     it down with an arrow, then kill the Skulltula to get the last
     token in this Spider House.


Now just run back to the entrance of this Spider House, and talk with
the guy with the mask. He'll be so relieved that you saved him and his
house, that he'll give you the Mask of Truth!


===============================================================================
 0010: Oceanside Spider House
===============================================================================

This Spider House is located in Great Bay Coast, to the left of the Fisherman's
Hut on the beach.

       the First Day, you will get the Giant's Wallet, which lets Link
       carry up to 500 Rupees at a time. :)

    Skulltula #1-2. Use a Fire Arrow to burn it, then kill the Skulltula
    to get the coin.

#4: In the second room, the large one. It's inside of the large barrel towards
    the northeast part of the room. Turn into Goron Link, and punch the barrel
    to open it, and capture this Skulltula token.

#5: Also in the same room with Skulltula #4, this one is also inside of a
    large barrel, but the barrel is behind some cobwebs near Skulltula #4.

#6: This Skulltula is inside of the same room with Skulltula #4-5, on the
    west wall. Climb the crate here to see it, then use your Hookshot to
    get it.

#7: This Skulltula is also in the same room as Skulltula tokens #4-6, but
    this little guy is on the ceiling. Use your hookshot to get it down.

#8: This Skulltula token is inside the west room to the west of the room
    containing Skulltula tokens #4-7. This guy is behind the painting to
    the west part of the room, across from the doorway you enter in from.

#9: This Skulltula token is on top of the bookshelf near the entrance to
    the room (it's in the same room as Skulltula #8). Climb the bookshelf
    to reach it.

#10: This Skulltula token is behind the bookshelf in the same room as
     Skulltula #9, and behind the shelf is a hole containing the Skulltula
     token. Use your Hookshot to reach it.

#11: Inside the same room as Skulltula #9-10, search the south-west portion
     of the room to locate a large bookshelf. Move it out of the way to find
     this Skulltula token, along with Skulltula token #12.

#12: See Skulltula token #11.

#13: This Skulltula token is to the south of the room with Skulltula tokens
     #8-12, behind yet another painting. Use your Hookshot to reach it.

#14: This Skulltula token is in the south-east corner of the room with
     the Skulltula tokens #8-13, on the top bookshelf.

#15: In the basement area of the Spider House, this Skulltula token is
     inside the stairway that leads down to the basement.

#16: Also in the first room in the basement, this Skulltula token is hidden
     within a pot on a crate.

#17: Towards the north wall of the room with Skulltula #16, there is a cobweb.
     Burn it away with a Fire Arrow to see the Skulltula. Now just use your
     Hookshot to reach it in the hole.

#18: This Skulltula is inside of the large mask in the same room as Skulltula
     #17, so hit it when it comes out of it.

#19: This Skulltula token is inside a large barrel to the east of the room
     with Skulltula token #18. Use Goron Link to smash it, and kill the
     Skulltula to get it's token.

#20: Now enter the room that is to the northwest of the room with Skulltula
     tokens #16-19, and check out the large crate to the right of the
     door to find the Skulltula token.

#21: Shoot the wooden beam above the canoes in the same room that has
     Skulltula #20, with a Fire Arrow to reveal this Skulltula.

#22: Check out the area behind the canoes here to find another Skulltula
     token.

#23: Check out the southern crate in this room, and smash it with Goron Link,
     then use normal Link to crawl through the hole, and then use your
     Hookshot to reach the Skulltula on the ceiling in this room.

#24: Also in the same room as Skulltula #23, this one is on a rafter near
     Skulltula #22. Head up the crate and hookshot your way by using the
     hookshot target to reach the rafter. Smash the pot containing the
     Skulltula to find it and take it's token.

#25: Now go back to the center basement room, then enter the room to the
     east now. In this next room, check out the large barrel to the
     north of the entrance, and smash the barrel as Goron Link to reveal
     a Skulltula.

#26: Run to the center of the room as Goron Link, and do a Goron Stomp on
     the table here, and three Skulltulas will come falling down from the
     chandelier above the table.

#27: See Skulltula token #26.

#28: See Skulltula token #26.

#29: Find the painting near Skulltula #25, and knock it down with your
     Hookshot to reveal a hiding Skulltula.

#30: This Skulltula is lurking behind some cobwebs on the ceiling to the
     west part of this room, to the left of the door where you entered
     this room from (left if you are walking into the room, but it's
     to your right if you are facing the door).


If you manage to collect all 30 Skulltula tokens from this house, you will
receive the Giant's Wallet!


===============================================================================
 0011: The Reunion
===============================================================================

This long trading sequence will allow you to fill out your Bomber's Notebook
nicely, as well as collect at least 3 different masks along the way! Well,
let's get started, shall we?

• Start off by heading to the Mayor's Residence on Day 1, and entering the
  right-hand door, then speaking to Madame Aroma (Kafei's mother), then
  receiving Kafei's Mask from her, as well as adding her to your notebook.
  Now head to the Stock Pot Inn sometime between 1PM and 4PM on Day 1
  still, and talk to the Inn-keeper to get a room key. Now wait inside
  of the Inn until the Mailman delivers a letter to the Inn-keeper, and
  when he leaves, speak to her with Kafei's Mask on. Now with your Key,
  go into the Inn after 11PM (around 11:30 is more like it), and enter
  the kitchen area on the main floor of the Inn to meet the Inn-keeper.


• After your conversation with her ends, she'll give you a letter to
  deliver for her, so immediately deposit the letter into a mailbox
  before the Mailman gets there, so he can deliver the letter. Now
  on Day 2, go to the Mailman in the Post Office around 3PM, and play
  his Training game to get a Piece of Heart. Now wait until around
  9AM the next day, and the mailman will deliver the letter, and the
  event will be entered into your Notebook. Now head to the Laundry
  Pool after this event occurs, and wait until about 4PM, and the
  back door in the Laundry Pool will become unlocked, so enter it.


• Inside, talk to Kafei, and promise to keep his secret. Eventually, he'll
  give you the Pendant of Memories to deliver to Anju at the Stock Pot
  Inn, so take it to her sometime around 5PM on Day 2. Deliver this
  item, then wait until after 1PM on Day 3, and enter the back door in
  the Laundry Pool, and enter the Curiosity Shop. Talk to the owner here,
  and he'll give you the Keaton Mask! He'll also give you a letter
  that you will need to give to the Mailman in the post office, so
  dash there after 6PM, and give it to the Mailman. After the letter has been
  delivered to Mama, then speak to him to get the Postman's Hat! Now
  be sure you have Garo's Mask, because if you do not, then you cannot
  proceed until you get it. To find how to get it, look in the "Masks"
  section of this FAQ. Once you have it, make your way towards the Ikana
  Canyon, and talk to the old man, and show him your Garo's Mask to
  enter. Now enter the Ikana Canyon...

• Once here in Ikana Canyon (it should be a little past 6PM), and run forward
  to where the two Octoroks are in the water near the bridge, and head right
  of them to find a secret cave entrance. Walk into it to find Sakon the
  thief entering his hideout. At 7PM, he'll run inside, and so will
  Kafei. Follow them, and watch the cutscene. After it ends, you will play
  as Kafei. Immediately push the left-hand block onto the blue switch, then
  as Link, enter the next room and kill the Deku Plant. Now as Kafii, enter
  the next door, and into another room with some switches. Run AROUND the
  red switches (if you step on them, the conveyor belt with the Sun's Mask
  will go faster. To slow the belt down, step on the yellow switches
  instead). Step on the blue switch at the lower corner, then enter the
  next room as Link, kill the Deku Plants, then enter the next room as
  Kafei.

• Your goal here is to push the center block downward and onto the blue switch.
  To do this, first push the first clock below you down, then step on the
  yellow switch and pull the block onto it. Now run around, and push
  the center block down and onto the blue switch. As Link, enter the
  next room and kill the Wolfo. Now enter the next room as Kafei, and
  step on the blue switch. Now as Link, run into the next room and
  step on the blue switch here as well. Kafei will get his Sun's Mask
  back.

• After Kafei runs off, go back (warp with the Song of Soaring) to Clock
  Town, and into the Stock Pot Inn, and enter the room at the top of
  the stairs (across from the stairs). Wait there with Anju until
  the game clock counts down to about 1:33:00 and Kafei will enter,
  and they will reunite, and give you the Couple's Mask!



(Thanks to Wroth for helping me start this trading sequence out!)

 0012: Learning the Scarecrow's Song
===============================================================================

To learn the Scarecrow's Song, simply find the Scarecrow in the Observatory
or inside of the Trading Post in Clock Town, and play a made-up song that
was made up by yourself. Teach him this, then remember the song for later.
Now whenever you find a Scarecrow, play this song to awaken him, and to get
special things like Heart Pieces from them!

19. Bestiary List

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

===============================================================================
Armos
===============================================================================
The Armos are the huge ass statues that stay still until you either attack it
or you just touch it. The only real way to defeat them without taking too
much damage is to NOT hit them to activate them, and just toss a bomb at
them or lay one down in front of it. Run away when it turns red, before it
blows up and damages you.


===============================================================================
Bad Bat
===============================================================================
AKA the Keese. See the Keese strategy in this section for more information
on how to beat this bat.


===============================================================================
Beamos
===============================================================================
The Beamos are the spinning robots with a single eye that, when it spots you,
shoots a powerful laser at you until it hits you, or loses track of you. To
combat this, toss a bomb at it before it sees you, or if it already has
seen you, then just toss a Deku Nut at it to stun it, then bomb it.


===============================================================================
Big Poe
===============================================================================
This can be found Beneath the Well in Ikana Canyon, and to kill it, simply
wait for it to spin at you, block it's attack with your sword, then shoot
an arrow at it when it stops moving, or if you are close enough, to just
attack it with your sword.


===============================================================================
Black Boes
===============================================================================
These are the "shadow" creatures found in dark temples, and in darker areas.
They're hard to see, but are easy to kill. But the one downside of them is
that they like to travel in packs of 5 or more (usually), so this can make
it harder to kill them without taking damage.


===============================================================================
Blue Bubble
===============================================================================
The Blue Bubbles are the skulls with the blue gas surrounding it, and they
are annoying, to say the least. To defeat it, simply hit it with your
shield, then when the gas dissappears, slash at it with your sword. Now
if you let them touch you with their blue gas, you will become jinxed, and
will not be able to sheath your sword temporarily.


===============================================================================
Blue Tektite
===============================================================================
It's a blue spider enemy that doesn't cause much damage, but can become
irritating at times because it hops up and down all over you, and it
can dodge your sword attacks. It's mainly found in the Mountain Village
region of the game.


===============================================================================
Blue Chucu
===============================================================================
These are those blue blobs (this is only one of many different colored
versions), and can be killed with a single strike of your Gilded or Fairy's
Sword. They have different items in their stomachs, but what comes out is
totally random.


===============================================================================
Deku Baba (Tall)
===============================================================================
The tall Deku Babas are incredibly easy to kill, since they just stand there,
and basically let Link kill them. But they do make some noises that could
strike fear into your heart </sarcasm>. Kill them to get Deku Nuts or Deku
Sticks.


===============================================================================
Deku Baba (Short)
===============================================================================
For some reason, the smaller version of the Deku Babas are actually more
dangerous than the bigger versions, since they can attack you. Just wait
for them to attack, then strike when they recoil away from you.


===============================================================================
Dexihands
===============================================================================
Dexihands are those things in the underwater parts of the game that block
your path into some underwater tunnels, and if not killed, will grab you
and toss you around like a rag-doll. It's always best to kill them with
your Fin Boomerangs from afar before trying to swim past them.


===============================================================================
Dinofols
===============================================================================
These guys usually are mini-bosses, and come as armored as they come. You
can't attack them right off the bat, because they'll just block you, so
dodge their fire breath attack, then attack them while they are vulnerable.
Do this a few times to kill them off.


===============================================================================
Dodongo
===============================================================================
These guys, although large, can be killed rather easily if you have the Gilded
Sword or Fairy's Sword. Just dodge their fire-breath, then circle around them
and slash at their tail, the immediately block, because they will spin around
and hit you with their tail. You can also bomb their tails if you wish, but
this is harder to do.


===============================================================================
Dragonfly
===============================================================================
The Dragonflys are mostly around the areas where you must play as Deku Link
(the Stone Tower Temple courtyard is one exception to this), and will
hover around until provoked, or when it sees you. Kill it from afar, or
use the Deku Flowers to launch into them, and to kill them easily.


===============================================================================
Eeno
===============================================================================
These can only be found in one room in the Snowhead Temple, and will chuck
snowballs at you from afar. To kill them, just shoot a few arrows into them,
and they should die off quickly.


===============================================================================
Eyegore
===============================================================================
This cycloptic enemy is pretty easy to beat. Just get close enough for him
to attack, then dodge his attack, and when his eye turns yellow, hit it
with your Hookshot or arrows. Repeat this until he dies. Or, you can just
strike his eye with your sword, but this doesn't usually work all that
well.


===============================================================================
Fire Keese
===============================================================================
Just like regular keese (bats), these Keese are just on fire, and when they
touch Link, will catch Link on fire as well. Shoot them from afar with
some arrows, or slash at them with your sword as they get near you.


===============================================================================
Floormaster
===============================================================================
I hate these guys, but they're not as bad as the Wallmasters. The Floormasters
are usually only found in the Stone Tower Temple, and to defeat them, either
shine light onto them with your Mirror Shield, or just slash at them with
your sword, then kill the 3 mini-Floormasters that emerge.


===============================================================================
Freezard
===============================================================================
These guys don't really move at all, but can do some harm if you get in the
way of their freeze-breath. To kill them, simply shoot them from afar with
a Fire Arrow to melt them away.


===============================================================================
Garos
===============================================================================
These un-dead ninjas only come out in Ikana Canyon while Link is wearing the
Garo Mask. They'll surround you with fire, so just wait until it dies down,
then attack them. If they attack you first, block their attack, then slash
at them when they are vulnerable.


===============================================================================
Gekko
===============================================================================
This is a mini-boss type of character, and can be killed by slashing at him
with arrows to stun him, then attack with your sword to do some damage to
Gekko. Repeat this process to defeat most forms of Gekko.


===============================================================================
Green Chucu
===============================================================================
Just like the Blue Chucu, only this time, this guy is Green. Kill it the same
way as you do the other Chucus. By the way, they are great as platforms when
you shoot an Ice Arrow at them to freeze them...


===============================================================================
Gold Skulltulla
===============================================================================
Not really an enemy, but they can cause damage to Link. They are found inside
of the 2 Spider Houses, 30 in each. They don't really move much, so just hit
them with an arrow or your sword to kill 'em fast.


===============================================================================
Hiploop
===============================================================================
This is a rather easy to beat enemy, and can be found near and inside of the
Woodfall Temple, and in the Stone Tower Temple, but those ones have steel
masks on. To kill them, just shoot it with a bubble from Deku Link, or an
arrow or sword slash from normal Link before they charge at you.


===============================================================================
Ice Keese
===============================================================================
Yet another variation of the normal Keese (bats), this type of Keese is
blue, surrounded by Ice, and when it touches Link, it will freeze Link
momentarily, and will do damage to him.


===============================================================================
Iron Knuckle
===============================================================================
To defeat this monstrosity, simply strike before he strikes you. Hit him once
to start the fight, then hit him a few more times before he swings his axe
at you, dodge those attacks, then hit him some more. Wait for him to get his
axe stuck in the ground, then hit him a lot for some serious damage, until
his firstlayer of armor comes off. Now continue this strategy to kill him for
good.


===============================================================================
Keese
===============================================================================
The original type of Keese, these guys are just like bats, in that they fly
around the room until they see you, then they'll dive-bomb you. Kill them
from afar with a well-placed arrow to keep the danger factor out of the
fight.


===============================================================================
Leever
===============================================================================
These guys are sorta like the Chucu's, but they come out of the sandy beaches
in Great Bay Coast, and will spin at you until they hit you (or something
else). Dodge their attacks, then slash at them before they can come back
at you.


===============================================================================
Like Like
===============================================================================
Like-Likes return from the last Zelda game, and are still annoying, but aren't
as big of a hassle as the ones in the last game. They are mostly found in
the Great Bay area, both on the surface and underwater. Avoid doing close-
combat with them, because if sucked up, they can steal items from you, and
even weapons or armor! It's best to just avoid them or kill them from far
away with an arrow or two.


===============================================================================
Mad Scrub
===============================================================================
A variation of the Deku Scrub, the Mad Scrub shoots at you from afar from his
redish Deku Flower. Kill them from afar too, with some arrows or bubbles
from Deku Link.


===============================================================================
Mini Baba
===============================================================================
Once again, here is a newer variation of the Deku Baba, these guys do almost
no damage, because they are buried beneath the ground. Slash at them without
getting too close to kill them without taking damage.


===============================================================================
Nejiron
===============================================================================
These guys come out of the ground near Ikana Canyon, and replace where the
Blue Bubbles once were (sometimes). They sorta look like Gorons, because
they roll around, but they make odd noises, and will blow up if you slash
at them with your sword. It's best to either shoot them from afar with either
an arrow or your Hookshot, or bomb it. When it dies, it usually gives up
some bombs. They come out of the ground in packs, and roll right at you,
which doesn't leave much time for defense. Be aware of these guys...


===============================================================================
Octorok
===============================================================================
These are back from the last Zelda game, and lurk underwater, and on the
water's surface. They are pretty big, and will shoot rocks at you from
afar. Shoot them with arrows to avoid them, or block their rocks back at
them with your shield. Also, they can become great ice-bergs if shot with
an Ice Arrow...


===============================================================================
Poe
===============================================================================
A smaller version of the Big Poe, this one is a little bit easier to beat,
but it takes longer. Just wait for them to stop spinning and reappear, then
attack it when it materializes near you. They are only found in the Stone
Tower Temple.


===============================================================================
Real Bombchu
===============================================================================
These guys look like little rabid animals with bombs for tails. They'll commit
suicide to damage you, and when they get close, watch out for their bombs.
Just block them with your shield to cause them to explode, and kill them
without taking any damage.


===============================================================================
Red Chucu
===============================================================================
Another variation of the Chucu, you should kill them the same way as you do
with the other variations of Chucus, and beware that these guys are scattered
everywhere in the Termina World, and will give out anything from a heart
to a Rupee to some arrows. Once again, what comes out of their stomach is
completely random.


===============================================================================
ReDead
===============================================================================
These walking mummies are scattered in Ikana Canyon, and Beneath the Well.
If they see you, they'll hop onto your back, and suck your health until
they are done. Their icy-stare will freeze you, so try not to get very close
to them at all. If you wear the Gibdo or Garo's Mask, you can walk past the
ReDeads without them even noticing you.


===============================================================================
Skulltulla
===============================================================================
The papa-version of the Gold Skulltulas, these ones are a lot larger than
them, and do more damage too. When they drop down in front of you, simply
wait for them to turn around to reveal their bellies, then strike when you
see it. That, or you can simply shoot an arrow at them to kill them faster.


===============================================================================
Snapper
===============================================================================
Snappers are almost EXACTLY like the Skulltulas, but if you get too close,
they'll spin around, and damage you seriously. Shoot them with an arrow
from afar to ensure an easy fight, but you can always attempt to kill them
with your sword...


===============================================================================
Stalchild
===============================================================================
This is a mini-skeleton, and is a soldier of the great Captain Keeta. They
don't harm you much, and can be killed easily with your sword. But if you
wear the Captain's Hat, you can actually talk to them, and give them orders!
After they have taken your orders, they'll collapse into a pile of bones.


===============================================================================
Stalfols
===============================================================================
Returning from Ocarina of Time, the Stalfos are some armored skeletons, and
attack almost like the Wolfos, and should be treated the same, too. Just
wait for them to attack, block it, then slash at them when they are vulnerable.


===============================================================================
Takkuri
===============================================================================
I hate these guys. They look like giant birds in Termina Field, but they are
different, in that they'll dive bomb you, and steal items from you, including
your sword! I strongly suggest that you just avoid them, but if you can kill
them, you will get a Gold Rupee worth 200 Rupees!


===============================================================================
White Boes
===============================================================================
Just like the Black Boes, these are the "lighter" version of the shadow
creatures found in most dungeons, and in darker and lighter areas of the
game. They come in packs of 5-6 Boes, so they can be tough to defeat, but
once you get rid of most of the pack, it gets way easier to defeat them
all.


===============================================================================
Wolfos
===============================================================================
These armored wolves come in two flavors: Normal and Ice Wolfos. If you try
to attack them normally, they'll just block you, so wait for them to attack
and either dodge or block them, then when they turn their backs to you,
slash at them with your sword. Do this a few times to defeat them.

20. Secrets and Easter Eggs

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

===============================================================================
 00001: Unlimited Rupees
===============================================================================

This  secret  basically  gives  you unlimited Rupees, or as much as you
want.  To  do  this,  head  into the Bomber's Hideout, and run down the
ramp. Now instead of heading into the water and straight to head to the
Observatory,  swim  to  the  left  down  the  corridor  to  a seemingly
dead-end.  Avoid  the Skulltula, and to the left at the end is a ledge.
Climb  up it, and you will see a bombable wall with a crack in it. Take
out a bomb, and bomb the wall open to reveal a chest. Inside this chest
is the legendary Silver Rupee, worth a whopping 100 Rupees! How is this
unlimited  you ask? Simple. Just take your new 100 Rupees to the banker
in  West Clock Town, then go back to the First Day, locate the bombable
wall,  and  take  yet  another Silver Rupee. Now just keep on repeating
this, and eventually, you will get as many Rupees as you want!


Other Silver Rupee locations:

• This Silver Rupee can be found in the Stock Pot Inn on the First Day. To
  get it, simply enter the Inn sometime in the afternoon after 2PM, and
  check yourself in. Take the room key, and enter your room. Inside you
  will find another Silver Rupee.

• This Silver Rupee is located on the roof of the Town Shooting Gallery,
  inside of a small chest. To get to it, first use Zora Link to get
  to the Milk Bar roof, then hop from this roof to the next ledge
  that leads to the Town Shooting Gallery roof, then return to normal
  Link, and make your way across the signs, and onto the roof where
  you will find this chest containing the Silver Rupee.


===============================================================================
 00002: Rocket Gossip Stones
===============================================================================

For this cool, little Easter Egg, just locate any Gossip Stone in Termina. Now
once you have found one, place a bomb in front of it, and back away before it
blows up. When it blows up in front of the Gossip Stone, the Gossip Stone
will go into a countdown mode, and then rocket off into the air, and into
space. Pretty cool, eh?


===============================================================================

===============================================================================
 00005: Gossip Stone Responses (Hints)
===============================================================================

By popular request (yes, I've actually had people request these, just out
of sheer curiosity and laziness...), here are some of the responses (basically
hints and tips) that you get from the Gossip Stones scattered around Termina
when you check them while wearing the Mask of Truth. Try to speak to the
Gossip Stones while wearing any other mask only results in Tatl saying:

 "It's like my heart is being peered right into. That's a disturbing eye!"

Blah.


 "The Mystical Stone responds to the mask and speaks to you."
 "...But it's words are heard in secret..."


 "It seems the face of the slightly larger, strange stone changes when the
 guitar of waves is played..."

 "It seems the face of the slightly larger, strange stone changes when the
 pipes of awakening is played..."

 "It seems all the strange stones that are arranged in a row wish to be
 the same color."

 "It seems the face of the slightly larger, strange stone changes when the
 drums of sleep are played..."

 "The symbol of marriage, the Couple's Mask seems to have the power to
 calm and silence arguments."

 "Anju, the woman at the inn, is known to be careless and frequently mixes
 up guests..."

 "It seems the hideout of Sakon, the thief, is tucked away at the edge of
 Ikana Canyon..."

 "It seems the crows that fly near the town walls are fond of musical
 instruments..."

 "The Postman puts his delivery schedule before everything else, but
 priority mail is of even greater importance."

 "It seems the veranda door of the town's Stock Pot Inn has carelessly
 been left unlocked..."

 "The Swamp Tourist Center will not accept photographs taken outside
 the swamp. But if you bring a photograph of the guide's son, he'll
 give you something nice..."

 "The mask that can see into people's hearts and minds also seems to
 work well on animals as well..."

 "The Gold Dust won as a prize in the Goron Races in spring can be
 used by the smithy to forge a sword. Or it can be sold to the smithy
 for 40 Rupees, but the Curiosity Shop will buy it for 200 Rupees..."

 "A small, lost horse seems to have been taken in by Romani Ranch,
 south of town..."

 "The frogs that are supposed to gather in the mountains where spring
 arrives elsewhere. You need Don Gero's Mask to bring them together.
 The frogs in Clock Town, the swamp, Woodfall Temple and Great Bay
 Temple make four..."

 "The spirit of the charasmitic dancer who died in Termina Field dances
 there night after night."
