              pieces; minor corrections made. Created Requested Strategies area.

17 Nov 2000:  Readers have been writing in and offering advice, and even a tip
              or two on how to get the tougher heart pieces....thanks!

09 Nov 2000:  After beating Majora's Mask and gaining all twenty of the heart
	      pieces, I decided to write an FAQ guide for it, because in some
              areas, it is quite difficult.

--- WHAT ARE PIECES OF HEART ---
 ------------------------------
In order to boost your Life Energy (the heart meter on your screen), you will 
need to find numerous "pieces" of a Heart Container.  Most of these can be
found very early in the game, but others require key items that you do not have
access to until later.  Heart Containers are found as a whole after you defeat
a Temple Guardian.  There are four of these in the game.  Since you start out
with Three Hearts, you will have only SEVEN if you do not attempt to locate
these heart pieces.

Pieces of Heart that you recover account for one-quarter of the whole heart. 
To see how many pieces you have at any time, press [START] and locate the 
QUEST STATUS SCREEN.

There are a total of Fifty-Two Heart Pieces in Zelda: Majora's Mask, as opposed
to the Thirty-Two found in Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  The Pieces of Heart will 
give you a maximum of 13 Hearts.

Some things you need to know about Majora's Mask is that everything revolves 
around 'time'.  Although you can alter it and go back, you don't keep some of 
the items you had during trade sequences.  At the bottom in MY STRATEGIES, I
explain some of the sequences. 

A 'key' I commonly use is the "Cleared Dungeon x".  In order to obtain this
piece of heart, you will have to defeat the boss again so the games/items 
are "activated".

--- HEART PIECE LOCATIONS ---

*The Heart Piece Guide Below Follows This Format*
(AREA)
(Number).(Link);(Items You Need)-(Guide).

 - CLOCK TOWN -
   ----------
1. Link; Bunny Hood-In NORTH CLOCK TOWN, there are some pillars and a ramp.  You

   here, jump off towards the Tree Branch and get your piece of heart!

2. Deku Link; Moon's Tear-In SOUTH CLOCK TOWN, give the Deku Business Scrub
   (located by the Golden Deku Launcher) the Moon's Tear in exchange for the

3. Link; 10 Rupees Per Game-In WEST CLOCK TOWN, go to the Swordsman's School. 
   Talk to him to play his Log-Cutting game.  It's 10 rupees per chance, so bring
   extra in case you mess up.  To win, keep using the "Z-Targeting Overhead
   Slash [A Button]" technique. If you score a perfect 30, you get the heart
   piece.

4. Link-In WEST CLOCK TOWN, if you go to the banker and repeatdly deposit rupees,
   you will receive a Heart Piece when your total reaches 5,000. [SEE THE MY

   Day 2.  Wait until the Postman finishes his evening run, then go inside.  He

   the center bush.  You will summon Keaton!  Answer five questions correctly

   the one from before).  At midnight, go to the Stock Pot Inn [EAST CLOCK TOWN]
   and run around to the Upper Floor.  Go in the small room and a Hand will
   start spazzing out around you.  Give him the Land Title Deed and he'll give

**WHAT? IS THAT THE ZELDA OVERWORLD THEME!?!? :)

17. Link; 100 Rupees-From EAST CLOCK TOWN, go to the Astral Observatory.  Use
    the Telescope to watch for a Deku Business Scrub fly into a Hole.  Leave 
    the South or East Gate of Clock Town and run to the Hole.  Refuse his first
    offer of 150 Rupees and he'll lower his offer down to 100.  Buy the piece.

18. Link-In the northern area of TERMINA FIELD, there's a hole under one of
    the snow mushrooms. Hop in and do battle with two Dodongos. Kill them both
    Dodongos to get a heart piece.

19. Goron Link; Goron's Lullaby-In Four Areas in TERMINA FIELD, there are holes
    that lead to four Gossip tones, one being larger than the rest.  They are
    located:  1) Under a Rock between NORTH and WEST TERMINA FIELD; 2) Near the
    edge of the Tall Grass out between the Swamp and Milk Road; 3) Outside 
    NORTH CLOCK TOWN near the spot where snow and grass meet; 4) Near the 
    outside of the Astral Observatory. Play the Goron's Lullaby to each of the
    4 stones to gain a Heart Piece.

20. Link-Head to TERMINA FIELD out of SOUTH CLOCK TOWN, and start walking to 
    MILK ROAD. As you walk through the high grass, go near the Deku Baba that 
    pops up at you and you will fall into an underground cave with a peahat 
    inside. Kill it to get the heart piece.  

21. Link; Zora Mask, Arrows, Bombs-Near the entrance to the Great Bay Coast is
    a large rock. Hit it with a Bomb or punch it as a Goron and drop down into 
    the hole. Shoot down one of the beehives on the ceiling with your bow, and
    the heart piece will fall into the water.  From the surface, plink the 
    enemies with the Hero's Bow, then sink down as Zora Link and get it.

 - SOUTHERN SWAMP -
   --------------

22. Link-Climb on the big tree's vines to find a Heart Piece at the top.  Shoot
    or slice the Keese [Bats] that fly at you first.

23. Deku Link; Land Title Deed-Take the MOON'S TEAR you got near the Astral
    Observatory and bring it to the Deku Merchant in town.  Take the LAND TITLE
    DEED he will give you.  Go to the SOUTHERN SWAMP, and look on the ledge with
    the hut.  Give him the LAND TITLE DEED, and he will give you the SWAMP TITLE
    DEED. Use the Deku Launcher to fling yourself up to the roof of the hut
    where you'll find the heart piece.

24. Link; Cleared Dungeon 1, Rupees-After you beat Odolwa, go back to the photo hut and

    archery. Shoot at least 20 of the targets before the boat ride is over to gain

    first time is free, after that she will charge you.

    Heart Piece.


 - MOUNTAIN VILLAGE -
   ----------------

29. Zora Link; Cleared Dungeon 2-After you get the Zora's Mask, clear out Dungeon 2

    and sink down using the Zora's Mask.  On the bottom is a chest with a Heart Piece.

30. Link; Don Gero Mask, Cleared Dungeon 2 & 3-When you get the Don Gero Mask, Link
    gains the ability to talk to frogs.  They are found in the following areas: 
    1) CLOCK TOWN: Hopping near the tree in the LAUNDRY POOL.
    2) WOODFALL TEMPLE: After beating Gekko, he will turn into a frog.
    3) SOUTHERN SWAMP: This frog is on a log near the Octoroks.
    4) GREAT BAY TEMPLE: Beat Gekko again to turn him into a frog.

    hookshot to get to the heart piece.

32. Deku Link; Swamp Title Deed-Talk to the Deku Business Scrub near the Goron Shrine,
    and trade the Swamp Title Deed for the MOUNTAIN TITLE DEED.  Jump in his flower
    and blast up to the ledge.

 - GREAT BAY -
   ---------

33. Link; Zora's Mask, Hookshot-Go to the right area of Great Bay (where you accessed 
    Zora Hall) and fire your hookshot on the palm trees atop each platform. Go up to 
    the top and through the opening.  Throw on the Zora Mask and dive into the
    water. Sink down, talk to the beaver, and he will race you through 20 rings. If 
    you go through them all before the time is up, you can race his brother through 
    25 rings and get a bottle if you make it. Race them both again and win to get the
    heart piece.

34. Zora Link-Go to the right area of Great Bay, (where you accessed Zora Hall) and
    dive down where the waterfall is. Kill the skeleton fish followed by the Like-Like
    to get the heart piece.

35. Link; Captain's Hat, Hero's Bow, Hookshot-In the OCEANSIDE SPIDER HOUSE,
    go into the room with the Skeletons.  Put on the Captain's Hat and talk to them to
    find out the order to shoot the faces.  Go through the grate that opens and get
    the chest with a Piece of Heart inside.

36. Link; Pictograph Box, Zora Mask, Stone Mask-Take a closeup picture of a pirate
    for the seahorse with the fisherman. Put the seahorse into a bottle and release it
    near Pinnacle Rock. Kill all the sea snakes and rescue the trapped seahorse to get
    a Heart Piece.

37. Link; Bottle(s), Fish-Catch a few fish in bottles and feed the two fish in the
    MARINE RESEARCH LAB.  One of the fish will eventually get huge and eat the other
    fish. A Heart Piece will be the result.

38. Link; Hookshot, 20 Rupees/Game, Cleared Dungeon 3-After Gyorg is dead, ride the
    boat that is docked north of the Research Lab (head towards Pirate's Fortress) 
    out to an island, and use the hookshot to get on the island.  (The Boat will drive
    by it, so you'll have to hook it on the fly.) Beat the fisherman's jumping game to
    get a piece of heart.

39. Link; Hookshot, Bottle of Water, Magic Bean, Scarecrow's Song-On the shore near
    the Pirate's Fortress is a Hookshot Target.  Fire up, keep going, you'll find some
    softsoil. Plant a seed and water it. Use the plant to ride up and at the top play 
    the Scarecrow's Song and hookshot over to the heart piece.


 - ZORA HALL -
   ---------

40. Link; Zora Mask, Hookshot-In ZORA HALL, go into your dressing room. Hookshot up 
    to the top ledge and read the journal as Zora Link to learn the two parts of a
    song. Go into the guitarist's room and play the first part after
    he plays his part, and the second part after he plays his second part.  Then, go
    to the pianist's room and play the whole song (both 1 and 2 together) to him as 
    normal Link to get the heart piece.

41. Deku Link; Goron Mask, Mountain Title Deed-As Goron Link, offer the MOUNTAIN
    TITLE DEED to the Deku Scrub in Lulu's dressing room. Use the Deku Launcher to 
    get to a heart piece.  He'll give you the OCEAN TITLE DEED in return, too.


 - PIRATE'S FORTRESS -
   -----------------

42. Goron Link; Bunny Hood-As you make your way through the Fortress, bash the
    barrels in the room where you see a Heart Piece in a cage.  Step on the switch
    as Goron Link, and then switch into Normal Link with Bunny Hood and run to it.


 - IKANA CANYON -
   ------------
43. Deku Link; Ocean Title Deed, Hookshot, Garo's Mask-Access the canyon by talking
    to the Ghost Man on the wall with Garo's Mask on.  Hookshot up and over, then
    head to the right.  Run as far as you can go, and throw on the Zora Mask.  Give
    the OCEAN TITLE DEED to the Deku Scrub. Use the Deku Flower to get to the 
    nearby heart piece.

44. Link; Hero's Bow, Rupees-Take the GHOST COLLECTOR'S CHALLENGE in IKANA CANYON.
    His shop is near the Music Box House.  You'll have to kill four Poes before
    time runs out, bring some cash.


 - IKANA GRAVEYARD - 
   ---------------
45. Link; Captain's Hat, Bomb, Lens of Truth-In the graveyard at night on Day 2, 
    wear the Captain's Hat and command the Stalchildren to open up the graves so 
    that you can enter a underground lair. Use the Lens of Truth to get through the
    area and bomb to break through the wall. Kill the Ironknuckle to get a piece of
    heart.


 - IKANA RUINS -
   -----------
46. Deku Link-At the top of the ruins when you go outside, there is a crystal
    switch. Hit the switch with a bubble to turn off the fire around the Deku
    Launchers.  Jump from one to another to get the heart piece.

47. Link; Light Arrows-To the left side of IKANA CANYON lies a door with a sun
    switch above it.  Pop it with a Light Arrow.  Enter the shrine and beat
    all the enemies in the four rooms.  After you have killed them all
    return to the center room for a heart piece.  NOTE: The dungeon may not
    let you access some of the rooms if you don't have a lot of hearts, but if
    you complete the ones prior to this, you should be alright.


 - ROMANI RANCH -
   ------------
48. Link; 300 Rupees (To Be Safe)-Bet on the Doggy Racetrack.  Use the Mask of
    Truth to talk to the dogs.  Pick the one that says "Ruff! There's no way 
    I can lose!" Or something like that.  There's no guarantee since every 
    race is random, but you will finish in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd sooner or later, 
    which triples your winnings.  Bet at least 50 rupees on the Race to win
    the piece of heart.

 - THE MOON -  
   --------

NOTE: If you already have the Fierce Deity Mask, there is no need to complete
      these dungeons, just exit the dungeon after you get it.  If you need it
      make sure you get the Heart Piece before you exit, it saves a LOT of 
      trouble.

49. Deku Link-In the ODWALA DUNGEON, Fly up and onto the moving platform.
    Make your way to the GOLD Deku Launcher, and propel yourself to the
    back-right side of the room.  

50. Goron Link-In the GOHT DUNGEON, WHOA! THIS IS BY FAR THE TOUGHEST HEART 
    PIECE! Goron Roll straight ahead and keep going.  You'll sproing off 
    Treasure Chests.  When you go through the two magic pots GET READY, sharply
    turn to the right when it angles, then turn left a bit shallower and hop
    the gap.  Once you hit the three magic pots, STOP ROLLING! See that 
    straightaway? Walk over, line yourself up.  Center yourself.  Goron Roll up
    and over the pit, sproing off the chest, and just stay centered.  You'll 
    eventually make it to the Heart Piece.

51. Zora Link-In the GYORG DUNGEON, sink down; Go left, right, left, then left
    again.

52. Link; Bombchus-In the TWINMOLD DUNGEON, defeat all the bosses.  Eventually
    you'll come to a room with Bombchu's and a hole in the wall.  Blow up the
    hole, hit the switch with a Fire Arrow, and go in.  There's a Heart Piece
    waiting for you.

--- MY STRATEGIES ---
 -------------------
I have many strategies I used to get the Heart Pieces.  Most of them, like for
#50 for example, was just praying! :) The main thing to remember is NEVER give
up.  Sure, you will get aggrivated, pissed, annoyed... It's just a game.  
Don't forget that, just laugh it off.  I spent two hours getting the Goron 
Heart Piece in the Dungeon. (#50).  I spent an hour getting the Deku Scrub
Playground Heart Piece. (#16).  It's annoying, but it's a challenge.  That's
why we play these games, for a challenge.

Here's some strategies to use if you get stuck.  If you need additional help,
and there's no hint here, E-Mail your request to the author of this FAQ,
[templarnocturne@yahoo.com] and I will add the question the next update, along
with a new In-Depth FAQ for it to clarify.

 - CLOCK TOWN -
   ----------

4. Link-In WEST CLOCK TOWN, if you go to the banker and repeatdly deposit rupees,
   you will receive a Heart Piece when your total reaches 5,000.
A. Ok. You know that Bird that flies around Milk road? You can shoot him with 
   arrows from a distance to bring him down.  He'll leave a GOLD RUPEE, worth
   200 Rupees! You can slash up the bushes to replenish your ammunition.  Use
   Z-Targeting to be sure that you hit him, and if you have Fire or Ice Arrows,
   use them.  It takes 12 Arrows to bring him down, but just 6 Elemental Arrows.
   Walk into Milk Road, rinse, and repeat.  This technique works well if you
   have the GIANT'S WALLET.

8. Link; Land Title Deed-Remember the Moon's Tear Heart Piece where you traded
   for the Land Title Deed?  Go back and get the Deed again (if you don't have
   the one from before).  At midnight, go to the Stock Pot Inn [EAST CLOCK TOWN]
   and run around to the Upper Floor.  Go in the small room and a Hand will
   start spazzing out around you.  Give him the Land Title Deed and he'll give 
   you a piece of heart.  (You can go back in time if you need the Land Title Deed
   again.)
A. Please refer to my TITLE DEED TRADE SEQUENCE FAQ, found on GameFAQs.com

13. Link; 20 Rupees Per Game-In EAST CLOCK TOWN, go to the Shooting Gallery 
    during business hours (6 AM - 10 PM).  Score a Perfect 50 to win a 
    Heart Piece.
A.  This is very, very hard. You'll have to try, try again.  If you miss, keep
    going, but beat the OLD RECORD by just one.  This will win you 50 Rupees 
    each time, thereby generating lots of cash for you.  Try to play a lot
    of times, this way you'll get used to where and when the Red Octoroks pop
    up.  With this knowledge, try to get them all in one pass, rather than
    randomly shooting whichever ones you can.  In other words, start at one
    side and make your way to the other. 

14. Link; Bomb Bag, Hero's Bow, 20 Rupees Per Game-In EAST CLOCK TOWN, go to
    Honey & Darling's Shop on Day 1.  Win the high score three days in a row 
    and they will give you a heart piece. Day 1: Bombchu Targeting. Day 2: 
    Bomb-sket Ball.  Day 3: Target Practice (Bow and Arrow). 
A.  This was crazy, but it follows the same thing as #13.  Play often to get
    used to the way the game goes.  The hardest thing to do is shoot straight
    because of the rotating platform.  As you play, you'll get better.  For 
    day 1, Stand straight and keep a mental count (1...2...3...).  If you 
    hit one, keep that mental count, and remember WHEN you launched.  Keep
    your rhythm and you'll get it, just bring lots of cash.

27. Deku Link-In the DEKU PALACE, take your first left after passing the guards.  Make
    your way through the maze, avoiding the guards.  There's a Heart Piece at the end.
A.  You can go back around to where you planted the Magic Bean (remember when you 
    found the monkey?).  Fly around again, but before the final jump, hop down when
    the coast is clear and run right for the heart.

--- READERS' TIPS & STRATEGIES ---
 --------------------------------
Remember, I don't necessarily check to make sure that these are right, but I do
get in the Zelda mood every so often and try them out.  Although I post them, I may
not have checked them over just yet.  (Just my little disclaimer.)

23 Nov 2000: Wow. Thanks to N64master (N64master12488@aol.com), he found quite a
             few get-arounds for the heart pieces!

17 Nov 2000: Thanks to Paul Dinges (pauldinges@earthlink.net), he found a quick
             and easy way to get that elusive Postman Heart Piece!

5. Link; 2 Rupees Per Game-In WEST CLOCK TOWN, go to the Postoffice on Day 1 or
   Day 2.  Wait until the Postman finishes his evening run, then go inside.  He
   will tell you to mentally project 10 seconds to win.  It's 2 Rupees per game
   and I would bring at least 100.  Get 10'00" and win a Heart Piece.
   
*  Paul Dinges:  If you wear the Bunny Hood, the clock will continue counting
   upward from 0 to 10, and won't vanish.  It's much easier to get the Heart
   Piece this way.

8. Link; Land Title Deed-Remember the Moon's Tear Heart Piece where you traded
   for the Land Title Deed?  Go back and get the Deed again (if you don't have
   the one from before).  At midnight, go to the Stock Pot Inn [EAST CLOCK TOWN]
   and run around to the Upper Floor.  Go in the small room and a Hand will
   start spazzing out around you.  Give him the Land Title Deed and he'll give 
   you a piece of heart.  (You can go back in time if you need the Land Title Deed
   again.)

* N64 Master: You can just hand each Scrub the letter from Anju as well.

19. Goron Link; Goron's Lullaby-In Four Areas in TERMINA FIELD, there are holes
    that lead to four Gossip tones, one being larger than the rest.  They are
    located:  1) Under a Rock between NORTH and WEST TERMINA FIELD; 2) Near the
    edge of the Tall Grass out between the Swamp and Milk Road; 3) Outside 
    NORTH CLOCK TOWN near the spot where snow and grass meet; 4) Near the 
    outside of the Astral Observatory. Play the Goron's Lullaby to each of the
    4 stones to gain a Heart Piece.

* N64 Master: You can also play the Sonata of Awakening to the four gossip
              stones, this also works for a heart piece.

25. Deku Link; Pictograph Box-In the DEKU PALACE, take a picture of the Deku King
    in the Deku Palace, and bring it back to the owner of the Photo Hut. He will reward
    you with the heart piece.

* N64 Master: You can also get a picture of Tingle for a heart piece.

Thanks again, and write in with your tips to get Heart Pieces!
