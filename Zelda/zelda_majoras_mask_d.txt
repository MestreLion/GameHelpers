===============================================================================
Chapter I: Story Explanation
===============================================================================

Well, the game starts out with an explanation of how Link began his new quest,
in search of an old friend which he parted with after leaving the land that
made him a legend. SO he is riding through the forest, and 2 fairies which were
with Skull Kid swoop down and cause Epona to buck him off and makes him
unconscious for a while. Now Skull Kid searches him and happened to find the
Ocarina, so when Links notices Skull kid jumps on Epona and tries to escape.
So, Link hangs on for dear life but is eventually knocked off, and is left in
pursuit of Skull Kid who has his Ocarina and Epona...


===============================================================================
Chapter II: Basic Controls/Maneuvering Link
===============================================================================

Magic Energy: This is how much magic power you have. Whenever this gage is
empty, you will no longer be able to use magic. Things like magic spin attacks
and magic arrows all take a certain amount away from this meter.

Rupees: These are how many rupees you have collected. A rupee is the form of
money in the Zelda game series. There are rupees worth 1, 5, 20 and a couple
other different kinds of lager, rarer ones.

Health Meter: This is how much life energy you currently have. This can be
expanded by collecting Heart containers, or simply refilled by drinking a
potion or collecting heart pieces. When this meter runs out of little hearts,
you are officially dead. Note, it will blink when you get really low.

Clock Time: This is how many days and hours you have left to complete the task
at hand. It will show up and warn you after the end of each day, so hurry up!

Map of Area: This is nice, because I would be lost without it. This is just a
map of the area that you are in, you should remember from the last game. Now
you can also buy maps, but that is usually not needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2: Basic Controls & Maneuvering Link
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

C Buttons: Use the three C Buttons, excluding Up C, to use the items that you
           Have set for them. An item can be set by going to the equipment
           Screen and then highlighting it ,then press the C Button you wish
           For it to be set on, then un-pause the game and it Is there.

Up C: This button can be used to change your viewing point or perspective, and
      If you hold it down, you can use it to look all the way around you.

A Button: The A button is the action icon button as it was in the last game. It
          Is used to open doors, push and pull things, and other various
          actions Throughout the game. The action will flash on the game screen
          for you.

B Button: The B button is also known as the attack button. Depending on which
          of The characters it is that you are playing as, Link will do that
          type Of attack, or draw his sword with a swing/slash motion.

Analog Stick: This is your main movement feature. It is used to navigate
              through All of the different menus, as well as control the
              movement of Link, such as the direction he rides, flies or
              runs/walks.

R Button: The R button has the same feature it did in the last game, the
          shield. By simply pressing this button you can draw your shield,
          although he Does not lock onto the enemy like if you used the Z
          targeting buttom.

Z Button: The Z is one of the most important parts of the game. It is used to
          Lock onto enemies and certain parts of enemies which are there only
          Weak points, that would be incredibly hard to lock onto manually. It
          Can be used to lock onto other things, such as distanced speakers.

L Button: This button simply brings out or hides your map of the current area
          That you are in, which is also viewable in the paused game menu.

Start Button: Naturally this is used to pause the game. Pausing can be done at
              Any time, except during cut scenes, it can also be used to skip
              Through the opening introduction, or un-pause the game screen.

Diving: When you are in water deep enough that Link is forced to swim, not
stand, by pressing the A button you can make him dive. You have to hold the A
button to make him stay down, and he only has so much air anyway.

Vertical Sword Swing: Z + B will cause Link to use a larger and more powerful
swinging attack with his sword, where he chops down, rather than coming across
the enemy from the side, it may be a little harder to hit stuff, but stronger.

Horizontal Sword Swing: By pressing the B button, you will cause Link to do the
normal attack. He simply swings his sword outward away from him.

Spin Attack: Complete turn with the joystick + B will cause Link to do a spin
attack. He will cock back the blade behind him and then let it all out in one
massive spin attack. Just he could in the first game, he can add magic to this.

Stab Attack: Z + Up + B makes link do a stabbing attack. He will hold the blade
out in front of him, and then jump and thrust it straight out at whatever you
are trying to attack. This is not all that effective in all cases.

Jump Attack: Z + A and Link will do a jumping attack much like the vertical
attack, except he will have jumped at the enemy, and this does more damage.

Back Flip: Z + Back + A makes Link do a back flip, which can actually be used
to an advantage if you learn how. It can be used to escape situations, or to
get things faster, rather than turning and collecting.

Roll Attack: When you are running, press Up + A and Link will go into a roll
and come up into an attack. This is a good things when you don't want to
actually make contact until you are very close, or if you are trying to avoid
something.

Side Jump: TO make Link Jump to the side simply press Z + Left or Right + A.
Now you will be able to sidestep things that are trying to shoot at you, as
well as things rolling or anything you might have to evade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2 Cont... Links Attacks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, the attacks are only for the certain characters that Link is
forced to become, such as Deku Link. These are not the same for all of them.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deku Link:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the character you basically start out with, because you cannot play as
Link before he is turned into this creature. Deku Link is actually a pretty
fast runner, although he is short and many townspeople consider him a joke. He
is very in danger around flames, because he is basically a plant, so be
careful.

His Attack:
When you are playing as Deku Link, you have a pretty weak attack. Once you
press A e ill jump shortly and do a very fast spin that is capable of breaking
boxes and chopping plants, but is still not as good as a blade.

Other Moves:

Bubble: Link can shoot bubbles at his enemies if he is facing them from a
distance. The longer you hold the B button, the larger the bubble will become.
This is a good attack when you do not wish to get to close to an enemy.

Water Hopping: When you are on the water, you can press up constantly and link
will hope across the water as If he were on the land, this is pretty neat.

Deku Flower Jump: By standing on top of a deku flower, you can press A to dive
into the flower, and then press A again, and you will jump out of the flower
and be flying with spinning petals for a while, this is very useful.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Goron Link:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Goron Link is the second of your forms. He is stronger than Deku Link, but
still no substitute for the real things. Although he is massive, this does
effect his swimming abilities and his speed in some cases.

His Attack:

Ball Curls can be performed by pressing and holding the A button to roll
around, and eventually you will be able to roll right over your enemies,
because you will have become armored. This is stronger than Deku Link, but not
that great.


Other Moves:

Punch: This should probably have been classified as his actual attack, but it
was not. This is a massive punch with a very long boxers reach, which can smash
anything from boxes to boulders. If you time it correctly, it will me done in
in consecutive shot of up to 3.

Pound: The pound is a good way to defeat multiple attackers, because when you
are rolling, he will spring into the air and come down causing a very
tremendous force. DO not expect to kill all enemies with this every time
though.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zora Link:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

He Is by far the coolest looking of the creature Links and his attacks are
pretty cool as well. Although he can be damaged easily by things like fire, but
that is natural because he lives in the water. He also has the largest variety
of attacks out of all the Link creatures.

His Attack:

By pressing the B button for up to 3 attacks, Zora link will go Jackie Chan
style on you if your not careful. These attacks are a mix of power and the
martial arts, which makes them look really cool to watch.

Other Moves:

Swimming and diving are 2 very strong features that Zora Link has, which are
understandable, because Zora’s are aquatic life forms. But what is cool is how
you can navigate on the bottom of the water by holding the B button just as If
you were a human walking around up on land.

The boomerang which is used by holding and releasing B, is a good attack to use
when you want to keep your distance. Now if you are looking for something a
little more, you can use the barrier attack, which acts like an electric force
field, the command for that is R + B.

| Name: Kokiri Sword                                                  |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The Kokiri sword is a coveted treasure of the Kokiri Forest. It is  |
| also used in Ocarina of Time, when Link finds it in the Maze. Don't |
| let the size of the blade decieve you, it is very powerful indeed.  |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| Once you have become Kokiri Link again, meaning you are no longer   |
| Deku Link, this sword will be there automatically. Now to get its   |
| magic, just do as the fairy asks yous, and you will receive it too. |
|_____________________________________________________________________|

 _____________________________________________________________________
|                                                                     |
| Name: Razor Sword                                                   |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The Razor Sword is only a temporary upgrade from the Kokiri Sword.  |
| It is an extremely powerful, and much larger blade than the Kokiri  |
| as well as it does twice as much damage, literally.                 |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| You can only upgrade to this sword, by going to the blacksmith at   |
| Snowhead, it will cost you 100 rupees, believe me its worth it. It  |
| will only give you 100 hits before retorting back to the Kokiri.    |
|_____________________________________________________________________|

 _____________________________________________________________________
|                                                                     |
| Name: Gilded Sword                                                  |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The Gilded sword in a very powerful sword indeed, with its double   |
| timed blade, it is match for any oppressor. This does a lot more    |
| than the other two do, and it looks cooler, so get this quick!      |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| There is a little bit more that you have to do to obtain this one.  |
| First, you will have to have it upgraded again, by the blacksmith   |
| and you will also have to have some gold dust, this is permanent.   |
|_____________________________________________________________________|

 _____________________________________________________________________
|                                                                     |
| Name: Hero Shield                                                   |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| This too is your default weapon of that category, but it is not a   |
| bad thing to start out with. One Upped only by the mirror shield it |
| is very similar to the Hylian Shield seen in Ocarina of Time.       |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| As I already said, this is the default shield, and I believe that   |
| it is impossible to lose this one. I know the bird steals stuff,    |
| but even if he did you can buy them in the Clock Town trading post. |

|                                                                     |
| Name: Mirror Shield                                                 |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The highest one can go in the department of shields, not only in a  |
| battle can this one be used, but also when you have need to reflect |
| light onto something like a switch, this too was in Ocarina of Time.|
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| The Mirror shield is located under the well, and it will take a bit |
| of effort for you to get to this one. Although it is not altogether |
| hard, it is certainly not as easy as say the Hero Bow.              |

| The Sword of all Swords, it is basically Biggorons Sword with a new |
| name, but what is so cool is how you can have this and another one  |
| out at the same time, because this is a C button weapon, awesome!   |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| While you are in the Ikana Canyon, you remember how the Great Fairy |
| spoke of the other great ones who had been shattered, find all 15   |
| of the Stone Temple fairys and this blade is yours.                 |

| Description:                                                        |
| Also seen in Ocarina of Time, the game is basically not possible    |
| for you to beat without this item. It is very similar to the fairy  |
| bow, which is why I said it was in the last game, this is cool.     |
|                                                                     |

| The Hero Bow is located in a chest in the Woodfall Temple, it is    |
| not that hard to get, you just have to kill all of the enemies in   |
| the room to make the chest appear, make sure to save once you have. |

| One of Links most useful and necessary items, this basically allows |
| you to reach places that you other wise could not have. It can not  |
| lock onto anything but wood or certain switches, but that's ok.     |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| The Hook shot is in the Gerudo Fortress, kind of like it was in the |
| last game. Be careful when you are seeking this item, there is a    |
| great danger that lies in wait, but you should be able to kill it.  |

| The Ice arrow was also seen in the last game, turning whatever it   |
| hits to ice. It can freeze portions of water, and it even a way to  |
| create icebergs to get across certain place in the water.           |
|                                                                     |

| The ice arrow is found in the Great Bay Temple, you should not have |
| a problem, attaining it, because it is not really that well seen. I |
| would let you know this, do not become over confident with this.    |

| The magic that without it Link could not have defeated the evil     |
| Ganon. This can be used to stun enemies and to melt those blocks    |
| these are very powerful, but that is why they take alot your magic. |
|                                                                     |

| This ultimate fighter for good Is located in the Stone Tower Temple |
| you can expect a mediocre time getting to it, but not all that. I   |
| think you will greatly enjoy having this weapon in your inventory.  |

| The fire arrow may not be as powerful as the light arrow, but it is |
| certainly just as useful. It can be used to light torches in small  |
| groups at a time, or also to fight an enemy that is very powerful.  |
|                                                                     |

| This is located in the Snowhead temple, do not expect it to be as   |
| powerful as it was in the last game, although still very good. I    |
| think it has lost ome of its power, it takes away 2 magic points.   |

| The Lense of truth is located in Snowhead, in the very small village|
| in the mountains. Take note that this will use up your magic power  |
| the more you use it, and it will not turn itself off, you must.     |

| The Ocarina of Time, the magic talisman that helped to seal away    |

| You will get back the Ocarina of Time from Skull Kid when you have  |

| The main place to find these is the hole in the Deku Palace Gardens |
| but they can also be at swamp Akindo Nut. In the garden all you have|
| to do is buy them, there is no trial by fire or anything tough.     |

| The Deku Nut is one of the most basic items on the game, because it |
| is only a Nut that Link can throw. But, when it hits something or a |
| thing, it explodes into a bright flash that will stun your enemies. |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| Deku Nuts can be found just about anywhere, but one of the first    |
| places you can find them are in the Clock Town trading post. They   |
| are sometimes found when you cut up grass, or in any other stores.  |

| THE most basic of all the items, just a simple branch, But it does  |
| have its many uses. One of which is lighting things if you cannot   |
| or don't have the Bow yet. And you can hit things, but they break.  |
|                                                                     |

| This is probably also the most basic item to obtain, it can be found|
| in just about any store or shop or trading post, and it I usually a |
| thing you can get by chopping up the grass. They are not very pricy.|

| to him, he will still not allow you to buy it until then.           |

| The bombchu is kind of like a remote control mouse, rigged to blow  |
| up after a certain amount of time. It is pretty nifty, and you can  |
| even control where it goes. This is also seen in Ocarina of Time.   |
|                                                                     |

| The Bombchu can be bought at the bomb shop in Clock town, and most  |
| other stores as well. It can be found in a few treasure chests, but |
| not a lot. This is a good item to have but not 100% necessary.      |

| Location:                                                           |
| The first place you will find these is the bomb shop, but they can  |
| also be found in some of the other stores. They might be found if   |
| you are lucky while you chopping grass but that doesn't Happen much.|

                                                           |
| Name: Bomb Bag                                                      |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The bomb bag is a much better buy than just the bombs, even though  |
| it costs a little more. Because, you will be able to hold more of   |
| them, and it comes with 20 bombs already in there, alright!         |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| The best place to buy this is really at the bomb shop, and that is  |
| because it is the only place where you can buy this item. Make sure |
| you buy this before you leave clock town, you will be glad you did. |

| This is kind of a neat idea that they decided to put into the game  |
| for the first time. This will allow you to take pictures of any of  |
| the characters, but you can only have 1 at a time.                  |
|                                                                     |

| You will get this when you are in the Woodfall area, at the tourist |
| center where Tingles father is working. Go along with all the stuff |
| there and you will eventually receive this, listen closely to them. |

| Description:                                                        |
| An empty bottle is one of the most important things to get in the   |
| entire game. Without it, you cannot carry things like bugs, or any  |
| of the potions, blue fire, all very important stuff here.           |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| The bottles can be found in the following places, because there are |
| more than one: graveyard, racetrack, the milk bar obviously, the    |
| magic shop (swamp) and also in the waterfall area.                  |

| Description:                                                        |
| The moons tear is kind of an exclusive one time thing, atleast it   |
| has been so far, but it is very important so I put it in. Without it|
| you would not be able to fight Skull Kid and get back the Ocarina.  |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| After you are a bomber and you can go into the hideout, pass through|
| and go to the observatory. Look through the telescope and see where |
| it goes after looking at skull kid first.                           |

| Description:                                                        |
| This is the default setting for when you first get the heros bow    |
| from the woodfall temple. It will hold up to 20 arrows, that is not |
| a whole lot, so try not to waste them.                              |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| As I said before, this comes with the Hero bow, and luckily it will |
| already have it maximum of 20 arrows inside it when you get the bow.|
| Arrows can be bought or found in places.                            |

| Name: Large Quiver                                                  |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| This is one step up from the default quiver, and It can hold up to  |
| a maximum of 40 arrows! Now that is more like it eh?! So now you    |
| don't really have to be robin hood, bcause you can afford to miss...|
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| Ok, this is only found in the swamp shooting gallery or in clock    |
| town. To get it at either, you have to get the highest score, or in |
| the swamp a perfect score to obtain it from the gallery owners.     |

|                                                                     |
| Name: Biggest Quiver                                                |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The ultimate quiver, holding up to 50 arrows this is one fine tuned |
| ammo holder. Now that you can hold 50 arrows, you can afford to miss|
| once or twice and it no huge thing, jut don't make it a habit.      |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| Well, basically you have to do the same thing that you did for the  |
| large quiver, you just have to get a higher score than you did for  |
| did for that. I think it is easier if you do it in clock town.      |
|_____________________________________________________________________|

 ____________________________________________________________________
|                                                                     |
| Name: Giants Wallet                                                 |
|                                                                     |
| Description:                                                        |
| The giants wallet is a little harder to obtain, but then again being|
| able to hold 500 rupees is certainly worth it. Although, because of |
| how that game saves, you may never really reach 500, but close.     |
|                                                                     |
| Location:                                                           |
| To obtain this item, you have to kill all 30 of the Golden Skulltula|
| in the Oceanside spider house. Not so tough right? Well you only get|
| until the end of the day, so get crackin!                           |

===============================================================================
Chapter V: The Walkthrough
===============================================================================
************
 Clock Town
************

The first real thing you will actually have to after watching the scene with
Skull Kid, is follow him into the cavern. You are going to have to use the Deku
Flowers to get from platform to platform, and then when you finally do catch up
with Skull Kid, what does he do? He turns you into a Deku Scrub! Ok, well you
are going to have to deal with it, but look on the bright side, atleast now you
have a fairy to help guide you, eh? OK, now you are going to have to get into
Clock Town, but first you will talk with the Happy Mask man. Ok, he will tell
you if you can find the Imp and get back is precious item, then he will undo
what the Skull Kid has done.

There are some other things that you can do before North Clock town though:

Treasure Chest Game:
This is the first game that I have played so far, and it involves you having a
limited amount of time to get all the way across the checkered floor and open
the treasure box. Well, that doesn't seem to hard, but the little catch is that
you have to do it with the floor popping up, and you never know when it will
raise. Once it raises you will not be able to cross over that block of the
floor again for the rest of the game. Normally, if you get surrounded by the
blocks, you will have to go backtrack and then around. I have had pretty good
luck when I stay nearer the edges of the building. Once you win for the first
time, you will win 10 Deku Nuts! This game can be played as many times as you
want to.

Now, once you are actually in clock town, you need to find North Clock town.
Watch out for the white dog, that looks like the one that used to be in Ocarina
of Time, because it will attack you. Ok, once you are in North Clock town, you
will see a large man wearing a green suit, who claims to be a Kokiri, but never
got a fairy, but he is also selling maps. By the map of Clock town from him.
Now, go up the ramp and into the cave area. When you get inside Links will say:
" Oh no, the great fairy!", because she has been shattered! That's right, and
guess who it is up to to put her back together again.

Ok, you need to go to South Clock town, and then go up to the little water
canal. Now look directly to your left and you will see a very narrow passage or
alley, go down this, and you are in the same area as the fairy you need to
catch. Now, run across the water, using the Deku Hop technique, and get close
to the fairy. Ok, now she will tell you what do, so go back to the Fairy
Fountain in North Clock Town, and return her to her old self. Now she will
grant you the magic power we were used to in Ocarina of Time, except you get it
much earlier in this game than the last.

Ok, now go outside of the cave, and shoot the blue balloon with your bubble
shot, and then go talk to the bomber kid right there with the blow gun. He will
tell you about how they have a hideout and some stuff, then how you can learn
the code, if you can earn it. To do that you have to play hide and seek with
them. You will have until the next day to find all 5 of them, then you will
learn the secret code. Note, the code is never the same, so don't just turn the
game off after you learn it. A tip I received from Devin Morgan was "Start
earlier, so you'll have more time to find them all." That is a good idea.

Ok, once you have found them you will receive the password, and you can go to
where the little bomber kid stand guard, and give him the code, then he will
let you in. Now make your way into the Observatory, to get into the
Observatory, you will have to quickly get across the floating platforms and
then use your bubble to move the balloon away from the ladder. Now go up the
stairwell, and then talk to the Astronomer, who has also been in confrontation
with the Skull Kid. You will be asked to look for him with the telescope, and
you will see a tear drop fall. You can go get the tear drop and then give it to
the Deku Nut man. Now he leaves, and you can use the flower to fly to the ledge
of the clock tower.

Now eventually you will be allowed to enter the clocktower, and then you will
need to hit the Skull Kid with the bubble shot, and now you can get the Ocarina
back. Now play the song of time and then you can turn back time, thanks to
Zelda's memory that is. Now you will go back and talk to the Happy Mask Shop
owner and he teaches you the song of healing, now you are normal Link again!
Now you are back to the old style gameplay, where you can kinda do what you
want. Go back into Clock town and play some more of the games and stuff now
that you can save. Now you can buy things like the Shield from the trading post
there.

Also remember how the great fairy said that once you were back to your original
self that she would do something else for you, well, go check it out! I won't
give this away yet. Now, you can also plan on one thing, not being attacked by
the dog anymore, as well as being treated much better by some of the
townspeople who did not like the Deku Scrub going around. Make sure to explore
as much as possible, time is not a problem right now, but don't get used to
that, and try to get as many rupees as you can too. It might even be a good
idea to do the wallet deposit deal with the guy in west clock town. Here are
the price lists for some of the other places that you can visit to get
supplies:

The Clock Town Trading Post Catalog and Price List:
---------------------------------------------------
Ok, you can use this as a little check list to see how many rupees you need to
get to be bale to buy things, without going back and fourth between to the shop
and where you are collecting them. Remember that you can save now, and don't
forget once you buy a new item, or you will have to do it all again.

Store Location:
It is the middle shop in the little avenue in west Clock Town.

Boss Strategies

- Odolwa -

You do not actually have to defeat him, himself, but his magics of assistance.
He has a few different things he will try to use to kill you off, but if you
can manage to hol dhis attacks off long enough he is not all that hard. Just
make sure that you collect any hearts you receive for beating his attacks, you
may need them later. His attacks are Locusts, fire, scarabs(sp?), blocks.
Overall, you should be able to handle him, but feel glad he was not as hard as
he looks! After defeating him you will get his remains in mask form and a heart
container.

Ok, your not done yet, you have to get the Deku Princess out of the vines that
are located behind you. Now take her back to the Deku Palace, and now that you
have all 15 of the fairies,, if you do, you can go back to the Great Fairy of
Magic and get what is coming to you. Except this time the fairy is in a
different place. She is near the woodfall wall, eventually you will find the
hole. And when you do you will be happy with your reward, and to recap, you
know have the Hero Bow as well, and that is great!

Ok, now it is time to do what you promised you would, in helping out to save
the cows from the alien thieves. Now you are going to have to use the bow shoot
them once they are in range, and when you shoot one, don't stop, you have to
last until 6AM and then the aliens will retreat and you have saved the Ranch!
You will most likely want to come back to the ranch a little before that if
possible, because you don't know what delays you might face, so just leave a
little early. Now it is on to the Snowfall area!


I.    The Ikana Graveyard
II.   The Ikana Canyon
III.  The Well
IIII. The Ancient Castle
V.    Stone Tower
VI.   Stone Tower Temple


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I-The Ikana Graveyard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off, you will need Epona to ride over the fences to get to the graveyard.
Don't worry about the Real bomchu's, they can't hurt you as long as you're on
Epona. Now, right before the cemetery, you will see a small circle of stones.
Use the lens of truth to see a soldier, talk to him and he will ask you for
some red potion, once you give it to him, the stone mask is yours. This is one
of the coolest masks in the game. If you get sick of fighting enemies just whip
out the stone mask and the enemies (being as stupid as they are) won't even see
you! Now if you walk through the graveyard and up a trail, you will meet the
incredibly lazy Captain Keeta, the only way you can wake this giagantic
skeleton up is by playing the song of Awakening. Captain Keeta will quickly
jump to his feet(damaging a few buildings while he's at it),and run away,
daring you to try and catch up with him. Here are a few things that will make
the race with him a tad bit easier, first the gates will try and roast you with
fire, to aviod becoming barbequed Link, defeat the stalchildren that are at the
gate. Second, if Captain Keeta gets to fast, simply fire a couple of arrows at
him to slow him down a bit. Finally, if you catch up with Captain Keeta, battle
him with your sword, when you see an opening, make a run for it and get to the
treasure chest at the end of the trail. If you manage to get to the treasure
chest before Captain Keeta, you will get the Captains hat, which will let you
talk to the stalchildren in the graveyard at night. Order the stalchildren to
dig up a grave each night, after they open a grave on the first night, go in to
get a chest full to the brim with rupees. Now, light all the torches to open a
door. Here you'll get to fight the infamous iron knuckle. Send this guy packing
to met Flat, a composer and learn the song of storms. Have the stalchildren dig
up yet another grave on the 2nd night to get to another grave, use your lens of
truth inside the grave to find a secret door. Yet again, go into the grave the
stalk children dig up on the 3rd night, here you'll find Dampe, the gravedigger
from Ocarina of time. If you use z-targeting, walk backward, and lead him to
the patches of ground to get him to dig something up (tip: go very slowly).
Once he digs something up, a big Poe will attack. Fight it by using your shield
when it attacks, and slashing it while it twirls around in circles. If you
defeat the Poe, your reward will be a bottle. Now it's time to go to Ikana
canyon. There is a little thing (that's the best I can describe it ) wearing a
mask on a high ledge, talk to it wearing the Garo mask, which you can get from
the Gorman brothers, and a small wood block will appear, hookshot it to get to
Ikana canyon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II-Ikana Canyon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wear the Garo's mask while your in the Canyon, a ghost ninja will attack
you. Kill it, and you will get some advice for your adventures ahead. Now go
north to spring water cave, there you'll meet Sharp, Flat's brother. When you
met him, he will teach you a song that will drain your health. Play him the
song of storms, this melody will lift his curse and start up  the Music Box
House's waterwheel. The girl at the music box house is very suspicious of
everything, and won't let you go in if she's home. Place a bomb at her doorstep
and she'll come outside, if she doesn't spot you, you can sneak inside. Go to
the houses basement and talk to the strange men there, play the song of healing
to him before the
 pesky girl comes to kick you out. For your pains, you'll get the Gibdo mask.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III-The well
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply follow the uphill road behind the Music box house to get to the creepy
well. To get past a door that the mummy guards, give them what they want,
you'll need blue potion,5 pods of magic beans, milk , 10 bombs, 10 deku nuts, a
fish, and a big Poe. By handing over all these items, you'll finally get to a
room that contains the mirror shield, shoot the four braziers with a fire arrow
to claim your prize.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IV-Ancient Castle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enter the Castle, just find a sign that says the doors will never open, go
to the left of the sign to see a small hole, go in and hit the switch to make
the place a lot brighter, use your mirror shield to send the light onto the sun
emblem on the block. Now enter the castle(here ,whip out the gibdo mask
whenever you see a zombie, mummy ,or redead). First melt the ice switch to open
a doorway, In this room, the floor shaped like a checkerboard is hot, so you
can't get across. Spin into the switch as a deku scrub, now quickly scamper to
the flower underneath the floor. Move the floor upward by jumping out of the
flower, then go back into the flower and launch to a pillar. Step on the
switch, shoot the crystal, then run to the exit. Clear out the mines with your
hookshot, then as a deku use the flower to fly to a switch on the left side.
Step on the switch, and use the lens of truth to see a platform. While your on
the platform, kill the skulltula, then leap to the ledge and exit to the next
room. Follow the stairs to the top of the castle, and follow the roof's ledge
to the front of the place. Now hop onto the flower there, and fly to the switch
on the pillar nearby. By hitting the switch, you'll allow light to come into
another room. Now go back to  the beginning of the temple ,and this time shoot
a fire arrow at the switch to the right. Enter the room, and battle the
floormaster, after he's toast, use the mirror shield to melt the sun stone. In
the next room, you'll have to fight the  extremely annoying Wizrobe. He's just
like the wizrobe from Snowhead dungeon, except he shoots fireballs. After
defeating him, head up the stairs. Walk along the castle roof until you reach a
cracked area, use your powder keg to blow it up, and the sun will now be able
to shine into the entrance. Here, use your mirror shield to blast some rays
onto the sun stone, then enter the previously blocked passage. Now get ready,
cause it's time to fight Igos Du Ikana (translation=skeleton dude).First,
you'll have to fight his soldiers. Now, fend off the skeletons with your sword,
then hit the curtains with your fire arrow. Now slash the skeletons until they
fall, then reflect the light on their remains to get to fight the boss. Simply
hit him with an arrow, then shine some light on him. After you have finally
defeated him, he will teach you the elegy of emptiness, which lets you make
copies of yourself(very useful for switches and stuff).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V-Stone tower
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By weighing down switches with copies of yourself, you'll be able to use
floating blocks to reach the top. Be prepared for a lot of boulders and enemies
along the way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI-Stone tower temple
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First thing, shoot the left  eye in the statue in front of you. Now in the next
room, bomb the wall. Now, as Darmani, smash some crates to get to some small
boxes. Place them on switches and use the elegy of emptiness for the ones left.
Once there all weighed down, the courtyard door will open; bomb the square
there that doesn't have plants by it. If you do this, light will shine into a
room downstairs. Go back to the room with the switches and head up the stairs
to get to this room. Reflect light onto the sun stone. Cross the lava (make
sure your Darmani) and open the chest for the dungeon map. Bomb the Armos
statues to get a key before you leave, then use your key on the locked door in
the courtyard. Put on your zora mask, and swim straight into the dexihand's
(yes, I'm serious, it may sound like suicide, but you will get thrown onto a
ledge that contains a key).Now defeat the dexihand and swim down the passage.
In this room, destroy the mines and press the gold switch, for an upside down
chest to appear, which you can't get yet. Shoot the fire arrow at the frozen
switch to get another chest that you can't get yet(patience is a virtue..).Last
of all, reflect the light into the mirror, then use the mirror to melt the sun
stone. Go through the door, here turn into darmani and punch the column until
there aren’t any more pillar sections. Now reflect the light at another mirror,
and then from the mirror to a sun block, then melt the block in the east by
going to the middle of the room and reflecting the light to a mirror there, and
from the mirror to the block... yada, yada, yada.... Now fly from air vent to
air vent as a deku in the next room to get to yet another room. Here you will
fight the Garo master for the light arrow. Hit him with an ice arrow, then
slash him or use bombs. Now go all the way back to the entrance, and shoot the
arrow at the red jewel there, to turn the temple upside down. Step on a switch
to get rid of the block in front of the red jewel, then hit it. First look at
the freaky view. then Open the chest in front of you, enter the door on the
right and use the light arrow to melt the sun stone. The vents in the next room
will make you fly if your a deku, fly to the middle bridge, hit the switch
there to make a

chest appear, and nap the key to the upper door. Shoot the red jewel across the
way with a light arrow to flip the room, then cross the lava. In the next room,
look at the ceiling, the square mark is where you'll need to push the block.
Push it until you reach a raised part of the floor, then flip the room by
shooting the switch with a light arrow, repeat until the block's in place. Once
again, it's time for that enemy known as Wizrobe...yawn. Anyway, you should
have the hang of this guy by now. When he's good and dead (and for the last
time to, thank goodness),a chest will appear, use your hookshot on it to make
your exit. Kill the poes in this new room, then as a deku, fly to a platform
across the way. Now launch to a hallway to the right and fire light arrows at
the armos statues. Now weigh down the switch with the help of the elegy of
emptiness to get a key. Now return to the platform by the poes, and enter the
next
 room. Get rid of the mines, then fly as a deku to where the mines were, and
then use the flower to get to the platform leading to the next room, now go
through the door here to get to fight Gomess. Use the light arrow and then your
sword, when he's history you'll get the boss key. Now backtrack to the room
with the poes, when you reach the flower at the end of the room, turn left and
go through the door. Here, the armos statue guards a floor switch, attack the
enemy, then shoot the switch with your light arrow to make a chest appear,
hookshot to it and enter the  next room. Kill the eyegore there to get the
giant's mask. After using your hookshot to get to the Boss, it's time to fight
the giant twinmold! Use the giant's mask and hit either it's tail or head with
arrows or your sword. Now, pat yourself on the back, you just finished Stone
temple!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Battle (Fierce Diety)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After all that hard work your finally here, and you have the fierce diety on
you. Well, lets just have some fun with Majora.

Form 1, Majoras Mask: This is a strange part of the fight, actually attacking
the mask! Also real simple too, with that enormous, pointy, deadly projectile
blade. You might have to dodge its attacks which are pathetic a dive at you, I
know your shaken now so start firing that beam at it. 4-6 projectiles should
send in the Calvary...

Form 2, Team Mask: Thats what it is though a team of masks that are all the
same
besides appearance. Well Majora and the new recruited boss masks are smaller
now so don't get cocky. Majora is now faster which was necessary and has a
flame thrower. The other masks mostly just dive at you or fire they're own weak
beam (I have only seen one fire though). Anyway the strategy for form 1 works
again, although getting the boss masks out of the way might be a good idea (3
hits to take 'em down), because they will follow you through the other forms.

Form 3, Majora’s Incarnation: This is so odd, the mask becomes a giant running
blood vessel. It took me a couple of times to figure out the attacks of this
because Fierce Diety can take it out in some sword play or projectile shots in
3 seconds. If you come into this targeting him and shooting he'll die. I know
one of his attacks his well knocking you down from running. This thing is quick
as you can tell from the long lengthy blood vessel legs. A cinch, too bad.

Form 4, Majora’s Wrath: A challenge? Sadly no, Oni Link or Fierce Diety is just
too powerful for Majora. Some more projectile shots will kill this one which by
the way strolled out of resident evil and fell on to the Majora’s Mask
cartridge. Its long arms can really hurt you, especially when the arms spin
real fast. Although you will probably not see those attacks.

Overview: Sadly Majora could have been tougher even with the fierce diety mask.
Nintendo just basically gave up with this battle  offering no challenge. Next
time Nintendo puts in a ultimate weapon maybe they'll find the ultimate
opponent. Enjoy your Ending!

Mask. He is the main character of the game, and looks better than ever before!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Skull Kid: |
--------------

This is the guy who basically screwed up everything, him and that Majora's
Mask. He is the one who had the fairies startle Epona, then stole the Ocarina.
In the end who will triumph, Link, or this little man?...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tatl: |
---------

This is one of the fairies that helped the Skull Kid out when he knocked Link
Off of Epona. She was left behind because she decided to mess around, and now
she has become Links partner for the time being, not quite Navi, but ok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tael: |
---------

This nasty little fairy is the other who helped Skull Kid. It is Tatl's
brother, and didn't even care that Tatl was left behind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Epona: |
----------

Epona is Links horse which he received from Lon Lon Ranch back in Hyrule. She
Gets stolen from him by Skull Kid, but will he ever see her again?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Astronomer |
==============

The astronomer is a bit shaken up after he has his encounter with the Skull
Kid, but he does let you use the telescope. He seems like an ok guy, although
you aren't around him that much.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Jim |
=======

The leader of the Bomber Kids, and the one who makes you play hide and seek
with the little brats as Tatl puts it. He seems like a nice kid, although he is
a little small to be wandering the streets at night, with a mini gang at his
command, where is this kids parents?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Great Fairy of Magic |
========================

The great fairy was also in the last Zelda game for the N64, and she is
basically the big boss of the fairies. She gave you the magic in this game just
like she did the last time. She also says to come back later and she will help
you with some more stuff...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Bomber Kids |
===============

The bomber kids are a small group of kids that live in a hideou tin Clock town,
although they don't seem to ever be asleep. They hold the key to the
Observatory, and they are a pain in the butt to find during the hide and seek
game. They can really run fast when they want too, so be swift.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Happy Mask Man |
==================
If any of you have played Majora's Mask, then are familiar with this guy. He
Is basically the one who allows you to turn back into yourself, or normal Link
That is. He goes around selling masks to people, but apparently Skull Kid hit
Him and knocked him out and then stole the Majora's Mask, and of course he has
Looked at you to stop Skull kid, or as he says, something really, really bad is
Gonna happen. Its kind of funny the dumb look he gets when he is upset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Yoga People |
===============
I am not sure what is up with these people, but you think they could atleast
Be a little bit nicer to the kid who is gonna save them all! IF you go up to
Them at night when they are practicing she yells at you to leave them alone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The Mayor of Clocktown |
==========================
The Mayor is very undecided about what to do regarding the carnival in Clock
town because the moon might be falling. He has 2 sides arguing and all he can
do is nod his head and make noised for both of them. His wife seems to be
tougher than he is, but you wouldn't let the moon fall, now would you?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Reck Crew |
=============
Well, this is noone special, just the guy who has to clear the boulder from
Milk Road. He says he will get it done very quickly, but he is full of it. It
Ends up taking him like 3 days to do it! He seems nice though, because he will
stop hitting the rock If you get close so you do not get injured.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Ramoni |
==========
Geez, why don't you just ask Link to do something weirder! "Oh, will you save
My ranch from Alien cow snatchers? Well, anyway she seems like a very nice girl
Kind of playing the same role that Malon did in the last game, except Ingo has
Not taken her as his laborer slave.




===============================================================================
Monster Section:
===============================================================================

Skulltula:

Description:
------------
These are the larger and less powerful versions of the Gold Skulltula's, that
were also seen in the last game. One side of them is armored, so you will have
to wait until they spin around to kill them. There stomach is very soft and one
or two hits, dependning on your weapon should dispose of them rather easily.

*****************************************************************************

Gold Skulltula:

Description:
------------
The Gold Skulltula played a huge role in the last game, by cursing the House of
Skulltula remnants. Now basically they play the same sort of really dark, but
easy to kill role. DO not touch them anywhere, except with a weapon. You will
receive a token for killing these. These can be found almost anywhere if you
just get lucky, or know where to look.

*****************************************************************************

Fire Keese:

Description:
------------
These are quite possibly the most annoying enemies known to man. They fly at
you out of almost nowhere in some cases, and burn you up, and in the last game
they could even burn your shield! Get rid of these before they even have the
chance to touch you at all, and you will be glad. Although, they are usually
only encountered in darker, enclosed areas.

*****************************************************************************

Ice Keese:

Description:
------------
These are much like their close cousin the fire Keese, when you come into
contact with one of them, you become frozen. So it is best to take them out
before they get close enough to do that, so I would say that the Hero Bow is
your best bet, and make sure one shot does it.

*****************************************************************************

Armos:

Description:
------------
These were also featured in the last game, the living statues which stay
dormant until they are touched by someone. The goron punch should do the trick,
one followed by another, and be careful, they are rigged to blow.

*****************************************************************************

Stalchild:

Description:
------------
These are very skeleton like creatures, which were in the last game, remember
they come out at night. Well, they are very annoying and you should be able to
get rid of them pretty easily, although if you stand around you will be swarmed
eventually, so keep yourself moving.

*****************************************************************************

Poe:

Description:
------------
Poe the ghost, quite an evil and mean spirited little devil. He was in the last
game, as Poe and then Big Poe. He will come out in certain places and basically
annoy and taunt you until you do something, he can damage you, contrary to what
a lot of people think, he is more than a floating sheet.

*****************************************************************************

Dodongo:

Description:
------------
These were also seen in the last game, in there not fully evolved form. They
are fire breathing giant lizards, resembling an Iguana. You can com eat them
from behind, but they are actually pretty quick for their size. So your best
bet is a distanced bombing, although they are kind of fun to battle.

*****************************************************************************

Beamos:

Description:
------------
These were seen in excess at Dodongos Cavern and a couple other places in
Ocarina of time, they are pretty annoying if you ask me. They shoot a laser
beam out of that eye, so watch your step, although in most cases in can be out
run if you start far enough ahead. A bomb will destroy them, so don't even try
a blade.


*****************************************************************************

Wolfos:

Description:
------------
These were seen in Ocarina of Time as the guards at the beginning of the forest
temple, they have cruel intentions, but they are much more wussy than they
appear. Your sword is all that you should need, and you may have to stay on
your toes for a bit, but eventually he will turn his back and let down his
guard.

*****************************************************************************

Mad Scrub:

Description:
------------
If these aren't the biggest cowards in the game what are? These live in the
Deku flowers, and they pop up when you are in range and shoot Deku Seeds at
you, except they are larger than was once in Links slingshot. The harder thing
about these is that they pop out of a lot of places behind you, so you don't
know that they are there until you have already been hit. Just use the Z
targeting and reflect there seed back at them with your shield.

*****************************************************************************

Deku Baba:

Description:
------------
These are officially the meanest plants ever! Wow, if you are not careful in
the start of the game, one of these could be your downfall. These are very
fierce man eaters, you remember them from OoT, the snapping flowers, huge
teeth, ya that's them. So try to stun them and then hit them after.

*****************************************************************************

Dragonfly:

Description:
------------
This is not my choice of the nicest enemy on the game, sporting a mean electric
tail stinger, he is out for blood. Try to keep away from this at all costs, but
if you are forced into combat, use an arrow and he falls just like the rest.

*****************************************************************************

Red Chuco:

Description:
------------
If you destroy this creature you will receive a heart piece, so if you do
happen to lose anything to it, you can quickly get it back. This is an odd
looking creature, and is not usually avoidable if you get to close to it, so
just kill the thing.

*****************************************************************************

Blue Chuco:

Description:
------------

A close relative to the Red Chuco, all the same except that it does NOT have a
recovery heart in it, I have been told that you can freeze it with an Ice Arrow
and it become a type eof stepping stone, ill just have to find out for myself.

*****************************************************************************

Bird Thief:

Description:
------------
Well, this is probably the most annoying enemy on the game besides the Keese
Because he can steal you stinking items! What is up with him? Well, whenever
You are in Termina field you have to be very careful, because it is not fun
Trying to get all of your items back once they are gone. Although, he can be
killed it is not that easy.


===============================================================================
Chapter VII: The Masks
===============================================================================

Deku Mask:
~~~~~~~~~~
Obviously by its name this would have something to do with Link and the Deku's.

like you started out the game with. When he is in this form he will be able to
talk to other Deku creatures and things like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Bremen Mask:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

bit. This is used to complete Grogs task, and it makes the animals follow you,

===============================================================================
Chapter IX: Authors Notes
===============================================================================

Well I know I said that I would never come back and do anything to this guide,
but it just looked so bad that I had to come back and try to reformat it. I
have changed in some more practical art, better dividers, fixed most of the
grammatical errors and anything else I could find. Obviously there are probably
things I missed, please don’t email me about them. This guide is finished. On
another note, this is no longer a co-authored guide; I am now the sole author.

===============================================================================
Chapter X: Final Thoughts
===============================================================================

Ok, this is the very first version of the guide, and I realize it is not 100%
Complete or anywhere near that, so please just bear with me, as I am planning
Daily updates for the next several weeks to get this guide where it needs to
Be. If you have anything that you want to contribute, please feel free, but I
Cannot promise that anything sent would be posted. Also note, this is my first
Zelda guide, so this should be pretty interesting...

*Jump up in time quite a few months*
Well the guide is done, and it was certainly interesting. It is now as complete
as it is going to be, unless people send in things, but that it the only case
it will be updated. So, see you later.
