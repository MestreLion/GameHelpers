FAQ/Walkthrough Copyright © 2000-2002
VERSION: 3.3
AUTHOR: Bedman
LAST UPDATED: 7-26-02

           *** NEW UPDATE ON E-MAIL: PLEASE READ NOTE BELOW ***

I am only 16, I do not want any pornography. Don't waste your time sending me
porn spam. If you do, I will forward your e-mail to TOSSpam@aol.com and they
will deal with it. DON'T SEND ME SPAM! If you happen to use an aol e-mail ad-
dress to send me spam, I will send it to TOSEmail1 and AOL will ban your ac-
count. DON'T SEND ME SPAM!

NOTE TO ALL WHO HAVE E-MAILED ME AND WHO ARE PLANNING ON E-MAILING ME SOON:
My computer has been having some major freezing problems, seeing as how it's
a Compaq with an AMD processor and it's 3 years old (and it's a laptop). So,
this basically means I have highly limited Internet access until the problem
can be repaired. I'm stuck working on my new FAQs on a really ghetto dinosaur
of a computer that I used to use back before something called Windows 95 came
out. So, if you have a question, please check the Walkthrough / FAQ / etc. here
instead of e-mailing me. If, after you have checked the entire document and
your question is not answered, then you can e-mail me at bedman@mail.com and
wait for quite a while to receive an answer. I still want anything other than
questions as well, such as contributions, offers of friendship, errors, etc.
just FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THINGS THAT ARE GOOD AND TRUE AND NOBLE, DO
NOT SEND ME ANY SUPER PROMOTED ADVERTISING MAIL, ALSO COMMONLY KNOWN AS SPAM!!!
And also, PLEASE get your computer checked for viruses ASAP, as I usually re-
turn to find my e-mail provider saying "Your account has run out of space,
please delete some files" because somebody with an infected computer sent me an
e-mail and I then have to delete twenty billion copies of Klez out of my e-mail
box. That's all I have to say for now, except one more thing: I apologize for
all of this, I am certainly feeling more pain from all this than you, but I am
sorry for not being able to respond to all your e-mails :-(

BTW, because of this freezing problem, I haven't been able to proofread V 3.3
before submitting it, so there may be a few wonky problems, just try to ignore
it until I can check everything better.

NOTE TO ALL WHO HAVE E-MAILED ME: FCMail no longer exists because of stupid
reasons. This means that I lost every single e-mail that was ever sent to my
very first e-mail account *sniff* If you sent any questions or contributions
to that address, please forgive me, it wasn't my fault. 

NOTE TO ALL WHO HAVE E-MAILED ME: AOL no longer exists... er, just kidding. For
now, I can't access my AOL e-mail so please send all e-mail to bedman@mail.com.

If you want to copy / quote / redistribute this FAQ, see the COPYRIGHT section
at the end for details.

If possible, please read the E-MAIL section in the OTHER STUFF section before
you e-mail me with non-Majora's Mask related mail. If you need to ask me some-
thing about Majora's Mask, PLEASE feel free to e-mail me!

This FAQ / Walkthrough is basically complete! I may add a couple things later,
but it's done for now. Sorry for taking so long, I wrote the update like back
in October 2001 or something, and I just didn't get around to submitting it.

In other news, my bedman@fcmail.com address no longer exists because they shut
down FCMail >:-(. Send all your questions, comments, flames, etc. to:
bedman@mail.com and DON'T YOU DARE SEND SPAM!!! Also, WHquestion shut down. I'm
really really sad :'-( ... *sniff* it was the best site I ever knew... But now
I am also a neopets user (www.neopets.com). If you want to be my neofriend, my
username is Bedman (duh).

Also, if you're trying to send me an IM and it doesn't look like I'm online,
check to see if I'm online under the username of USJokerBedman. Please do NOT
send ANY e-mail to this address since I almost never check it.

One other note: Up until now, I've been storing this file on a floppy disk.
That floppy disk decided to go completely crazy and delete certain sections of
my files. The result: I have to patch up some areas that were deleted with data
from older versions of this file. Fortunately, nothing new was deleted and I am
now storing my FAQs on my hard drive to be safe. I should have all the deleted
areas replaced before I upload this, but if something seems really unusually
tweaky, it means that I haven't gotten around to replacing it. Send me an e-
mail with the exact location of the problem. Funny, I even switched disks, but
BOTH of them have been giving me the same problems....

-*- OVERVIEW -*-

Zelda games often have unusual things, but this game is the most unusual of all
Zelda games. It doesn't take place in Hyrule, but in a parallel world called
Termina, where everyone looks like someone else in Hyrule. The Cucco Lady from
Kakariko Village is the Innkeeper in Clock Town, the central town of Termina,
and the Running Man from Hyrule Field is the Town Postman. Some items are re-
turning, but some of them can now be used by Young Link, the only age you'll be
using in this game. You will have to travel through time, but instead of going
forward seven years, you have to go back three days. What happens on the third
day? The moon will fall right out of the sky.... You'll have to go back in
time to the beginning of your quest, though you keep most important items.
Events that you watched once will unfold again, and some you'll be able to stop
from happening. A poor old woman is attacked and a Bomb Bag shows up at an
illegal shop a day later. If you save the old woman, the Bomb Bag reaches it's
true destination and goes on sale at the Bomb Shop. You can watch the carpent-
ers construct a tall wooden tower for the upcoming carnival, then you travel
back in time and it reverts to it's original shorter height. So what do you
need to do to win? Simple. Find something(s) to stop the moon from falling. And
you only have the same three days to do it.

-*- OOT / MM COMPARISON -*-

You should know, of course, that Majora's Mask is the sequel to The Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the N64. For those of you who are relatively new to
the Zelda series, please note that there were four and fifty-one hundredths
other Zelda games that came before OoT: The Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2: Link's
Adventure (both for the NES), A Link to the Past (SNES), Link's Awakening (GB),
Link's Awakening DX (GBC, that's where the fifty-hundredths comes in), and the
Second Worst Game of All Time: Wand of Gamelon for the Phillips CD-i system, or
something like that (trust me, you really really really don't want to know what
the game is like, and you also don't want to know what Nintendo was thinking
when they endorsed it... in case you're math skills are poor, that's the one-
hundredth, though it doesn't really deserve that much). Also for those who are
new to the series, please don't call Majora's Mask "Zelda 2" because Zelda 2 is
the title of one of the old-school NES Zelda games. I get a little confused
when people are like "I need help with Zelda 2" and I'm like "I don't know much
about it, I'm really more of an expert on Majora's Mask...." Also, there have
been two games for Game Boy Color released since Majora's Mask (Oracle of Ages
and Oracle of Seasons), and there is another half-game coming out for GameCube
called The Legend of Zelda: Link Joins the Powerpuff Girls. It uses "innovative
cel-shaded graphics" that make it look like a Powerpuff Girls cartoon.

Now, for those of you who aren't new to the series and you haven't yet played
much of MM, here's a list of the similarities and differences between OoT and
MM:

Differences:

- Link is slightly older than kid Link from OoT
- Only one age (no adult Link)
- Instead of traveling back and forth seven years, you repeat the same 3 days
over and over
- There are three times the masks for a total of 24 masks to collect, many with
special uses, plus you can carry more than one at a time!
- Expansion Pak Only (it's worth it)
- The graphics are better (because of previously mentioned Expansion Pak)
- More enemies to fight (also because of Expansion Pak?)
- Only four dungeons, which means that there are WAY more pieces of heart, plus
more sidequests and mini-dungeons to make up for the low number of dungeons
- Saving is confusing and frustrating at first, and you may not like the game
when you first start, but you'll love it after a while
- The atmosphere is more tribal than medieval
- There are stars at night :-)
- There are more character voices (YAH! UH! YAY!)
- You can't switch between swords and shields, upgrades replace old ones
- Young Link can use the Bow and Hookshot, no Slingshot or Boomerang
- Zelda theme music :-)
- More characters, more personality, more humor
- Dinging fairy instead of "Hey!" "Look!" "Listen!"
- More obnoxious and annoying enemy descriptions from previously mentioned
fairy (Don't you know anything? That's a deku baba! It's easy! Just... whack
it with your sword or something!)
- Stranger story line, but not too difficult to understand
- Incredibly pathetic final boss (there are ways to make it harder)
- Better warp system
- Species transformations (deku, goron, zora) with new musical instruments
- More mini-games
- No pesky golden skulltulas everywhere (only in two locations...)
- New enemies (duh)
- No magic items (Din's Fire, Farore's Wind, Nayru's Love)
- New items (Pictograph Camera, Powder Keg)
- More complex, unique, bizarre dungeons

Now for a few similarities...

- Same basic engine
- Many of the same character appearances
- A few returning Ocarina songs
- Some of the music is the same (like the shop music, mini-game music,
house music, etc.), but sometimes it sounds like it's coming from a cheap radio
- Some returning enemies
- Items such as Deku Sticks / Nuts, Bombs / Bombchus, beans, etc.


-*- OLD THINGS -*-

If you played Ocarina of Time, you can probably skip this section. This section
just goes over the basics of the game, which you should already know if you
played Ocarina of Time. It's also mostly covered in the manual, so if you read
the manual, you won't learn much.

- CONTROLS -

The controls for this game are pretty simple. Here's a list of the basics:

A BUTTON:          VARIOUS (OPEN, SPEAK, NEXT, CHECK, PUT AWAY, ATTACK, etc.)
B BUTTON:          ATTACK WITH SWORD (SOME MASKS CHANGE THIS)
Z BUTTON:          CENTER CAMERA, Z-TARGET
R BUTTON:          RAISE SHIELD
L BUTTON:          TOGGLE ONSCREEN MAP, TURN OFF OCARINA EFFECTS AND ANIMATION
START BUTTON:      PAUSE GAME
C UP BUTTON:       LOOK AROUND W/ 1ST PERSON, LISTEN TO TATL
C LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN: USE ITEM(S) SET TO C BUTTONS
CONTROL STICK:     MOVE CHARACTER, CURSOR

- Z-TARGETING -

Z-Targeting is a useful technique used to keep Link's attention on one enemy or
object. While Z-Targeting, attacks will be more accurate, and talking to people
or reading signs will be easier. Link will always face the item he has Z-
Targeted, and the controls will change slightly while using Z-Targeting. Once
you use it enough, you'll get used to it and it'll become natural. If you see
a colored arrow above an item, you can Z-Target it. Green arrows mean there's
a sign or something else you can check. A blue arrow means you can talk to a
person or thing. Yellow arrows appear above enemies.

There are two types of Z-Targeting that you can change in the OPTIONS menu, but
both of them use the Z Button found on the bottom of the controller. The two
options are SWITCH and HOLD. Switch is good for beginners. To use it, simply
tap the Z Button to target an enemy. Tap it again to stop targeting or to
switch to a different enemy. The Hold option is for more advanced players (like
me, obviously) who have mastered the Z-Targeting system. It's better, but can
be a little tougher to get used to. To use it, you must HOLD the Z-Button to
target an enemy. When you let go of the Z-Button, you'll quit using it.

Also while Z-Targeting enemies, you can press UP C to get a hint from Tatl.
Just be warned that she can make you feel like a doofus, especially if you ask
her about an enemy like a Deku Baba. She'll say "Don't tell me you don't know
about Deku Baba! It's easy! Hit it with your sword!" or something like that.
If you don't know about an enemy, though, it's probably best to listen to her
to figure out how to defeat it (or listen to my descriptions :-). We didn't
have anything like this in the older games... Zelda games these days are
just too easy. If you want a challenge, try playing Zelda II and you will think
Majora's Mask is sooo easy.

- OPTIONS -

You can only change these options on the Game Menu after the Title Screen.

SOUND
There are four options for sound. They are STEREO, MONO, HEADSET, and SURROUND.
Stereo is best on stereo TVs, while Mono is best on Mono TVs (meaning TVs with
only one speaker, I don't know why they ever made them like that). Headset is
best if you're using headphones, and Surround is if you have a really great
Dolby Surround Sound System.

Z TARGETING
The two options are SWITCH and HOLD. See the Z-TARGETING section for more
details.

CHECK BRIGHTNESS
At first, you may think this is for changing the brightness of the game. It's
not, it's for checking the brightness on your TV. If you can't see all four
shades of gray, adjust the brightness on your TV so that you can.

- MOVES / ADVANCED CONTROLS -

These are some moves that are returning from Ocarina of Time. Note that most of
these can only be used while Link is in his Hylian form.

Z = While Z-Targeting is active, or while holding Z without targeting an object

ROLL ATTACK
BUTTONS: CONTROL STICK UP + A OR Z + A WHILE SWORD IS PUT AWAY
USE: A general rolling attack, doesn't do much to enemies. Useful for destroy-
ing crates, pots, etc. and to knock items out of trees (and to make small cow
figurines' heads wiggle :)

NORMAL SWORD SWIPE
BUTTONS: B BUTTON (if sword isn't out, makes Link take out his sword)

BACK FLIP
BUTTONS: Z + CONTROL STICK DOWN + A
USE: To dodge enemy attacks, especially dodging the Iron Knuckle's axe.

SIDE JUMP
BUTTONS: Z + CONTROL STICK RIGHT / LEFT + A
USE: To dodge enemy attacks, especially dodging the Iron Knuckle's axe.

JUMP ATTACK
BUTTONS: Z + A + SWORD OUT
USE: Does twice the damage of a normal sword slash, but takes a bit more time
to get up afterwards, leaving you vulnerable to enemy attack.

STAB ATTACK
BUTTONS: Z + CONTROL STICK UP + B + SWORD OUT
USE: Quick stabbing attack using the sword, useful for stabbing enemies with
shields, or enemies that block normal sword slashes.

SHIELD STAB
BUTTONS: R + B
USE: While using your shield, you can make a quick stab at your enemy. You'll
quickly stab the enemy, and then you'll raise your shield right away.

GRAB / THROW / DROP
BUTTONS: A
USE: If there's anything you can lift (clay pot, small crate, small shrub,
snowball, Bomb, etc.) you can press A once to pick it up. Press A again to drop
it (while standing still) or to throw it (while moving).

GRAB / PUSH / PULL / CLIMB
BUTTONS: A + CONTROL STICK
USE: Use the A button to grab large blocks or other moveable things. Press UP
on the control stick to push it and DOWN on the control stick to pull it. Or,
to climb on top of it, push UP on the control stick (towards the block) and
then press A to climb on top of it when the blue icon says "Climb."

OPEN 
BUTTONS: A
USE: While standing in front of a door or chest, press the A Button to open it
up. Chests usually contain useful items. Sometimes, doors can be locked. If
a door has chains on it and a lock, you need a key to open it. If it has metal
bars on it, you must find a way to open the door (defeating all the enemies in
the room, pressing a switch, shooting an eye switch, lighting torches, etc).

- C-ITEMS -

If you've played other Zelda games, this will likely be familiar. You can set
different items to the bottom three C Buttons. To change the items, pause,
switch to the ITEMS subscreen, then press a C Button to set that item to that
C Button. While playing the game, press the C Button to use the item. I usually
keep the Ocarina set to the Right C Button, the Hero's Bow set to Left C, and
the Hookshot set to Down C, but you can choose to set any items to any buttons.
My advice: always set the items to the same buttons, if possible. This way, you
can take them out quickly without looking at what they're set to (example: I
never assign the hookshot to the left c-button, and I never set the Bow to the
bottom c-button and I never set anything but the Ocarina to the right c-button.
This allows me to immediately take out an item without looking at what button
it's assigned to as long as I know that it is assigned).

-*- NEW THINGS -*-

Most of this info was covered in the manual, but wasn't in Ocarina of Time.

- SAVING -

This drove me crazy the first few times, but you'll get used to it after a
while. To permanently save the game, you must play the Song of Time, but this
also sends you back in time to the beginning of the First Day. All events that
you cleared will revert to their original state, people's problems will return,
and dungeon puzzles will return to their original unsolved state. You'll also
lose all your rupees, arrows, Bombs, powder kegs, Bombchus, deku nuts, deku
sticks, etc. but you won't lose the ability to use them. You'll also keep all
important items (like the Bow and the Hookshot) and all the masks you have
collected (including the masks left behind after defeating a boss, which proves
you've beaten them at least once). In some ways, this is annoying, but in some
ways, it's good. It's sometimes fun to go back and pound the bosses again,
especially after you're a lot stronger (it took me about 5 minutes to beat
Odowla the first time, and 30 seconds once I got a bigger sword).

You can temporarily save the game, once you're Hylian again, using the game's
Interrupt Save feature. Once you whack an owl statue with your sword, you can
temporarily save the game by Checking the owl statue, then selecting "Yes" to
save temporarily. This means that when you begin the game again, you'll return
to the owl statue the same way you left it. BE CAREFUL! If you now turn off the
Nintendo 64, you'll lose all the stuff you've done since you last played the
Song of Time. To save again, either use the Song of Time, or save at an owl
again. This is kind of like a really long pause, but you turn off the N64. Just
like when you pause, you don't really save, it just stops for a while. Be sure
you save again after using the Interrupt Save, unless you want to lose every-
thing you did since the First Day.

Also, there's a way to save the number of rupees you have, even after playing
the Song of Time. You can deposit rupees at the Bank in West Clock Town. These
rupees will be saved and the guy will recognize you when you return (even if
you return as a Zora). I think this is because he stamps your hand or something
so he'll know you later when you return. You'll also get various rewards for
depositing a lot of rupees in the bank. After depositing 200 rupees, you'll get
a bigger wallet, and after depositing 1,000 rupees, you'll get about 5 rupees
(that's called "interest"). You get something even nicer for depositing 5,000
rupees....

- MOVES -

One of the most interesting things about Majora's Mask is that you can actually
change your form to become one of three different species. You'll have to
collect the three masks to transform into the different form, and each form has
it's own moves, strengths, and weaknesses. You'll often have to use a certain
mask when you least expect it, like transforming into a Deku Scrub in the last
temple to fly for short distances. Also, in each form, you'll take on the name
of the character you got the mask from (except the Deku Scrub).

DEKU LINK
A BUTTON:      SPIN ATTACK
B BUTTON:      BLOW BUBBLE (USES MAGIC)
R BUTTON:      HIDE UNDER WOODEN SHIELD

SPECIAL MOVES:

PINK FLOWER HELICOPTER
BUTTONS: Press and hold the A button while standing over a pink flower to
burrow. Aim, then release to pop out and fly using two spinning pink flowers to
fly for short distances. Control speed and direction with the control stick. 
Press A again to drop down, and B to drop Deku Nuts like little bombs (useful
for judging what you're above when trying to land on small objects).
USE: Useful everywhere to reach distant or higher platforms / ledges / objects,
etc. A required technique.

WATER HOP
BUTTONS: CONTROL STICK ON WATER
USE: You can hop across water up to 5 times. Use this to reach the other side
of water as a Scrub and to cross poisonous water. After the fifth hop, you will
fall into the water and sink, returning you to where you first hopped in (un-
less, of course, you reach the other side of the water or a lily pad).

WEAKNESSES: Fire, lava, falling from high places, and water.
SPECIAL INSTRUMENT: Deku Pipes

DARMANI (GORON LINK)
A BUTTON:      CURL
B BUTTON:      PUNCH (PRESS 3 TIMES QUICKLY TO INCREASE POWER)
R BUTTON:      DEFENSIVE POSITION
A + STICK:     ROLL (MAY USE MAGIC POWER)
A + B:         POUND

SPECIAL MOVES:

SPEED ROLL
BUTTONS: A BUTTON + CONTROL STICK, WAIT FOR SPIKES
USE: When rolling around, build up your speed until you have spikes sticking
out of your body. While using this special speedy rolling, you can kill most
enemies, bust through giant snowballs, and jump ramps to cross large gaps. You
can also use it to roll up steep slopes, but you don't need to have spikes
sticking out to roll up steep slopes.

STRENGTHS: Strong (pulling heavy objects)
WEAKNESSES: Falling from high places, jumping, and water.
SPECIAL INSTRUMENT: Goron Drums

MIKAU (ZORA LINK)
B BUTTON:      FIGHT (PRESS 3 TIMES QUICKLY FOR STRONGER ATTACKS)
HOLD B:        THROW FINS LIKE BOOMERANGS
R BUTTON:      SHIELD WITH FINS
R + SWIMMING:  ELECTRIC SHIELD
R + B IN WATER:ELECTRIC SHIELD
A IN WATER:    SWIM QUICKLY

SPECIAL MOVES:

SWIMMING
BUTTONS: A WHILE RISING / SINKING / FLOATING
USE: You can swim like a dolphin by pressing and holding the A Button while
floating in water. Move around with the Control Stick. Press UP on the Control
Stick to leap like a dolphin.

SURFACE / DIVE
BUTTONS: A OR B
USE: While in the water, you can dive (sink) by pressing B (unless you're
walking on the bottom), and you can surface (rise) by pressing A.

WEAKNESSES: Fire and ice.
SPECIAL INSTRUMENT: Mikau's Guitar

- THE CLOCKS -

There are two types of clocks in the game that you can learn how to read, one
that's easy and necessary, and one that's a bit tougher and not as useful. The
more important clock you should learn is the one that stays at the bottom of
the screen at all times. This tells you what day it is and what time it is (in
the game, obviously). The other kind of clock is the real ones that are all
over Clock Town. They use a different format, but they're similar to normal
clocks.

GAME CLOCK
Here's a rough picture of what the game clock at the bottom of the screen looks
like:
     _____
 7 /       \
 O    / \§   \
|     \ /     |

The "O" in the outer ring will either be the sun (6:00 am - 6:00 pm), or a moon
(6:00 pm - 6:00 am). Above the little sun or moon is a number. This is the
current hour of the day. In the middle is a green or blue diamond. 1st, 2nd, or
Final will be displayed here depending on the day. Around this diamond is a
small point of light (§). This shows what minute it is. One second of Real-Time
equals one minute of Game-Time (unless the Inverted Song of Time was played).
This means it will take one Real minute for this dot to travel around the
diamond. Once it reaches the top of the diamond, the hour indicator will change
to the next hour.

TERMINIAN CLOCK
Here's a rough picture of what a clock from Clock Town will look like:
    _______
   / __^__ \
  / /  C  \ \
 | |   |   | |
 |<|   |   |>|
 | |   |   | |
  \ \__0__/ /
   \   v   /
    ØØØØØØØ
C=SUN / MOON
0=HOUR INDICATOR
<, >, ^= BLUE DOT
v=MINUTE INDICATOR

It's kinda hard to draw like this, but you'll understand, it's not too hard to
figure out. The outer ring of the clock is the Minute Ring. There are four dots
around it's edges, and sixty little tick marks. One of the dots is red, the
other three are blue. As the Minute Ring turns, the red dot will travel around
it. It's read the same way as a minute hand on a clock, meaning if it's at the
top of the clock, it's at 0 minutes, if it's at the bottom of the clock, it's
30 minutes. The Hour Disk in the middle indicates the hour. There are four
symbols around it, but only two of them are used. One of them is a bigger red
circle. This points towards the hour, the same way the red dot is read. The
other, larger, symbol changes between day and night. During the day, a sun is
displayed. During the evening and night, a moon is displayed.

- DUNGEON FAIRIES -

This side-quest is optional and is similar to the Gold Skulltulas from Ocarina
of Time. It does, however, have a much greater reward. In each dungeon, there
are 15 lost fairies of the same color. They all look kinda ugly and have wings
sticking out the top of their enormous heads. They look just like the lost
fairy from Clock Town. You must rescue all 15 from each dungeon and return them
to the nearby Fairy Fountain (there's a Fairy Fountain near every dungeon).
Once you return all 15 mini-fairies, the big laughing fairy appears and gives
you a cool upgrade (though I do wish Nintendo would make these fairies a little
less... ugly). There are three upgrades and one special item you can get from
these big fairies (not counting the magic power you get from the first one in
Clock Town). For details about finding these fairies, see the SIDE MISSIONS
section.

- THE BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK -

This item can be found on the Quest Subscreen once you get it. Move the cursor
to it and press A to read it. This notebook contains pictures of 20 people
(once you meet them) and their schedule for the three days. To complete this
notebook, you must solve all these people's problems. It may seem like it's
unnecessary, but solving these problems will get you a lot more masks, pieces
of heart, bottles, etc. so it's worth your time to solve these problems. Also,
it may be confusing, so here's a rough picture of what a schedules might look
like:

          !          !                   !              !                    @
:)--------==-------=======||------------===---------||======-----------------=|
 |---------=====---=======||------------------------||------------------------|
             !       !

The little smiley :) is the person's face... I didn't have enough space since
each dash represents an hour for each day (and because GameFAQs.com requires
all FAQs to be 79 characters wide or less, 24 x 3 = 72, 79 - 72 = 7... ah,
nevermind). There are three columns, one for each of the three days. A red
arrow and a vertical line shows the current time of day. The ! @ and & are
symbols you'll see in the middle of the blue bars, and the blue bars (the ===
bars on mine) indicate when you can get an item or solve a problem. The (!)
symbol is to show an important event or a promise made to a person, or just a
problem was solved. A @ symbol (it's really a small green face) means you
received a mask from someone as a reward. A & symbol (a small red bow) means
you received a gift or other item from someone. Also note that not everybody
has two bars. That only happens when there are events or other notes that
happen at the same time. One final note: if you solve all the problems of a 
person, a small medal symbol like [|] with a red circled star on top will
appear to the right of their schedule. Also, when you play the Song of Time,
their problems will return, but your notebook will permanently record the fact
that you solved their problems. If you want the best ending, make sure you help
out all 20 people!

|STORY|
|óóóóó|

   It had been a long time since Link and Navi had separated after defeating
Ganon and saving Hyrule. Zelda had used the Ocarina of Time to return Link to
his younger age. Now, with the Ocarina and a new shield, new sword, and his
trusty horse Epona, Link set out to find Navi, his fairy friend. As he got
deeper and deeper into the Lost Woods, he recognized less and less of his sur-
roundings. He turned to take a look around, but Epona screamed and threw him to
the ground....
   He awoke a few minutes later. "Hey, Skull Kid, let me play!" said a shrill
little voice.
   "No way, you'd drop it and break it!" Laughter. Link slowly got up. A
strange little Skull Kid was turned away from him, playing a few notes on the
Ocarina of Time. Ding ding ding! Two fairies, a dark and a light, were trying
to get the Skull Kid's attention. He turned around with a jump when he noticed
Link, looked down at the Ocarina, and quickly hid it behind his back. Link
lunged at the Skull Kid, but he quickly leaped over Link's head onto Epona and
took off.
   Link quickly grabbed onto the Skull Kid's leg as the Skull Kid rode quickly
through the forest. Just before the Skull Kid reached a log tunnel, Link fell
off. The Skull Kid continued, and Link followed at a swift run. Little did he
know what lay beyond the log tunnel. He didn't have enough time to stop himself
as he plunged off a cliff into darkness.
   He landed on a small plant in the middle of a pool of water. Floating along-
side his two fairies, the Skull Kid explained what he had done with Epona. Link
was about to attack when the Skull Kid transformed him into a tiny little deku
scrub. Link stared at his reflection in disbelief. He was a little wooden crea-
ture, with a little green hat and shorts. Laughing, the Skull Kid began to
float away through a doorway. Link tried to follow, but Tatl, the light fairy,
stopped  him. Tael, the dark-colored little brother of Tatl, noticed too late.
The door slammed shut. The two fairies were separated. "This is all your
fault!" Tatl yelled at Link. "Open that door!" she commanded. Link complied,
and the two of them began their quest. Tatl agreed to follow Link, at least
until she met up with her brother again. Link used his deku powers to fly with
pink flowers until he reached a strange area. A waterwheel was turning some
large gears which seemed to be part of a large clock. Climbing up higher, Link
met the Happy Mask salesman. The salesman struck a deal with Link: once Link
recovered the Ocarina and the Majora's Mask that the Skull Kid had stolen, he
would teach Link how to become human again.
   As Link stepped out of the clock, a whole new world filled his eyes. Clock
Town, the center of Termina, was where he now stood. Everyone in the town
looked oddly familiar, but none of them recognized him. Even stranger were the
rumors that the moon was falling, and that it would hit in only three days....

- LOST WOODS -
NEW ITEM: DEKU NUTS

Once you reach the part where you're a scrub and you can move around, follow
the Skull Kid through the door, then use the pink flowers by pressing AND
HOLDING the A button to burrow. Aim with the control stick, then release A to
fly through the air using the pink flowers. They have a limited time, though.
Use the control stick to move forward, and A to drop down. Use this technique
to reach the Deku Nuts in the next room, then fly over to the next door. Inside
is the Clock. Up above, talk to the Happy Mask salesman. He can return you to
your original form once you recover the Ocarina of Time and the Majora's Mask.
Leave the clock to find yourself in the heart of Termina: Clock Town.

- GREAT FAIRY -
NEW UPGRADE: MAGIC

The Great Fairy is in Northern Clock Town, so take the path behind the clock to
reach her. She'll ask you to find her missing piece, so find it in town. During
the day, the piece will be at the Laundry Pool, and during the night, the fairy
will be hanging out in East Clock Town. Use the pink flower move to get her at
night, and the water hop to reach her during the day. Take it back to the Great
Fairy. She will now give you magic power. As a deku scrub, you can press B to
fire a bubble. Hold the B button to blow a larger bubble.

- NORTH CLOCK TOWN -

Now use a bubble to pop the Majora balloon in North Clock Town. Talk to Jim,
the Bomber leader (the little boy with the red bandana, the others have blue
bandanas), then he'll ask his buddies to hide all over town. Now you have to
find all five of them before tomorrow morning (do this in the morning to get
the most time). Two will be nearby in North Clock Town. They shouldn't be too
tough. One of them will be in West Clock Town, no trouble. The toughest two
will be in East Clock Town. One of them is on the thatched roof next to the
Inn. Use the pink flower to chase him down. The last one is holding onto a
cucco on another roof (use the stairs). He'll also jump down as soon as he sees
you. Once you catch the fifth Bomber, they'll all gather with you at North
Clock Town. They'll give you their secret password (I'm pretty sure it's dif-
ferent in each game), so write it down so you don't forget. Unfortunately,
you're just a little deku scrub, so they won't accept you into their club. Use
the password to get past the Bomber with a yellow bandana in East Clock Town.
The Bombers' Secret Society of Justice forever!!!

- EAST CLOCK TOWN -
NEW TRADE ITEM: MOON'S TEAR (becomes LAND TITLE DEED)
NEW TRADE ITEM: LAND TITLE DEED (becomes SWAMP TITLE DEED)

Follow the passage down to the water. As a deku scrub, you can hop on the water
five times in a row, but you can't swim. If you try to hop more than five times 
you'll return to where you first jumped onto the water. Hop along the stone
platforms until you reach the skulltulla. Use a bubble against him when he
turns around, then continue down the passageway. Use another bubble against the
balloon. Follow the hallway to the observatory. For now, ignore the scarecrow.
Climb the stairs to meet Professor Shikashi. Talk to him and look through his
telescope. You can look at anything in Termina Field, but the important thing
is the Skull Kid, dancing atop the Clock Tower. Press the A button to zoom in
on the clock tower. The camera should center on the Skull Kid, then the moon
will shed a single tear. Now you can go outside the observatory (take the upper
door) and take the Moon's Tear. Take it back to South Clock Town and visit the
Deku scrub with the flower. Trade him your Moon's Tear for a Land Title. Now
you can use the flower (note: these kind of trading items can't be saved).

- SOUTH CLOCK TOWN -
NEW ITEM: OCARINA OF TIME
NEW SONG: SONG OF TIME

Use the flower to reach the upper door of the Clock Tower. If it's earlier than
Night of the third day, you finished early! Take some time to explore town and
get used to everything. Talk to people and explore. Get to know the town. Once
you reach Night of the Third Day, it's time to go back to the tower. The door
will only open at Midnight of the Third Day. Once it opens, go inside and
you'll automatically go up to the top. Watch the cinematic, then shoot the
Skull Kid with a bubble. He'll drop the Ocarina of Time. Grab it, then re-
member... Princess Zelda... the Song of Time... hey! Snap out of it! This is no
time for memories! What can you do with a stupid old instrument? Well, you
might as well try something. Set it to a C button, then try using it. Hey!
Where did those big pipes come from?! Play the Song of Time to save your game
and return to Dawn of the First Day. Why would you want to do this? Otherwise
the moon would fall right on top of your little wooden head. Bye bye, Clock
Town! We don't want that to happen, do we? Get used to the fact that you lose
some items (not the important ones) and that people don't recognize you.

- INSIDE THE CLOCK TOWER -
NEW SONG: SONG OF HEALING
NEW SONG: INVERTED SONG OF TIME
NEW SONG: SONG OF DOUBLE TIME
NEW MASK: DEKU MASK

Go inside the Clock Tower (lower door this time) and meet up with the Happy
Mask salesman. He'll teach you the Song of Healing, then he'll ask for the
Majora's Mask... you didn't get it... oops. Too bad, Mr. Happy Mask Salesman.
He'll go off complaining about how important it is and why it's so evil. Now
that you're back to your human (hylian?) self again, you can use all sorts of
cool stuff. Not only can you use your sword and shield, you can also use the
Deku Mask (from the salesman) to transform into a deku scrub again, if you need
to (you will). For now, you can either explore town or head south, though I
recommend heading south on the first day (you can explore, then use the song
of time to go back to the first day). This isn't really important, but you can
visit the scarecrow in the Astral Observatory to hear about the two songs that
manipulate time (you don't officially learn them, but they work). The two songs
are the Inverted Song of Time (very useful) and the Song of Double Time. Play
the Song of Time backwards (Inverted) to slow down time, and play the Song of
Time pressing each button twice in a row (double) to warp ahead to the next
morning or night.

- GET THE BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK -
NEW ITEM: BOMBERS' NOTEBOOK

I almost forgot this! This is extremely important. As Link, do the whole Bomber
hunt again, but this time, you'll be accepted into their club (make sure you're
human). They'll give you a Bombers' Notebook. The Bombers are a gang of kids
devoted to solving people's problems (doesn't sound like a typical gang). Each
time you meet someone, they'll be entered into your notebook (unless they're
really minor and they have no problems that you can solve). Their whole
schedule is entered, so use this to help them solve their problems. There are
twenty characters who have problems that you can solve. NOTE: When you use the
Song of Time, their problems will return, but if you've solved them, that info
will be saved in the notebook. To use the notebook, go to the STATUS screen,
choose it, then press the A button. Oh yeah, and, um, ... The Bombers' Secret
Society of Justice Forever!

Also, an alternate way of getting the Bombers' Notebook is to use the password
to enter the hideout as a human. When you leave, Jim will show up and ask you
to join the club.

-*- SOUTHERN SWAMP -*-
NEW ITEM: PICTOGRAPH BOX

From South Clock Town, take the southern entrance to town (guarded by a guard).
With your sword showing, he'll let you out. Head south through Termina Field
(YES!!! THE ZELDA THEME MUSIC!!!) until you reach a tree with a sketch on it.
Now it's Tatl's turn to get lost in memories. She'll give you some background
information on the Skull Kid. Once she'd done, follow the trail behind the tree
towards the swamp. Ignore the pink flowers for now. Once you reach the swamp,
climb up the ladder to the house and talk to the guy. Want to go for a boat
ride? You can't. Koume is missing. Her sister, Kotake lives in the teapot-house
a little ways away. Visit her, then enter the woods behind her house.

- WOODS OF MYSTERY -
NEW ITEM: BOTTLE #1

Remind you of anything? Same music too, except this time, the little monkey
will guide you through the woods. And remember, if you go through the wrong
tunnel, you have to start over from the beginning. Once you reach the last
room, you'll find Koume. She was attacked by the Skull Kid, so return to the
Teapot House to tell Kotake. She'll give you a free red potion to take to
Koume, and she'll even let you keep the bottle. Take the potion to Koume and 
give it to her, though this is the toughest part of the whole darned game. This
took me five or six tries. Seriously! Every time you try to give the potion to
Koume, you just drink it yourself! Don't worry if this happens, you can get
another free one at the Teapot. To actually give it to her, all you need to do
is wait until she says "Press START and set it to a C button, then use the C
button to give it to me." While this message is still displayed, set the bottle
to a C button if you haven't already, then press the C button WHILE THE MESSAGE
IS STILL DISPLAYED! Otherwise she'll just say "What good are you?" or some-
thing. Once you give it to her, she'll take the potion and drink it, then
she'll return to the swamp house. Return there, then talk to her through the
boat ride window. She'll give you free ride through the swamp. Yay. Won't this
be fun.

- DEKU PALACE -
NEW ITEM: MAGIC BEANS
NEW SONG: SONATA OF AWAKENING

Enjoy the cruise, then jump off at the first stop (don't get your feet wet,
the swamp water is poisonous, hop as a deku scrub if you need to). Transform
into a deku scrub, then get past the guards. Check in the King's Chamber
directly in front of you to find out what's going on with the monkey, then
exit. Take the door on your left (on your right when you first come in). Avoid
the guards (if they see you, they'll kick you out) until you reach an under-
ground grotto. Hop down inside, then get the free sample of beans. Plant them
and water them (fill your bottle with spring water) in the nearby dirt hole,
then hop on the platform to find twenty rupees. Use this to buy at least one
more bean. Get more water, then leave. Let a guard catch you to get outside
the palace, then hop on the water and the lily pads to the right of the palace.
You'll find another patch of dirt. Do the same thing, then use the plant to
climb up higher. Now use the pink flowers (this is tough) to jump from platform
to platform. You have to time it just right, or else it won't work. Cross the
little bridge to the other side, then do the same until you reach the last
platform. WAIT until it rises up, then jump out. Enter the tunnel and talk to
the monkey. Do whatever he says (take out your deku pipes when he asks for some
loud instrument), then let him teach you the Sonata of Awakening. Now the mon-
key's in trouble, so exit the palace and use the water hop to reach the Wood-
fall Shortcut (it's on the same path you took, if you're facing the exit, it's
a small ledge on your left).

- WOODFALL -
NEW SONG: SONG OF SOARING

Transform into Link to take care of the dragonflies (use the shield, then
attack the tail with your sword), then use the deku flower jump to fly over to
Kaepora Gaebora the owl. He will teach you the Song of Soaring (very useful,
you can fly to any owl statue you've hit with your sword, kind of like FLY in
PokÈmon). Now enter the door next to the waterfall (if you fall down, I think
there's a vine wall you can climb). In the next area, stun the Hiploops with
a bubble (don't fall into the poison water). Get over to the rock platform with
the deku symbol on it and an owl statue. Hit the statue, then play the Sonata
of Awakening to make the Woodfall Temple rise out of the swamp. Break open the
middle pot and use your bottle to catch the fairy (if you die, your energy will
automatically be refilled). Now use the deku flower hop to reach the temple
(you will barely be able to make it, so keep pushing Up on the control stick).

In the start room, use the Deku Scrub to fly across. If you need a fairy, (the
kind you can catch, not the ugly kind), just break open the pot on the first
platform. Careful, two skulltulas are hiding above the last platform. Try to
land in the middle of the platform. Now, enter room 1.1 (meaning room 1, floor
1), the central room. As a Deku Scrub, jump off the right side of the ledge,
hop the water to the corner platform, then turn left and hop to the door to
room 2.1. You can hop to the ugly plants as a scrub, but they'll eat you if you
jump on them as Link. Use them to reach the pink flower in the center of the
room (the water in this temple is poisonous). Fly to the left, to the chest
(point K on the map) to get a key. If you want to, you can use the flower to
fly to room 3.1 to get the dungeon map. Now return to room 1.1. Hop on the
plants to reach the door to room 4.1. In room 4.1, push the block out of your
way (forwards), then run to the right, then over to the lit torch. Take out the
skulltula, then push the block the other way so that you have easy access to
the door to room 5.1 which contains the compass. To unlock the door, light a
deku stick on fire from the torch by the skulltula, then carry it over to the
torch by the door. Kill the dragonflies to make the chest with the compass
appear. Back in room 4.1, light another deku stick and take it up the stairs.
Light the torch up there, then, if you need to, light another deku stick. Hop
on the platforms to reach the cobwebbed passageway. With a lit deku stick, hit
the deku stick button again to hit the cobwebs with the flaming stick. The webs
will burn away giving you access to the stairs leading to room 6.2. In room
6.2, light the three torches on fire with a deku stick to open the door to room
7.2 Ignore the dragonflies (unless they're close by), then use the pink flowers
to reach the staircase on the other side of the room. Take the stairs at point
"b" down to room 1.1. Hit the switch to make the ladders appear. Use these to
access the upper level easily. Enter the upper door leading to room 2.1, then
enter room 8.1 (make sure you're back into Link). Stab the Lizalfos a couple
times to win the Hero's Bow. Return to room 2.1. Shoot the eye switch with an
arrow to make the platform with the flower on it rise up. Using the flower by
the door to room 8.1, fly to the center platform, then fly to the door to room
9.1 (how many prepositions can I use in one sentence?) The bright orange
Gekko is guarding the big key. Once he starts riding the snapper turtle, turn
into a deku scrub and burrow into a flower. Wait until the snapper is about to
run over the flower, then pop out. Quickly transform back into Link and shoot
the Gekko. Repeat this strategy until he becomes a harmless singing frog. Take
the big key and return to room 1.1. Nearby should be a torch. Stand between it
and the big flower in the center. Shoot an arrow through the torch so that it
catches on fire, hits the brazier in the middle, and lights it on fire. Now the
big flower will rise up and begin spinning. Don't jump on yet. Return to the
lower level, then swim across to the ramp. Climb up, then hop on to the spin-
ning platform. Shoot an arrow through the flame in the middle so that it hits
the torch on the ledge. This will open the door to room 10.1. In room 10.1,
there are two pillars. On the right one is a deku flower, and nearby should be
a crystal switch. Shoot the switch with an arrow, then fly to the now exting-
uished deku flower (the flames will return, so don't take your time), then fly
up to the nearby platform with another deku flower. Use this deku flower to
reach the door to Odowla.

- MASKED JUNGLE WARRIOR ODOWLA -
NEW SONG: OATH TO ORDER

Pretty easy. Just hurt him in any way you can. Your sword works the best, so
use your shield, then run in and slash him. He seems to like to dance more than
fight, but he does have one huge sword. A great strategy once Odowla sends in
the little bugs is to grab a Bomb flower. The bugs will be attracted by the
light. Place the Bomb next to Odowla if you can. When the Bomb goes off, all
the bugs will die! If Odowla happens to be nearby, he'll also take some major
damage. Get the hearts and such that the bugs leave behind. It's also a good
idea to catch a fairy in a bottle. If you die (you likely will), the fairy will
refill your energy automatically (note: the fairy must be a red one, shaped
like Tatl, not an ugly dungeon fairy with wings on it's head). One final note:
the Bow may seem like it would work well, but since Odowla is dancing all over
the place, it may be a bit tough to hit him, even with Z Targeting, since the
arrows will usually just hit his gigantic shield. As a scrub, you can also use
the burrow-and-pop strategy, but it's tough to hit Odowla. The sword is pro-
bably the best. Once you hit him enough times, he'll turn into a mask. Take it
and watch the cool story scene....

- AFTER ODOWLA -
NEW MASK: MASK OF SCENTS

You will now find the Deku Princess (slash the vines), and she'll explain some
stuff, then she asks you to find something to carry her in back to the palace
(what is it with princess that can't walk on their own?). Got an empty jar?
Sure, she'll fit. It's a tight squeeze, though! Hurry back to the palace, then
plop her out in front of the king before the monkey becomes stew. Yay! The
monkey is saved! The king is so thankful, he'll give you a reward, though you
have to find it. If you played the original Ocarina of Time, you'll know what
to do when you get there. It's in a cave on the left side of the palace (right
side as you exit). Instead of DampÈ leading you through a twisting maze, it's
the butler this time. Keep up with him, and don't touch the fire as a scrub, or
else you're toast. You can transform into Link for the jumping parts and the
fire maze. It's a lot tougher this time. Your prize is the Mask of Scents. The
Butler also mentions something about who you resemble... Remember that sad-
looking tree at the beginning of the game before you entered Termina?....

-*- MOUNTAIN VILLAGE -*-
NEW ITEM: LENS OF TRUTH
NEW MASK: GORON MASK
NEW SONG: LULLABY INTRO

Your next destination is Snowhead Temple, located near the Mountain Village. To
get there, head north from Clock Town. Use an arrow to drop the small ice
chunk onto the large ice blocks. TIP: Fight the dodongo's for easy rupees! Jump
attack their tail while they breath fire, shield up, then repeat. Take the
trail up to the mountain village, then take the trail behind the smithy's shop.
Buy the map from tingle if you want (pop his baloon with an arrow, the map here
is cheap). Continue on to find the Goron Village. Talk to the Goron up above
the door and ask him to open the door. Enter the shrine. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!WAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That baby sure has lungs.... Climb up to the top floor (plug your ears), then
enter the upper room and talk to the Baby Goron. He'll tell you that his dad
left and then he'll continue to cry like the moon is falling. Go back outside
and go east to the cliffs. Talk to Kaepora Gaebora and follow his feathers
(jump onto them, there are hidden platforms underneath them). Get the Lens of
Truth from the cave, then use that to return. Look above the little shadow to
meet the ghost of Darmani, the Goron warrior. Follow him back to the mountain
village. Use the Deku Scrub's water hop to reach the cliffs with the hidden
rungs. Climb them to find Darmani's grave. Get the Goron mask (you have to play
the Song of Healing for the ghost of Darmani), then fill your bottle with hot
spring water by moving Darmani's grave. Hurry to the middle area (with the
white wolfos), and break open all of the large white snowballs in the lower
area until you find the Goron Elder. Learn the Lullaby Intro, then return to
the Goron Village. Make sure you've already talked to the baby before talking
to the elder. Otherwise, the elder won't know that his baby is cold and is
crying his eyes (and lungs) out.

- GORON VILLAGE -
NEW SONG: GORON LULLABY

Transform into Darmani, then press and hold A, then tap B to pound the ground.
Use this to open up the door to the Goron Shrine. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's a good thing you know that Lullaby, or at least the first part. Run up to
the upper room, then play the Lullaby Intro to calm the baby goron, son of the
Elder. He'll teach you the whole lullaby. Now head to Snowhead.

- SNOWHEAD -

Use Darmani's roll move to jump the ramps (make sure you have spikes coming
out of your body or it won't work). I'll be referring to Goron Link as Darmani,
so get used to it. Once you reach Snowhead, play the Goron Lullaby to put the
giant Goron to sleep (you can only see him with the Lens of Truth). Goodbye!
WHUMP! Don't worry, he's big, the fall didn't hurt him. Now climb up the path
to Snowhead Temple.

-*- SNOWHEAD TEMPLE -*-
NEW ITEM: FIRE ARROW

Snowhead can be confusing, especially if you're trying to write a walkthrough
for it. But that's nothing compared to drawing a map using / \ _ and |. I'll do
my best, but this will probably confuse you. If this map and walkthrough seem
too confusing, try printing them out so that you can look at the map and read
the walkthrough at the same time. Also, forgive the crudity of the map, it's
not to scale and it's not color ("It's fine, Doc," ... sorry, semi-inside
joke). The map is mostly for numbering each room so you know where to go. One
last note, when referring to rooms in the walkthrough, I'll usually say some-
thing like "room 3.1." This means room 3, level 1. I'll do this for all the
rooms, but it's mostly so you know what level I'm talking about.

In the first room, knock out the icicles with your sword, then use Darmani to
push the block out of the way. Ignore the White Wolfos and go to the right,
into room 1.1. Use Darmani to jump the ramp, then crash into the crate to stop
yourself. If you do fall down, you can use Darmani to walk across the lava to
the ladder. Climb the stairs at point "a" to get to room 2.2. Use your shield
to block the Bombchu (bounce it off your shield and it'll explode). Take the
map, then return to room 1.1 via the point "a" stairs. Enter room 3.1 through
the door to your right.

Cross room 3.1 and enter room 4.1 to find a key. It's hidden behind two blocks
to your left. Take the key and exit room 4.1. Aim your Bow so that it points
towards the ice blocking the START room, and shoot the arrow THROUGH THE TORCH
to melt the ice. Enter the START room, then use the key to get into room 5.1.
Get the compass and ignore the rest, trust me, it's easier to get the fairies
once you have the hookshot. Take the stairs at point "b" to reach room 6.2.

Use the same strategy you used on the ice blocking the path to the mountain
village (shoot the large ice blocks on the ceiling). Use Darmani to turn the
giant snowball into powder to reveal a small key. Use it to enter room 7.2.
This is one of the more frustrating rooms, and you have to be quick. Here's a
map of it:

    ____..___
 .,/    5o   \
|      4o o3  \
 \       2o   /
  \ 1o       /
   ØØØØØØØØØØ
You'll have to switch between Link and Darmani to jump and pound the switches
respectively. First, pound the switch at 1o to make 2o and 5o rise. Use Link to
jump to switch 2o, then use Darmani to pound o3. Pound switch 2o, then use Link
to quickly climb onto 4o and then jump to the door. Now you should be in room
3.2. Use Darmani to jump the ramp, roll across the snow, then jump the other
ramp to get to room 8.2 (you wouldn't believe how long this took me to figure
out). Fight the Wizrobe in 8.2 to win the Fire Arrow. To fight him, shoot him
with an arrow when he becomes solid. It's easy to tell where the real one is:
just look at your compass. A red dot shows where he'll pop up next. Once he's
gone, take the Fire Arrow. Now you can melt all the ice blocking the doors!

The first door to go should be the one leading to room 9.1, either one is fine.
Inside, use the Fire Arrow or your sword to kill all the Freezards. Once
they're all out of the way, light all three torches on fire with the Fire Arrow
to open the door. Enter the middle door and use Darmani to pound the switch.
The giant central pillar will rise all the way up to the top. Now return to
room 9.1 and go to the left. Take the door to room 3.1, then go to room 1.1
through the START room. In room 1.1, shoot all the Freezards, then melt the ice
block to reach a small key in a chest. Take the stairs up to room 2.2.

Take care of the Bombchu, then hop onto the center platform. From there, shoot
the freezard with a Fire Arrow and then shoot the frozen eye switch. The plat-
form will rise. Hop off, then take the door to room 3.2. Jump down onto the
netting, climb the ladder, and shoot the ice with the Fire Arrow. Take the
stairs up to room 3.3. Roll across the snow and use the small key to reach room
10.3. Shoot the Eenos with a Fire Arrow, or use the Goron Pound or something.
Melt the ice and continue up the stairs. Kill the two Dinolfos in room 11.4,
then enter room 3.4. Cross the central pillar to reach room 12.4, a rematch
with the Wizrobe. Fight him the same way, then take the other door to get the
big key. Now return to 3.2 (jump down to the netting) and punch the blue ice
blocks out of the central pillar (as Darmani). Climb the stairs and do the same
in 3.3. Return to 3.4 and jump down onto the central pillar. Bust the snowballs
blocking the "e" staircase and enter it. Now you should be on the very highest
level. Get a good rolling start and jump the gap to reach the door to Ghot.

- MASKED MECHANICAL MONSTER GHOT -

Ghot is pretty easy. Transform into Darmani, then keep on rollin' rollin'
rollin'. Make sure you only attack him when your spikes are out. To refill on
Magic, just roll through a green jar. When Ghot stumbles, don't stop! Keep it
up until he really dies! Trust me, you'll know when he dies. If he just falls
down, that's really an invitation to hit him more! A longer but easier way of
doing it is to stand in the doorway and shoot Fire Arrows as he runs by.

Just to let you know, every time you hit him, he'll attempt to retaliate by
sending a bolt of lightning at you. Try to dodge it, it really sucks to get hit
in the middle of a Goron roll. He also causes an endless number of stalagtites
to fall from the ceiling, and also throws Bombs at you during the second half
of the battle.

- AFTER GHOT - 
NEW ITEM: BOTTLE #2

Return to the Goron Village. The cave that was blocked with ice is now thawed.
Enter to receive a Goron Powder Keg, an extremely explosive bomb only used by
gorons. Throw it up to the next ledge, then roll up to it and repeat. Take it
to the Goron Racetrack (just above Goron Pond). Use it to open up the track.
Enter the race and win to get something nice (see SIDE MISSIONS section for
details).

- ROMANI RANCH -
NEW RIDE: EPONA
NEW SONG: EPONA'S SONG
NEW ITEM: BOTTLE #3
NEW MASK: ROMANI'S MASK

Now I recommend playing the Song of Time (you can only get Epona on day one).
Return to the Clock Town Bomb Shop to buy another Powder Keg (Darmani only).
Take it to the Milk Road just south of Clock Town. Use the keg to blast away
the boulder blocking the road (don't worry, the guy will run out of the way).
Now you can reach Romani Ranch. If you want to, you can make a promise to
Romani to protect her and the cows at 2:30 AM, but only on the first day.
You'll also get Epona back (to call her after using the Song of Time, just play
Epona's Song). You can use her to practice your archery skills while riding a
horse. If you don't care about protecting the poor cows from "Them," then you
can go to the Great Bay if you want. If you do save the farm from "Them,"
you'll win a bottle of milk. Return there the next night to find Cremia,
Romani's older sister (if Cremia is in your notebook, you'll be able to see
what time she'll be there). Talk to her to hitch a ride to Termina Field. On
the way there, you'll have to pass through the Gorman Track. With your arrows,
shoot off the "bandits," then take the Romani's Mask from Cremia. If you happen
to have the Circus Leader's Mask, wear it to prevent the brothers from attack-
ing! Of course, you need the Romani's Mask to get the Circus Leader's Mask, so
it's kind of a catch 22 situation.

- STONE MASK -
NEW MASK: STONE MASK

Before you head to Great Bay, take Epona East of Clock Town, taking along a red
potion as well. Hop over the fence with Epona, then use the Lens of Truth on
the small circle of stones to find Shiro, the mysterious invisible soldier.
Give him the red potion to receive the Stone Mask. Now, before going to Great
Bay, make SURE you have at least three bottles. You almost definitely need
them. It's possible with two, but time consuming. Definitely don't try this if
you only have one bottle.

-*- GREAT BAY -*-
NEW MASK: ZORA MASK

To reach Great Bay, hop on Epona to jump the fence. Swim out to where the
seagulls are flying to find Mikau. Grab onto him from behind, then push him to
shore. With his last breath, he'll sing a song for you, then he'll leave you
the Zora Mask. With this, you can transform into Mikau. Now head to Zora Hall.

- ZORA CAPE -

You aren't required to go to Zora Hall first, but it helps you understand
what's going on a bit more. To get to Zora Cape, enter the cave on shore, west
of the Fisherman's house. Enter the tunnel to reach Zora Cape, then swim under-
water to find Zora Hall. Inside, you'll find the Zoras, who all mistake you for
 Mikau (actually, you ARE Mikau AND Link). Talk to everyone, especially Evan,
to find out about the missing eggs. Now, head back to the northern beach. Stop
by the Fisherman's House and talk to the Golden Sea Horse. The Fisherman wants
a picture of a Gerudo Pirate, so turn into Mikau to swim underwater. Go north
to reach the Pirates' Fortress.

- PIRATES' FORTRESS -
NEW ITEM: HOOKSHOT

To enter, hit the skull-and-crossbone doors underwater by swimming into them
(press and hold the A button to swim really fast). Turn back into Link and put
on the Stone Mask to prevent the guards from seeing you. Swim north to the
ramp, then transform into Darmani and hit the switch to open the underwater
gate. Transform into Mikau to swim inside (make sure the pirates don't see
you). Break down the barriers and pull the first block out towards you. Swim to
the second block and push it forward. Swim around to the upward current. Swim
past the strong current; if you get caught in it, you'll be taken back outside.
Break down the barrels, hit the switch, then hurry down the ramp to the door to
find a Piece of Heart. Now, hit the switch with an arrow (or Mikau's fins) to
open the gate. Continue past the other current to the next room. Step on the
switch, run to the geyser platform, then quickly hit the nearby crystal switch
to activate the geyser (the door to the switch closes if you don't shoot the
switch quickly enough, just hit the button again). Look through the telescope
to get a glimpse of the inner fortress, then hit the mines with your fins or
arrows. Once they hit each other, they'll both explode. Now shoot the switch on
the other side of them and exit through the door down below. You'll now be in
the inner fortress. Put on the Stone Mask to make sure the guards don't see
you. You can also shoot them with arrows to knock them out, but only for about
10 seconds. Stand right in front of one of the guards and take a close-up
pictograph. Climb the guard tower, cross the bridge, then enter the door behind
the statue first. Look in the window to eavesdrop on the conversation, then
fire an arrow at the beehive (if you're out of arrows, there are a few pots at
the end of the hallway). The bees will escape and chase out the pirates. Exit
the hallway, then enter the lower door to find the hookshot. Use this to latch
onto wood and the little targets. Explore the whole fortress to find the four
Zora eggs. Put one each in a bottle (if you don't have four bottles, rescue as
many as you can and return them to the tank back at the lab). The first one is
in the room with the hookshot, then the rest can be found by exploring the rest
of the inner fortress. Once you fill up your bottles, all four or not, return
to the lab in the bay (the one with the big tank and the crazy professor and
the giant hook on the roof). Okay, this is another one of those toughest-
things-in-the-whole-darned-game-that-shouldn't-be-this-tough. Climb the ladder,
then stand in the CENTER of the bars (or right next to the center) so that when
you drop the egg into the water, it will fall right in the center. Otherwise,
it will just say "It looks like this item doesn't work here." Once you get all
four eggs in the tank, go to the Fisherman's House back on shore.

- PINNACLE ROCK -

I better warn you.... You really should only go to Pinnacle Rock if you have at
least three bottles, it'll make life a lot easier for you. You should also have
either the magic upgrade from the Snowhead Great Fairy or a green potion or two
(you'll need a lot of magic, just get as much as you can).

Show the pictograph to the Fisherman to get the Golden Seahorse in a bottle.
Take it to pinnacle rock (west of the Pirates' Fortress) as Mikau, then release
it into the water (dive down to the ocean floor, then release). Follow it to
Pinnacle Rock. Kill all seven eels by using the electric shield as Mikau (press
AND HOLD the R Button as Mikau underwater), rescue the three other eggs, and
reunite the two Golden Seahorses. Take the eggs back to the lab. Once all seven
are in the tank, they'll hatch. They seem to be in a certain formation, so take
out your guitar and learn the New Wave Bossa Nova from them. Now return to Zora
Hall. Take the back exit to find Lulu. Play the New Wave Bossa Nova for her to
wake up the nearby turtle island. Hookshot yourself onto his back to be trans-
ported to the Great Bay Temple.

Forgive the crudity of the maps, they aren't to scale, and they look horrible.
They're only to number each room for reference in the walkthrough. This is my
favorite temple from all the Zelda games combined, so I know quite a lot about
it. It's similar to the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time, except you have to
transform into Mikau to go underwater instead of putting on the Iron Boots.
There are also several switches that change the flow of water through pipes
that eventually activate water geysers that you can step on. You also have to
change the water flow half way through the temple so that you can use the water
current to travel through new tunnels and reach new rooms.

Obviously, you start out in the START room. If you need to leave, use the Hook-
shot on the turtle's palm tree (that's what that messed up thing in the START
room is). Anyway, enter the next room. This temple may seem big and complicated
but it's also the funnest. You'll spend most of the time as Mikau, so only turn
back into Link when necessary. Note that the yellow geyser is running the large
waterwheel. The main goal of the temple is to get the water pressure flowing
into the red pipe. Your first job is to reach room 2. To do this, you need to
turn the green switch underwater. Once the switch is turned, a new geyser will
activate. Take the elevator (when facing the entrance, take the left one), then
jump to the platform to the right of the door. Be careful, the skulltula could
knock you off. Wait for the geyser to lower, then jump onto it. Let it rise,
then jump off. Enter Room 2. This is an important room. The waterwheel in room
1 is turning the gears, creating a strong spiraling current in room 2. Dive
down and enter the upper tunnel that leads to room 3 (if you find that it's too
hard to enter the tunnel, it must be the wrong one. Right now the current is
going counter-clockwise, which should push you through the right tunnel). Pick
up the Map, then take the tunnel to room 4 (the tunnel with the Dexihands).
Enter the door to reach room 5. Shoot the Bombchu with an arrow (if you use the
Hookshot, it will do more harm than good). Hop on the lily pads to reach the
compass. Now dive down to find the small key. Take the current tunnel back to
room 2 and dive down to the bottom. Enter the lower tunnel to reach room 6.
Rise up, then walk on the red pipe to reach room 7 (shoot the Bombchu with an
arrow first). Stock up on stuff before the mini-boss Wart. To fight Wart, first
use your hookshot to pull the small eyeballs, kill them with your sword, then
repeat. Once enough of them are gone, shoot Wart when the eye opens. Eventually
all the eyes will jump off and Wart will start rolling around the room. Kill
all the smaller eyes first with a few spin-attacks, then wait in the corner and
shoot Wart in the eye when he faces you (if you have the Spin Attack upgrade
from the Woodfall Fairy, use that when he's nearby). Once he's gone, open the
chest to receive the Ice Arrow.

Now that you have the Ice Arrow, there are tons of things you can do. First,
return to room six and use the Ice Arrow to freeze the octorok. Jump onto it,
and from the octorok, jump to the red pump. Now return to room 2. Freeze the
waterfall to enter room 9. Use the Hookshot to reach the yellow pump (take care
of the tektites first). From the yellow pump, shoot the Ice Arrow at the water
between you and the green pump to make a little stepping stone. Jump on and
make another one. Do it quickly, since the ice will melt soon. Use the stepping
stones (ice cubes) to reach the green pump and turn it on. Now return to room
3 and use the same strategy to reach the door to room 10. In there, use the Ice
Arrow on the Chuchu and push it to the red switch. Push it, then head to room
5. Use the stepping stones to reach room 11. Another mini-boss? Hit the Gekko
with your sword or arrows, then freeze the big blob on the ceiling with an Ice
Arrow before it falls on top of you. Shoot the Gekko again or hit it with your
sword. Once it's gone, exit through the second door to reach the Big Key.

From the Big Key room, use your hookshot to escape, then return to room 1. To
the right is a geyser coming out of the red pipe. Use the Hookshot on the tar-
get above to fall onto the geyser, then jump to the red switch. It will acti-
vate the red geyser beneath the waterwheel and stop the wheel altogether. Now
the current in room 2 is stopped! The downside? The elevators are stopped too,
so you can't get to room 2! You'll have to deactivate the yellow geyser by
turning the yellow switch off. Now the waterwheel will start turning the oppo-
site direction which will reverse the current in room 2. The elevators are
working again, so go back to room 2. Dive down then go to room 12 via the old
exit to room 5. Beware of the Dexihands on the way. In room 12, get onto the
elevator, then freeze the waterfall once it reaches the top. Jump down onto the
machinery and make your way over to the upper door. Now in room 13, you'll have
to control the seesaws by freezing and unfreezing the waterfalls. The goal in
this room is to turn the green switch, then exit the room through the other
door, which leads to the inaccessible passageway in room 3. Now that the green
water is flowing, return to room 2 and sink to the bottom. Enter the tunnel to
reach room 14. Now climb onto the green pipes and turn the last green switch to
activate the green geyser. Jump onto it, let it rise, then jump off of it to
reach the door to Gyorg. Enter the room and jump down the hole....

- GARGANTUAN MASKED FISH GYORG -

Make sure you have as many red fairies as you can cram into those bottles,
because you will be taking some heavy damage. As Mikau, swim around and use the
electric shield to attack Gyorg's head. This is dangerous, since Gyorg's mouth
is on his head. He loves to chomp on you, so be careful. If you run out of
magic, swim to a green jar in the corner and break it open. Hit Gyorg enough
times to turn him into a mask.

Another strategy that I haven't tried yet but several people have told me about
is to stand on the platform as Link or Mikau and shoot Gyorg with arrows or the
boomerang fins. When he's stunned, jump in the water as Mikau, then use the
electric shield to attack him.

- AFTER GYORG -
NEW ITEM: BOTTLE #4
NEW MASK: GARO'S MASK

Return to Zora hall to practice with the Indigo-gos. No logical purpose, it's
just cool to hear them play. See the BOTTLES section to find out how to win a
bottle from the beavers on top of the waterfall. Also, see the PIECES OF HEART
section to find out how to win a Piece of Heart from the fisherman out in Great
Bay. Before you go to Ikana Canyon, visit the Gorman Track and beat the bro-
thers in a horse race to win the Garo's Mask. It's quite tough, but as always,
it's possible.

-*- IKANA CANYON -*-
NEW MASK: CAPTAIN'S HAT
NEW SONG: SONG OF STORMS
NEW ITEM: BOTTLE #5

Before heading up the canyon, take a left and visit the Ikana Graveyard. Play
the Sonata of Awakening for Captain Keeta. Before he runs too far, shoot him
with your Bow, but wait in between each shot until he recovers. If he disap-
pears around a corner, you'll have to beat the two stalchildren to get rid of
the flame (use the quick spin attack if you know how). Once the music changes,
go up to him and attack him with your sword. If he mysteriously disappears,
look under you to see if there's a large shadow. If there is, run away a few
feet and wait for him to land. Once you defeat him, you'll be warped to the
ledge near the beginning. Listen to him, let him turn off the flame, then use
the Hookshot to reach the chest. Open it to add the Captain's Hat to your col-
lection. Use it at night (first day only) to talk to the Stalchildren. Order
them to open the grave, then enter. Jump across to the doorway. I will warn you
that the next room is swarming with Keese. You should probably use the Stone
Mask and either the hookshot or Bow. Light the three torches and continue until
you reach the Iron Knuckle. In this game, he seems a little easier, but maybe
that's because I've had so much practice fighting him in Ocarina of Time. Use
the defensive maneuvers such as the Back Flip and Side Jump to dodge his big
whopping axe, then jump attack him whenever his axe gets stuck in the floor.
Once he's gone, talk to the Flat Brother Ghost and learn the Song of Storms
from him. On night 2, you can use the Lens of Truth in the other grave to find
a Piece of Heart. On night three you can win a bottle. Once you know the Song
of Storms, you can continue up Ikana Canyon.

- IKANA CANYON -
NEW MASK: GIBDO'S MASK

To get past the guy on the cliff, show him Garo's Mask. Use the Hookshot on the
tree to climb up higher. Continue using this technique, freezing the octoroks
with the Ice Arrow (freeze the second one, then the first). Once you reach the
top, hit the Owl Statue and go up to the cave at the top. Play the Song of
Storms for the Sharp Ghost to restore the river. Now you can enter the water-
wheel house (only while Pamela is outside). If Pamela runs inside, place a Bomb
on her doorstep, then run around the southern corner and hide. Wait a few
seconds, then enter the house. Go downstairs, open the cabinet, then play the
Song of Healing quickly before Pamela returns (once you find her dad in the
cabinet, she'll run back inside). Pamela's Dad will become human again and his
gibdo body will turn into the Gibdo Mask. Now you can talk to the Gibdos in the
well. 

- BENEATH THE WELL -
NEW WEAPON: MIRROR SHIELD

Before you go down the well, you should buy the map from Tingle. It will help
you navigate the well a lot easier. Just shoot him down and buy the map.

There are a couple of ways to do this. You can do this the quick and easy way,
or the longer, confusing, and cheap way. For the quick way, you'll need to buy
(and catch) several items before going down the well, but you need to know
where to find a fish (they usually hang out in grottos). For the longer way,
you don't need to catch a fish prior to going down. Here's what you'll need be-
fore heading down the well:

QUICK WAY
When you enter the well, first go right (wear the Gibdo Mask) and give the 5
Magic Beans to the Gibdo at point a. Continue to point b and give 10 Deku Nuts
to the Gibdo. Go to point c and give the Gibdo 10 Bombs. Inside, kill the Big
Poe by shooting him with arrows after letting him bounce off your shield. Catch
him in a bottle, then go to point d and give your fish to the Gibdo. At point
e, give the Gibdo the Big Poe Spirit, then continue to point f and give the
Gibdo your milk. Continue to the final room, shoot the torches, then open the
chest to receive the Mirror Shield. Shine the light on the sun block to get to
the Ancient Castle of Ikana.

LONG WAY
First, give 5 Magic Beans to the Gibdo on the right. Continue and give 10 Deku
Nuts to the Gibdo at point b. Return to the first room and give the Blue Potion
to the Gibdo at point g. Turn left and catch a fish and also put some fresh
water into a bottle if you want 50 rupees. Give the fish to the Gibdo at point
h, then if you want the rupees, give the Spring Water to the Gibdo at point i,
then catch a bug and give it to the Gibdo at point j. Inside is a hidden chest,
use the Lens of Truth to see it. If you need any fairies, you can give another
bug to the Gibdo at point k (I don't recommend it, you'll need the bottle
space). Back at point h, continue through the door and turn left to catch
another fish. Kill the Dexihand and bottle some Hot Spring Water. Quickly run
back to point l on the map and give the Hot Spring Water to the Gibdo to get
into the room with the cow. Once you've given him the water, run back to point
d and give the fish to the Gibdo to get rid of it. Run back to point l, enter
the cow room, then play Epona's Song for the cow to get some free milk. Give 10
Bombs to the Gibdo at point c, then battle the Big Poe. Put his spirit into a
bottle, then go to point e and give the Poe Spirit to the Gibdo. Go left, catch
a bug, then go back to the Gibdo at point m to get another 50 rupees. Go to the
final Gibdo at point f and give him your milk. Continue down the corridor to
reach the final room. Light the torches with the Fire Arrow to get the Mirror
Shield. Personally, I think the mirror shield is ugly, I like the Hero's Shield
better! If you've played through Ocarina of Time, you know how this works. If
not, use the mirror shield to reflect the sunlight onto the little sun faces.
Climb the ladder and continue to reach the Ancient Castle of Ikana.

- ANCIENT CASTLE OF IKANA -
NEW SONG: ELEGY OF EMPTYNESS

Before you infiltrate the castle, first make sure you buy a powder keg! This
will save you an unnecessary trip back to town! Actually, you have to make a
trip back to town anyway to get a keg, but you should get it before you enter
the castle since you'll kick yourself if you don't get it beforehand.

This place is kinda crazy. Put on Garo's Mask and enter the castle. With the
Garo's Mask on, you'll make the ReDead dance like ballerinas. Shoot the icy
eyes on the pillars to open the doors, then open the door on the left. Hit the
switch and run quickly under the large ceiling that rises (it will fall soon,
so use the Bunny Hood to run faster). Once you reach the other side, transform
into the Deku Scrub and hit the switch by pressing A. Quickly run to the pink
flower before the ceiling falls on top of you. Once you're inside the flower,
wait for the ceiling to fall, then pop out to make the ceiling rise again.
quickly drop down and burrow into the flower, then fly up to the pillar with
the button on top. Press it as Link, shoot the crystal switch with an arrow,
then continue to the next room. Turn back into the Deku Scrub and fly to the
switch on the left. Use Link to press the switch. Now, between you and the
skulltula is an invisible platform (use the Lens of Truth). While standing on
the platform, use the Hookshot on the skulltula. Jump to the platform, then
jump to the first one. Transform into a Deku Scrub and fly to the platform on
the right. Aim for the left side of the platform since a sneaky skulltula waits
above the right side. Kill it, then use the hookshot on the hanging mines.
Start them swinging, then once they hit each other, they'll explode. Use the
flower to reach the now unlocked door. Before you enter the door, put on the
Stone Mask. Enter, then sneak past the blue bubbles. Walk up the stairs, then
climb up onto the outer wall. Pass up the tempting Piece of Heart for now, then
walk along the wall until you reach the area above the main entrance. Shoot the
two Guay, then use the deku flower to reach the switch. Hop over to the other
flower and use it to return to the wall.

NOW you can try to get the piece of heart (it's no big deal if you fall down).
To get it, shoot down the Guay, then hit the switch with the hookshot. Jump to
the first flower, transform, then use it to reach the next flower. Use that one
to reach the Piece of Heart. Now jump down to the ground and enter the castle.

Enter the right door (make sure you use the Garo mask on the ReDeads). Use the
mirror shield to kill the Floormaster and the three mini versions. Aim the
reflection on the sun block (keep the Garo Mask on!) Enter the door past the
ReDeads to have yet another rematch with Wizrobe. Beat him, then take the
stairs past the other ReDeads. Be careful on the roof, the first switch you
pressed opened up a hole in the roof to let the light in so that you could get
past the Sun Block. Don't fall down it unless you want to kill the Floormaster
and the ReDeads again. Transform into Darmani and use the Powder Keg on the
weak floor (ceiling?). Jump down and use the mirror shield on the sun block
(remember the Garo's Mask!). Enter the hall and continue to the Throne Room.
Igos du Ikana, the king, will close the drapes to darken the room. Ignore the
two huge ugly skeletons he uses to try to kill you and fire two Fire Arrows at
the two drapes. NOW start attacking the skeletons. Once one of them collapses,
run into the light and use the mirror shield to shine it on him to defeat him
for GOOD! You can also use the shield to annoy them and make them run away into
the darkness. Once the two little skeletons are taken care of, the king, Igos
du Ikana, will attack you. Use the same strategy, but this guy will remove his
head a few times and let it fly around a little while just to annoy you. Just
hit him and shine the light on him when he collapses. And if you wear the
Captain's Hat before the battle, the king will think you're a mini-version of
the captain! Anyway, once the three spirits are freed, learn the Elegy of
Emptiness from the head of the king. Use the song to create a dummy of yourself
in whatever form you're in (see the SONGS section for details).

To get into Stone Tower Temple, take the steep ramp in Ikana Valley to reach
the Stone Towers. Hop across the stones, then place an Elegy Dummy on the
switch to move one of the blocks. It may be blocked by one of the other blocks,
but don't worry. Once you place three different elegy dummies (Link, Darmani,
and Mikau) on the first three switches, all three blocks should be nicely in
place. If they aren't, try doing it again. Also, you may notice that there
seems to be only one switch... Try looking around and you should see a hookshot
target nearby. This leads to the second switch, and another nearby hookshot
target leads to the third. Once you have placed all three different dummies on
the switches (the Deku Dummy is too small), hop across the three blocks to the
other side. Ignore the three switches in a row, they're red herrings. Continue
up and place the three dummies on the next three separate switches. Once you
cross the blocks a second time, use the hookshot a couple of times to reach the
top level. First of all, hit the Owl Statue, then leave the three dummies on
the switches in this order (facing the temple):

   3
 2   1

Now you can hop across the three stone platforms to reach Stone Tower Temple.

*=PINK DEKU FLOWER

I added the Pink Flowers to this because they're kinda important. This is one
of the more confusing temples, especially since you have to flip the whole
temple half-way through. Even scarier is the fact that much of this temple has
no roof.... It's a little bit scary flying from platform to platform with the
sun and sky directly below you. You'll notice for the first half of the temple
the strategically placed platforms and walkways above you which you'll be using
later. You'll also add the final magical arrow to your quiver after battling
with the Master Garo. Also, before you enter the temple, buy some Chateau
Romani from the Milk Bar. This will allow you to use all the magic you want
until you use the Song of Time. If you don't want to bother with it, trust me,
it's worth it (it costs a load of rupees). If you don't get the Chateau Romani,
get a Blue Potion from Kotake. Trust me, it's less trouble to get the Chateau
Romani. If you really don't want to get one of these, I can almost guarantee
you will need a green potion, at least. If you don't want to wait until the
Milk Bar opens, you can always start the temple, then leave part way through to
get it.

In the START room, get rid of the enemies and enter room 1. Kill the Bombchus
by Z-Targeting, raising your shield, then bouncing them off. They'll blow up
after bouncing off. Bomb the cracked wall (tip: hit a wall with your sword to
test if it can be bombed. If it goes "THONG!" it can't be bombed. If it goes
"TWAING!" it can. It's easier to listen than to try to interpret my descrip-
tion. If you played Ocarina of Time, this may be familiar.) Roll through the
big crates, then take the two small crates and use them to weigh down two of
the switches. Use the Elegy of Emptiness to weigh down two others (if you need
to, use Darmani's dummy on the bigger switch). Now you can enter room 2. In
room 2, bomb the darker square (the one without the plants). Jump down and use
your Mirror Shield to get rid of the blue block. Use Darmani to cross the lava
and kill all the Armos Knights to make a small key in a chest appear (don't
forget the map in the chest past the blue block). Climb back up the stairs,
then use the key to enter room 4. Transform into Mikau, then hop into the
water. Let the Dexihand grab you and throw you up to a small key in a chest.
Jump back in and kill the Dexihand. Follow the tunnel to room 5. 

Rise to the top, then hop out. Turn back into Link and stand in the middle of
the sunlight. Aim your Mirror Shield towards the mirror. These mirrors collect
sunlight, then reflect it back. The longer you shine your light on it, the
longer it will shine back. Shine the sunlight on it for a good thirty seconds
or so, then run into the light it shines back ("I wanna be in the light, as you
are in the light! I wanna shine like the stars in the heavaaaaaans! Oh oh!" ...
sorry). Shine this light onto the nearby sun block to reach the compass. Now go
back to the locked door leading to room 6. Knock the blocks out of the way with
Darmani, then use the charge-up method to get rid of the two sun blocks. The
Black Boes can be really pesky here, so be sure to put on the Stone Mask so
they won't attack.

In room 7, transform into Deku Link and use the pink flower to fly around to
the next door. The air geyser things will help give you more air time, so be
sure to stop at each one and let them push you as high as you'll go. Be careful
of the Bombchu on one of the bars, if you fall in the lava, you're toast.

In room 8, you'll battle the Master Garo. He's a LOT tougher than his little
underlings, so be sure you come stocked with Bombs (the Blast Mask is also good
if you happen to have it). If you use Bombs, try to get the Master Garo to be
in a corner and get between him and the rest of the room. Throw a Bomb and
cross your fingers. If you have the blast mask, get right next to Garo and blow
yourself up (hold the R button to prevent yourself from getting hurt). The
downside to this is that it takes a minute or so for the Blast Mask to
recharge. A combination of the two is probably best. You can also freeze him
with an Ice Arrow, and then hit him with your sword, but that consumes magic
and didn't seem to work too well for me. Once he dies without leaving a corpse,
take the Light Arrow and exit the temple via room 9. In room 9, use your hook-
shot on the Hiploop to take it's mask, then shoot it again. In room 4, kill the
Eyegore by running up to it, wait until it's about to pound you, run away, then
shoot it's eye with an arrow or the hookshot when it turns yellow. Once you
reach the outside of the temple, use the Song of Soaring to reach the owl
statue on the other side, then move the three blocks out of the way. Shoot the
red jewel between the last block and the entrance to the temple with a light
arrow. WAAAH!!! You'll fall down into the sky as the whole area flips itself
upside-down. Don't worry, you'll land back on the ledge that had the owl statue
on it. Hey! Where did the owl statue go? Oh yeah, it's all upside down. Hop the
blocks and re-enter the temple. Now you have access to all those items that you
had seen on the ceiling.

The strange thing is, the temple is upside down, but the locations of the rooms
seems to be the same. Hmmm, maybe the programmers screwed up or maybe my eyes
are just confused. Anyway, enter room 5 (use the Light Arrow on the block if
necessary). Transform into a Deku Scrub and hop into the air geysers. Wow!
You'll automatically take out your pink flower things and fly! Land carefully
on the bridge with the Hiploop on it. Kill it, then run down the hall. At the
end of the hall, you can jump off and let the Dexihand grab you if you want
some rupees. Press the switch in the hall then go back to the bridge to find a 
key in a chest. Fly up to the platform. If you can, take out the mines with the
hookshot. Use the key to enter room 10. There's lava dripping down from up
above, and there's no way to cross the room this way. Shoot the red jewel with
a light arrow to flip the temple. Use Darmani to cross the lava, then flip the
temple again to enter the door to room 11.

You'll have to do more flipping in here, so kill the Green Chuchu and the
Yellow Chuchu to get more magic and arrows respectively to keep those Light
Arrows coming. Your goal is to move the block to the small hole next to the
door to room 3. You'll have to flip the room several times to get the block
past raised portions of the floor. Make sure you don't stand on top of the
block as you flip the room, or else the block will fall right on top of you and
you'll have to start over (I learned that from experience, but I just wanted to
see what happened! Honestly! I was just making sure they checked that in bug-
testing!). Anyway, just look up at the ceiling (floor?) to help you get the
block to the right place (if you can't figure this out on your own, put the
cartridge back in the box and take it back to the store, Zelda games aren't for
you). Once you get the block in place, climb onto it and jump to the door.
Enter to once again fight the Wizrobe. Use the same strategy of firing arrows
and using the compass to see where he's coming up (literally and figuratively).
Once he's out of the way, latch onto the chest that appears (with your hook-
shot) to reach the stairs down to room 2.

Kill the Poes if you need to, then use the Deku Flower to reach the other side.
Before entering the door, use the other flower (or just transform into Link and
walk on the support) to reach the tunnel off to the side leading to room 1.
Dodge the floating Armos Statues and put an Elegy Dummy on the switch to turn
off the fire around the chest with the key in it. Return to room 2, then enter
the door to room 4. Shoot one of the mines with the hookshot to make it blow up
itself and one other, leaving one left behind. Fly deku-style over to the next
flower (it's inaccurate on the map, it's right under the walkway with the Eye-
gore on it). From there, fly deku-style again to the door leading to room 12.
Technically, room 12 is really part of room 5, but you can't get to room 5 from
this passageway. Before entering, put on the Stone Mask. If you're low on ener-
gy, kill the Blue Bubbles by Z-Targeting, bouncing them off your shield, then
killing them with your sword. Be careful, if a Blue Bubble touches you when
it's flames are burning, you'll be jinxed for a minute or two (meaning you
won't be able to use your sword). Be sure you're un-jinxed and healthy before
entering the door to room 13, and stock up on magic and arrows from the nearby
crates too. A nasty monster is waiting for you behind that door.

Gomess looks mean and scary, but he's not that tough compared with some other
mini-bosses I've seen. He's a cross between the Grim Reaper and Batman. Shoot
a Light Arrow at him to disperse the bats, then run in and jump-attack him with
your sword. Dodge the scythe (your shield probably works) and repeat your
attack. Once he's out of the way, take the Big Key and return to room 12. Kill
the Blue Bubbles to get more hearts, then return to the doorway leading to room
2 from room 4, but don't go in. Instead, take the doorway leading to the START
room. This statue guy is kinda tough. Shoot him with a Light Arrow to flip him,
then use the Bunny Hood, the Zora Mask, or a prayer to jump over to his plat-
form. He should try to pound you, or something, so dodge him and let him de-
stroy himself somehow :). Hit the switch to make a treasure chest appear on the
ceiling. Hookshot yourself up to it, then let yourself drop down onto the walk-
way (it contains a fairy, but you'd need to flip the temple to reach it proper-
ly). Enter the door with the key you got from room 1, then kill the Eyegore by
running up to it. Once it's about to pound you, run away and shoot it in the
eye when it turns yellow. It'll leave behind a chest that contains the Giant's
Mask. It seems useless, but make sure you have it, you'll need it in the coming
battle.

- GIANT MASKED INSECT TWINMOLD -

This has to be the easiest final-temple boss ever! This is the only time you
will need to use the Giant's Mask, but make sure you come armed with lots of
green potions, blue potions, or just drink some Chateau Romani at the Milk Bar
to give you infinite magic until you use the Song of Time. At Twinmold, simply
use the Giant's Mask to make yourself bigger, then hit the bugs in the head or
tail with your sword. Once you kill both of them, you'll get the final mask.
Now you can stop the moon from falling....

-*- THE MOON -*-

Before climbing the Clock Tower and heading to the moon, you should stock up on
a few things. First, and probably most important, you should go to the Milk Bar
and buy some Chateau Romani. Drink it to give yourself unlimited Magic power
for the final battle and upcoming mini-dungeons. Next, max out on arrows,
Bombs, and Bombchus (if you're a really bad player, you should get a lot of
Bombchus, if you're a Bombchu expert, you won't need any). You may also want to
get a few fairies in your bottles. Finally, it will make the final boss really
easy if you take along all twenty masks (the Happy Masks, not the transforma-
tion masks). You will need to use all twenty to get the final transformation
mask....

Also, I'm going to assume you're going to use the Fierce Deity's Mask during
the final battle. The only reason you wouldn't want to is that it takes a while
to get and it makes the final boss too easy, but you should get the mask at
some point, so it's a good idea. Oh, yeah, and to get the Fierce Deity's Mask,
you'll need to have all 20 non-transformation masks (well, technically the
Giant's Mask is a transformation mask, but it's one of the 20 that you'll need
to get the Fierce Deity's Mask).

To get to the moon, all you need to do is wait until midnight on the final day.
You should remember how to get inside the Clock Tower. This time, it will be
a little easier since you don't need to buy that flower from the deku. All you
need is to walk up the small ramp to the right of the clock (as Link) and hop
up to the platform. Wait for midnight to arrive, watch the fireworks, then
climb the stairs.

Remember this? Only this time you're not a deku scrub, you're Link. Wait until
the cinematic sequence is over, then... take out your Ocarina. Yes, I said take
out your Ocarina. How can you beat the Skull Kid with an Ocarina, you ask?
Simple. Play the Oath to Order. Don't you remember? After beating Odowla, a big
giant taught you a song: the Oath to Order. If you've forgotten it, press START
and look at the Quest Status subscreen, then select the note for Oath to Order.
It should display the notes to play on a little stave below. Now play that song
on top of the Clock Tower....

- ODOWLA CHILD -

After flying up into the moon, you'll find yourself in a large field of green
grass with a large tree sitting in the center. Run up to the tree to find five
young children, each wearing a mask: Odowla's Mask, Ghot's Mask, Gyorg's mask,
TwinMold's Mask, and Majora's Mask. First, find the Odowla child running around
(he's wearing Odowla's mask). Talk to him and give him a mask (any mask will
work, but I'd recommend saving the Bunny Hood and Blast Mask as long as pos-
sible). You'll now find yourself in a mini-dungeon. In each of these dungeons
has a Piece of Heart and the child, hiding somewhere. In this one, transform
into a deku and use the flower to reach one of the flowers on the rotating
platform in the middle. If you got the Piece of Heart from the Deku Scrub Play-
ground, this will be a cinch. From this one, you can fly to the flower on the
ledge to the left. This way you will have an easier time reaching the next
rotating platform. Be careful, you'll have to land and burrow in one of the
flowers before the rotating spikes knock you off. From this flower, fly to the
ledge on the right to get the Piece of Heart. Use this flower to get back onto
the rotating platform, then you can fly to the doorway in the left corner. I'm
not sure, but you may need to use the larger yellow flower to get over the tree
branches. Enter and give the child another mask to get out. You'll be returned
to the field, and now the Odowla child will be gone.

KEY
^^ or ª or ´ or vv = JUMP RAMP
ÿ = WARP BACK TO START
 = TREASURE CHESTS x2 (empty, used for bouncing)
POH = PIECE OF HEART

Find the kid wearing Ghot's Mask and give him 2 of your masks to get in.

This is the most difficult of the four mini-dungeons. I added a map to make it
a bit easier. You have to roll along narrow ledges and use pairs of empty
treasure chests as bumpers to reach the Piece of Heart and the Ghot child at
the end. You'll obviously be doing this as a goron, and this is where the
Chateau Romani comes in. There are a few magic jars, but it's easier just to
use Chateau Romani. The best tip I can give you is to follow the lines on the
paths (in the game). There are dark lines that are right in the middle of the
paths. If you follow them precisely, you shouldn't have much trouble. Once you
get spiked out and roll off a jump, just let go of the control stick and keep
on holding A. If you're all lined up perfectly, you'll bounce off the empty
treasure chests and start rolling on a new course. This means that from the
first jump from the START to the four-way jump area, you'll never have to touch
the control stick. The treasure chests will do all the work. Some things to
keep in mind: you MUST be lined up correctly, or else the treasure chests will
do more harm than good and you'll have to start over. Also, once you're in the
air, you can't aim. Use this time to let go of the control stick if you're all
lined up. Here's the order of where to go and what to do:

From the START, get sorta lined up for the first jump and get back as far as
you can, then start rolling. Once you make the first jump, stop rolling and
walk past the treasure chests. You should see a small colorful warp tile that
will lead you back to the beginning. The good thing about this is that taking
the warp tiles lines you up perfectly for the whole run. Crouch by pressing A,
then push forward on the control stick. Try not to deviate too much from your
course. Make sure you're lined up on the line before you hit the ramp. You
should be spiked out just before you hit it. If you're lined up perfectly, you
will bounce off the chests at point 1 and fly right off the ramp to the chests
at point 2, which will set you on a direct course for point 3. Make sure you
don't touch the control stick at all after the very first jump. After bouncing
off of point 2, you'll fly over a series of three ledges, each with a warp pad.
Don't worry, if you've done it correctly, you shouldn't hit any of them. You'll
automatically hit the three ramps right in succession. If you're lined up per-
fectly, you'll bounce off the chests at point 3 and fly off the next ramp. As
soon as you land, let go of the A button. You'll probably end up somewhere near
point 4. You could conceivably roll all the way from the beginning to the Piece
of Heart, but it would involve some very dangerous turning.

That was fun, wasn't it? Now cross the bridge and go around the two gossip
stones and the warp pad. Cross the second bridge and go to point 5. Start your
roll, and aim for the ramp at point 6. If you steer yourself along the dark
line, you shouldn't have much trouble. After you make the jump, immediately let
go of the A button to land. Walk over to point 8 and make sure you're lined up
on the line perfectly. Begin rolling and jump the ramp. There's another warp
pad to avoid at point 9, but you shouldn't have any trouble flying past it and
jumping the next ramp. If you're lined up, you'll bounce off the chests at
point 10 and continue across another ramp that will put you at point 11. Grab
the Piece of Heart at the POH location on the map, then stand by point 11 and
line up for the next jump. After you land, go to point 12 and cross the bridge.
Walk past the warp pad and stand just past it at point 13. Face towards the
exit and roll. It may be a bit trickier since you have to go across the narrow
bridge. Once you jump the final ramp, enter the door, talk to the Ghot child
and give him another 2 masks to make him disappear from the moon field.

You'll need to give the Gyorg child 3 masks to play his hide-and-seek game.
You'll be playing as Mikau for this one. Put on the Zora Mask and follow my map
to reach the Piece of Heart first, then the END second. If you reach the end
accidentally before you get the Piece of Heart and find that you can't go back
because of the current, go ahead and talk to the child. When he asks for a
mask, just press B to quit and he'll let you restart.

To get the Piece of Heart (POH), jump in and take the left fork, then take the
right fork after that. Take the left fork immediately after that one and con-
tinue down that tunnel until you reach the Piece of Heart. Take it, then return
to START through the TO START tunnel.

To find the Gyorg child, first take the left fork, left fork, right fork, then
take the right fork. After that, continue down the tunnel to find the Gyorg
child. Give him three more masks and he'll be happy.

- TWINMOLD CHILD -

The final child is wearing the TwinMold mask. Talk to him and give him four
masks to play with him.  In this mini-dungeon, you'll be playing as Link. You
will have to fight three mini-bosses and use the Bombchus mentioned earlier to
get through (note: there are 10 Bombchus that you will receive in the dungeon,
but it may be easier if you have more). The first boss will be Dinofols. Not
tough at all, especially with the Great Fairy's Sword. The next boss is a bit
trickier: the Garo Master. You may remember him from the Stone Tower Temple.
Some people say Ice Arrows work, but I tried and he always blocks them. You're
welcome to try them, but I did it by using the Great Fairy Sword's spin attack.
Bombs may also help, but he often blocks those too. I also beat him with the
Blast Mask once, but that takes too long to recharge, plus it drains your
energy a bit. You can also try to hit him in the back with the Great Fairy
Sword, but it's really hard. Once he blows himself up, a chest will appear
containing some arrows. You'll need to use the hookshot to reach it. Take the
arrows, then enter the next door. You will now have to face the infamous Iron
Knuckle yet again. In Ocarina of Time, he was pretty tough, but this will be a
cinch. I highly recommend the Great Fairy's Sword for this, it will make Iron
Knuckle seem like a deku baba. Z-target him, then run around to his back and
hit him once to wake him up, twice to make him angry, then run away to really
make him mad. Once he starts moving around, run up right in front of him and
use the side jump maneuver (make sure you're an expert at this move, or else
you may end up doing a jump attack and placing yourself conveniently right
under his axe). If he pounds his axe into the floor, he'll take a moment to
recover. Use this time to do a jump attack with that sword. Quickly get out of
the way before he starts smacking you with his axe. Repeat the same strategy
until he falls apart. Another chest will appear. Oh yay, it contains ten Bomb-
chus... uh, how do you get up to the next door? Simple. USE THE BOMBCHUS! If
you look at the right wall, you'll see a portion of it that is cracked. There
are a few ways to time this right, but here's how I did it. Go to the opposite
wall and get lined up so that you're facing the crack in the wall. Take out a
Bombchu, but wait until it flashes twice before setting it down. If you timed
it right, it will explode right as it reaches the crack in the wall. Great, so
how does that help? Look closer and you'll see a yellow eye switch. Whip out
your Hero's Bow and shoot it to make a ladder appear nearby. In the next room,
you'll find a Piece of Heart. Okay... how do you get rid of the bars over the
door, you ask? Use the same strategy. This time, the crack is in the ceiling,
so use another Bombchu to blow it open. This time, the eye is frozen solid, so
shoot it with a Fire Arrow to open the door. In the final room, you'll meet up
with the TwinMold child. Give him your last four masks and you'll be returned
to the field.

-*- THE FINAL BATTLE -*-
NEW MASK: FIERCE DEITY'S MASK

There's only one more child left: Majora child. Run up to him and talk to him.
Since you have no more masks, he'll give you the Fierce Deity's Mask. This is
the final battle. Note that if you have the Fierce Deity's Mask and plan on
using it, the next section is nothing but a spoiler about the final boss, and
he's so easy you don't even need to read it.

- MAJORA'S MASK -

The first phase of the battle is against the Majora's Mask that the Skull Kid
has been wearing the whole time. After the four boss masks have taken their
places on the wall, the Majora's Mask will come alive and begin to fly around
the room. Put on the Fierce Deity's Mask, then Z-target the flying mask. Using
your sword, you'll be able to send fireballs at the mask. Only one is needed to
bring the mask down to your level. Run over to it and whack it with that great
ugly sword of yours. Repeat this until the mask is defeated.

- MAJORA'S INCARNATION -

The second form of the battle is against the Majora's Incarnation, which is
basically the mask with two arms and two legs. Pretty simple, just hit it with
your sword repeatedly.

- MAJORA'S WRATH -

The third and final form of the monster will sprout a head and gain some
muscles, along with some very long whip-tentacles. Use the Fierce Deity's Mask
and kill him for good with your sword. Easy as pie.

|FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS|
|óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó|

At first, I only got a few questions, and half of them were: "How do I get
epona?" (notice the lower-case initial letter of a proper noun). The other half
were: "Can I use your walkthrough?" I don't really mind getting the same
question over and over, but I do mind if I have to type up "Beat Snowhead...
go to the Bomb Shop... Take the Powder Keg Test... Take it to the Goron
Racetrack, etc." over and over again. This section has two purposes: to answer
your questions quicker, and so that I can copy-and-paste the answer right into
my e-mail. By now, I've been getting a lot more questions, so I'll probably
include each question as I get it so that if the question comes up again, I can
save typing time by copying it from here.

Q: How do I get epona (notice the lower-case... just kidding, bad grammar
joke :)
A: To get Epona (notice the correct upper-case initial letter of the proper
noun), you need to beat Snowhead Temple (or at least get the Fire Arrow from
inside Snowhead Temple). Then, on your way back to Goron village, look to the
left as soon as you enter the Goron Pond area (the part with three islands,
wolfos, and Tingle). You should see some ramps. Remember that spot, it leads up
to the Goron Racetrack (no, you won't find Epona up there). Now, go to Goron
Village and find the cave (the Goron Bomb Shop). It was all frozen before.
Enter, then talk to Medigoron (as Darmani the Goron) to get a test keg. Throw
it up past the first ramp, roll up to it, then repeat. Take the keg to the
Goron Pond area and throw it up the ramps to reach the stone blocking Goron
Racetrack. Set it down, then yell "Fire in the hole!" and wait for it to blow
up. Now RETURN TO THE GORON BOMB SHOP and talk to Medigoron to become certified
to carry powder kegs (once you use the Song of Time, you will now be permanen-
tly certified to carry powder kegs). Return to the first day with the Song of
Time and go to the Clock Town Bomb shop (it's cheaper there) and talk to the
goron there (as Darmani the Goron) and buy another powder keg from him for 50
rupees. Here's where Epona comes in. Take this powder keg down to Milk Road
(south of Clock Town) and place the keg in front of the boulder there, then
wait for it to blow. Enter Romani Ranch, then talk to Romani (the little girl)
and learn Epona's Song from her. Now, when you play the Song of Time, you'll
still have the song in your memory. Play it to call Epona. NOTE: You can only
get Epona on the first day before 6 pm.

Q: Where is the Great Bay Temple Fairy Fountain?
A: The Great Bay Fairy Fountain is on a cliff on shore. To get to it, hop along
the small islands near the beach and use the hookshot on the palm trees if you
need to. Once you reach the cliff wall, use a bomb to enter the fairy fountain.

Q: Where is the Stone Tower Temple Fairy Fountain?
A: It's south of Pamela's house in a small cave near the entrance to the
Ancient Castle of Ikana.

Q: I didn't get all the eggs from Pinnacle Rock before returning to the lab.
Can I get back to Pinnacle Rock without the golden seahorse?
A: Yes. As long as you haven't killed all the sea snakes and reunited the two
long lost seahorses, the seahorse will be back at the beginning of the maze
when you return and will lead you through.

Q: Okay, so I already reunited the seahorses. Can I still get back anyway?
A: No and yes. No because it's really really hard, yes because it is humanly
possible. You have to follow the seahorse's path exactly. Otherwise, you'll
just warp back to Great Bay. It may be easier to just play the Song of Time and
start over. Sorry :-(

Q: How do you pronounce Termina?
A: It's pronounced tur-MEE-nah, not TER-min-uh. You may be thinking that it's
based on the word "terminate." But actually, if you learn Japanese Katakana and
go to www.nintendo.co.jp and check out the Majora's Mask page, you'll see that
the name of Termina in Japanese is "Terumina" which is pronounced as "teh-rdoo-
mee-nah." In fact, just like "Majola's Mask," the English name was originally
going to be Talmina, due to the fact that the Japanese "r" sound is unlike any
sound in English and sounds like a combination of r, d, and l. This was the
cause of the Zola-Zora confusion. Anyway, if the intended English pronouncia-
tion was "TER-min-uh," the Japanese spelling would've been "Taamena."

Q: How do I get those rupees in the Laundry Pool?
A: I don't know why you'd want to bother with those, there's a Takkuri that
spits out 200 rupees every time you beat him south of Clock Town, but in case
you're dying to know, they'll float out into the main pool on the Night of the
Second Day (I think).

Q: What time zone are you in?
A: I seriously get this a lot in Instant Messages. I am in the Pacific Time
Zone, so unless you are too (or you're in Alaska time), chances are, you're an
hour or two (or three or four or even eight) hours later than I am. Someone
sent me an IM from Scotland, so it was the middle of the night there while it
was my dinner time here.

I'll add more later when I get more e-mails.

NAME: SONG OF TIME
NOTES: RC, A, DC, :|
LEARNED FROM: Memory of Princess Zelda
USE: Use this to save your game permanently and to go back to Dawn of the First
Day. VERY important, you will get nowhere without this (duh). This is the same
song that was in Ocarina of Time, but it's much more important this time (it
can do more than just moving blue blocks).

NAME: SONG OF HEALING
NOTES: LC, RC, DC, :|
LEARNED FROM: Happy Mask Salesman
USE: To turn yourself back into a human (only once) and to HEAL people (when
ever they say "I need my soul to be HEALed," or something like that, his song
will solve their problems). It's also just a really peaceful song. Notice that
this is Saria's Song in reverse.

NAME: EPONA'S SONG
NOTES: UC, LC, RC, :|
LEARNED FROM: Romani
USE: Calls your horse, Epona. Wherever she may be, she will magically appear in
front of you, galloping towards you even if you play it facing a wall or some-
thing. She may not be able to reach you, depending on where you are (if you can
ride her there, she can get to you there, but there may be little obstacles in
the way that any horse would be able to go around). This song was also in
Ocarina of Time.

NAME: SONG OF SOARING
NOTES: DC, LC, UC, :|
LEARNED FROM: Kaepora Gaebora
USE: Once you play it, a map will be displayed. All the owl statues that you
hit with your sword will be shown on the map. Choose one to fly there instant-
ly. Very useful.

NAME: SONG OF STORMS
NOTES: A, DC, UC, :|
LEARNED FROM: Ghost of the Flat composer
USE: Waters beans and can restore dried up rivers. Also in OoT.

NAME: SONATA OF AWAKENING
NOTES: UC, LC, UC, LC, A, RC, A
LEARNED FROM: MONKEY
USE: Opens Woodfall Temple, awakens things.

NAME: LULLABY INTRO
NOTES: A, RC, LC, :|
LEARNED FROM: GORON ELDER
USE: Calms the baby goron who won't stop crying. GORON LULLABY will replace
this song once you learn it from the baby.

NAME: GORON LULLABY
NOTES: A, RC, LC, A, RC, LC, RC, A
LEARNED FROM: BABY GORON
USE: Puts gorons to sleep, including ones with breath like a strong wind....
This song replaces LULLABY INTRO.

NAME: NEW WAVE BOSSA NOVA
NOTES: LC, UC, LC, RC, DC, LC, RC
LEARNED FROM: ZORA HATCHLINGS
USE: Awakens giant turtles disguised as small islands... and Lulu.

NAME: ELEGY OF EMPTYNESS
NOTES: RC, LC, RC, DC, RC, UC, LC
LEARNED FROM: IGOS DU IKANA
USE: Creates a dummy of yourself in whatever form you're in. You can have up to
one for each form (so you can only have one Link dummy at a time, one Darmani
dummy at a time, etc.). You can leave the dummies on switches to keep them
down (the Deku dummy can't be used, it's too light weight). Use this to enter
the Stone Tower Temple.

NAME: OATH TO ORDER
NOTES: RC, DC, A, DC, RC, UC
LEARNED FROM: SOUTHERN GIANT
USE: Try playing this on top of the Clock Tower after Midnight on the 3rd day.

*The following songs do not appear on the STATUS subscreen, nor are they saved.
They do NOT need to be learned to be used*

NAME: INVERSE SONG OF TIME
NOTES: DC, A, RC, :|
LEARNED FROM: SCARECROW
USE: Slows down time (VERY useful and important, this slows down time so that
it takes two real-time minutes for one game hour to pass). You don't need to
learn it before you use it.

NAME: SONG OF DOUBLE TIME
NOTES: RC, RC, A, A, DC, DC
LEARNED FROM: SCARECROW
USE: Skips ahead to either night or day. This is just like the Sun's Song from
Ocarina of Time, just different notes. You don't need to learn it before you
use it.

NAME: SCARECROW SONG
NOTES: DC, RC, UC, RC, LC, UC, RC, A
LEARNED FROM: ME! (you can make up your own eight-note song, but this is the
one I always use). You must visit the scarecrow in Clock Town to teach him the
song (you can teach him anything you want, as long as it's more than two
notes). If you've played through Ocarina of Time, you'll know how this works.
The only difference is that it's not saved.
USE: If a scarecrow is nearby, but underground, play the Scarecrow Song to make
him pop up. You can shoot him with your hookshot to pull yourself to him. Use-
ful for reaching distant heart pieces!

|MASKS|
|óóóóó|

-*- TRANSFORMATION MASKS -*-

DEKU MASK
RECEIVED FROM: HAPPY MASK SALESMAN
HOW TO GET IT: After recovering the Ocarina of Time, visit the Happy Mask
salesman to learn the Song of Healing, which will turn you into a human and put
the spirit of the Deku Butler's Son into the Deku Mask.
USE: Transforms you into a deku scrub (see CHARACTERS, MAIN section for
details).

GORON MASK
RECEIVED FROM: SPIRIT OF DARMANI
HOW TO GET IT: After recieving the Lens of Truth from the Goron Village cave,
use it to look at the Spirit of Darmani (above the shadow). Follow Darmani to
the Hot Spring cave, then play the Song of Healing to receive the Goron Mask.
USE: Transforms you into Darmani (see CHARACTERS, MAIN section for details).

ZORA MASK
RECEIVED FROM: MIKAU
HOW TO GET IT: Out in Great Bay floats Mikau, on the verge of death, with the
seagulls about to eat him. Spoil their dinner (or breakfast, or lunch) by
grabbing onto the Zora and pushing him to shore. After singing his last, he
will leave you his guitar, along with his spirit, sealed in the Zora mask.
USE: Transforms you into Mikau (see CHARACTERS, MAIN section for details).

FIERCE DEITY'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: MAJORA CHILD
HOW TO GET IT: Give away all 20 masks to the children on the moon, then talk to
the child wearing Majora's Mask. Since you have no more masks, he'll give you
the Fierce Deity's Mask.
USE: This frightening mask can only be used in battle against bosses. It will
transform you into a large armored version of Link carrying a bigger sword
which can send out fireballs. You may see this character referred to as Oni
Link, but this isn't in the English version. The word "oni" is the Japanese
word for a demon, but the English version wouldn't sound very good as "Demon
Link," so I'm assuming they didn't name him. I just call him "Fierce Diety
Link" since that's what the mask is called. Some people acall him "FD Link."

-*- NON-TRANSFORMATION MASKS -*-

Remember: Even though many of these masks may seem to be not very useful
*coughcircusleader'smaskcough* and difficult to get *coughcouple'smaskcough*,
you need to get all twenty of them to get the coveted Fierce Diety's Mask. I
don't care if you think it makes the final battle too easy, it's an awesome
mask to have even if you never use it much (plus it just seems kinda silly to
have 23 masks). If you don't think it's worth it to get all 24 masks, then
please do not complain to me about this game being shorter than OoT.

POSTMAN'S HAT
RECEIVED FROM: POSTMAN
HOW TO GET IT: Go through the Kafei side quest. When you get the Express Mail
to Mama from the Curiosity Shop owner, take it to the post office and give it
to the postman. He'll be so happy that he'll deliver it to Kafei's Mama. Talk
to the postman outside the Milk Bar to get the Postman's Hat.
USE: Check the mailbox once to find a Piece of Heart. Use it again to find a
green rupee (trust me, your time would be better spent killing Takkuri if you
want lots of rupees). Ka-ching!

ALL-NIGHT MASK
RECEIVED FROM: CURIOSITY SHOP
HOW TO GET IT: At midnight on the first day, stake out North Clock Town with
your sword ready. Sakon the thief will attack the old lady from the Bomb shop,
so hit him with your sword to make him drop her pack. Now make sure you have
500 rupees (you must have the giant's wallet by finding all 30 skulltulas in
the Great Bay Skulltula House on the first day). After 10 pm on the Final Day,
visit the Curiosity Shop to find the All Night Mask on sale for 500 rupees. Buy
it!
USE: Visit the Old Lady in the Stock Pot Inn and listen to her two stories
while wearing the mask to stay awake the whole time. You'll win a piece of
heart for each story, but only if you answer the questions correctly. For the
first story, the answer is "The Carnival of Time." For the other story, the
answer is "I dunno." Trust me.

BLAST MASK
RECEIVED FROM: OLD LADY FROM BOMB SHOP
HOW TO GET IT: At midnight on the first day, stake out North Clock Town with
your sword ready. Sakon the thief will attack the old lady from the Bomb shop,
so hit him with your sword to make him drop her pack. Once he takes off, the
old lady will reward you with the Blast Mask.
USE: If you're out of Bombs, don this mask and press B to blast yourself. It
hurts, and it has to recharge between uses, but it's worth it if you're out of
Bombs. You can also prevent yourself from getting hurt by raising your shield
as you use it.

STONE MASK
RECEIVED FROM: SHIRO
HOW TO GET IT: In Ikana Valley, across from the entrance to the graveyard,
there is a circle of stones. In the middle sits Shiro, an unknown soldier who
has sat there like a rock for years, but nobody has seen him. Use the Lens of
Truth to find him, then give him a red or blue potion. He'll give you the
very useful Stone Mask.
USE: Basically makes you invisible. Very few enemies will be able to see you,
but you can still see yourself (obviously). Most Gerudo guards (female pirates)
won't notice you, either (there are a couple of guards who can see you). Use
this to get the perfect picture for the fisherman (a good shot is to hop onto
the Bow of a boat and face the guard in the boat, then take a pictograph). I'm
not sure, but this may make you invisible to Sakon, the thief, on day three.
Also, the Stone Mask is the ticket to fast and easy rupees! (uh oh, I'm start-
ing to sound like some kind of spam mail). Put on the Stone Mask and shoot down
Takkuri (the vulture bird near Milk Road). With the Stone Mask on, he won't
steal from you since he can't see you.

GREAT FAIRY'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: GREAT FAIRY
HOW TO GET IT: Complete the Great Fairy in Clock Town as Link to receive this
mask. 
USE: Wear it to attract the lost fairies in the duneons. Return all 15 of the
lost fairies to the nearby Great Fairy to get a new ability or item....

KEATON'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: CURIOSITY SHOP OWNER
HOW TO GET IT: Go through the Kafei sequence to enter the back door to the
Curiosity Shop on day two after about 1 pm. The shop owner will give you
Kafei's Keaton Mask and the Express Mail to Mama.
USE: Wear it, then chop up some of the moving shrubs (like in North Clock Town
or the Milk Road). Keaton will appear. If you answer his questions, he'll give
you a prize.

BREMEN MASK
RECEIVED FROM: GURU-GURU
HOW TO GET IT: Visit Guru-Guru at night by the Laundry Pool to listen to his
story. He'll give you the Bremen Mask.
USE: Press AND HOLD the B button to march around playing a marching song on
your Ocarina (where are those drum sounds coming from?). Only logical use: in
the chicken coop on Romani Ranch, march around and get all the chicks to follow
you. Once all of them are in line, they'll grow into chickens. Grog the chicken
keeper will be so happy, he'll give you the Bunny Hood.

BUNNY HOOD
RECEIVED FROM: GROG
HOW TO GET IT: Use the Bremen Mask on the many chicks at Romani Ranch to make
them grow older. The chicken keeper will be so happy, he'll give you the Bunny
Hood.
USE: Wear it as link to run really fast. It also allows you to jump as far as
Mikau can jump (for you Zora dummies, you can jump farthur as Mikau than Link).
Another random use is the postman's 10-second game. While wearing the bunny
hood, you will be able to see the timer the whole time. I actually hit ten
seconds on the nose the first time I used the bunny hood. Maybe this is because
the postman is the running guy from Ocarina of Time, who buys the bunny hood
from you.... Maybe this also explains the mysterious white bunny logo seen on
the Postman's Hat.... What is it with this man and bunnies? Yah!

DON GERO'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: HUNGRY GORON
HOW TO GET IT: Calm the baby Goron, then light all the torches in the Goron
Shrine to make the chandelier start rotating. Start rolling in the baby's room,
then jump off the ramp to break the pots on the chandelier. The Top Sirloin
Rock is in one of these. Grab it, then take it to the hungry goron in the
Mountain Village. Throw it up to him to receive Don Gero's frog mask.
USE: Show it to all five frogs (after defeating Snowhead), then return to the
pond where the icebergs used to be. The five frogs will be sitting on lily pads
waiting to sing you a song....

MASK OF SCENTS
RECEIVED FROM: DEKU BUTLER
HOW TO GET IT: After rescuing the Deku Princess from Woodfall Temple, enter the
cave to the left of the Deku Palace (to the left while facing the palace).
Follow the Butler through the cave all the way to the end to receive the Mask
of Scents. If you have the Bunny Hood, transform back to your human form and
put on the hood to make it much easier. Make sure you're human once you reach
the fire maze. Touching the flames will scorch your little deku body, sending
you back to the beginning. For the jumping parts, also make sure you use Link,
since he can jump farthur.
USE: Use it in the Woods of Mystery, the Southern Swamp, and the Stock Pot Inn
to find purple mushrooms. Put the shrooms in a bottle and sell them to Kotake.

ROMANI'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: CREMIA
HOW TO GET IT: Save the ranch from "Them," then wait until the middle of the
night on the Second Day to hitch a ride with Cremia, Romani's older sister. The
wagon has to take a detour through the Gorman Track, so either shoot the Gorman
Brothers with your Bow to save the wagon, or wear the Gorman Mask to prevent
the brothers from attacking. You'll win the mask, and possibly a hug, from
Cremia.
USE: Lets you into the milk bar at night.

CIRCUS LEADER'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: GORMAN
HOW TO GET IT: Use the Romani Mask to enter the Milk Bar at night. Use your
Ocarina, Deku Pipes, Drums, and Guitar to play the Ballad of the Wind Fish. The
nearby Circus Leader will hear it and give you his sad mask.
USE: Use it on the Gorman Brothers.... They won't attack the Milk Wagon! They
will also be too sad to race you if you wear it in front of them.

KAFEI'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: MADAME AROMA
HOW TO GET IT: Talk to Madame Aroma in the Boarding Room of the Mayor's Office
on the first day to be hired by Madame Aroma. She asks you to find her son,
Kafei. She'll give you this mask that looks like him.
USE: Use it to ask the townsfolk if they've seen him. This is a very long
sequence that takes up all three days.

COUPLE'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: KAFEI AND ANJU
HOW TO GET IT: Follow the Anju / Kafei sequence described in the SIDE MISSIONS
section to get it from Anju and Kafei.
USE: Put it on, then use it to end the Mayor's meeting to win a Piece of Heart.

MASK OF TRUTH
RECEIVED FROM: SKULLTULA MAN
HOW TO GET IT: Enter the Woodfall Skulltula house and capture all 30 skulltula
spirits (see SIDE MISSIONS section for details).
USE: Wear this mask to get secrets from the Gossip Stones (the rocks with the
one eye just like the Mask of Truth). You can also read the thoughts of dogs
by picking them up while wearing the mask. Dogs that say "Ruff!" run very fast,
dogs that say "Rrr-ruff!" run kind of fast, and dogs that say "Ho-whine!" won't
run fast. Use this to win the Piece of Heart from the doggy races (bet 80 ru-
pees and get first or second to win).

KAMARO'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: KAMARO
HOW TO GET IT: Between the hours of 12:00 am (midnight) and 6:00 am, visit
Kamaro, dancing on one of the gigantic mushroom-shaped rocks north-west of
Clock Town in Termina Field (you should be able to hear his music as he
dances). Jump over and learn the dance from him in the form of a mask. Now,
go make it popular!
USE: Press AND HOLD B to dance like Kamaro. Dance in front of the Rosa Twins as
they dance in west clock town every night to teach them how to dance. You'll be
rewarded with a Piece of Heart.

GIBDO'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: PAMELA'S FATHER
HOW TO GET IT: Play the Song of Storms in the cave up above in Ikana to restore
the river. If Pamela runs inside her house, place a Bomb on her step and run
around the south corner. She'll come out and head to the well, so run inside
her house. Go downstairs and open the cabinet. Quickly play the Song of Healing
for Pamela's dad to heal him. He'll turn back into a human and leave you the
Gibdo Mask.
USE: When you wear this, the Gibdo's will ignore you. You can even talk to
them....

GARO'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: GORMAN BROTHERS
HOW TO GET IT: Once you get Epona, race the Gorman Brothers at their race track
to win this mask. You must beat both of them in order to win this mask. A good
strategy is to get in front of one or both of them and prevent them from pass-
ing you. This buys you precious seconds. Use carrots slowly, since they regen-
erate faster if you use less of them. Use a few, though, to jump over the
fences that the Gorman Bros. have to go around. It's tough, but possible.
USE: Allows you to enter Ikana Canyon. The Garos will pop out of the ground
in certain places. Beat them to get a hint.

CAPTAIN'S HAT
RECEIVED FROM: GIANT SKELETON
HOW TO GET IT: In the graveyard, play the Sonata of Awakening to wake up the
giant skeleton. Shoot him with a few arrows, then fight him with your sword.
Once you defeat him, run up the trail to talk to him. He'll turn off the fire,
so use your hookshot to reach the chest. Open it to receive the Captain's Hat.
USE: Use it to get useful and funny reactions from the Stalchildren. If you
wear it during the battle against Igos du Ikana, you'll get an even funnier
reaction.

GIANT'S MASK
RECEIVED FROM: EYEGORE
HOW TO GET IT: In Stone Tower Temple, just before fighting Twinmold, beat the
Eyegore to get this mask. To beat Eyegore, run up to him, let him raise his
arms, run away a bit, then shoot him with the hookshot or an arrow when his
eye turns yellow.
USE: Use it only during the battle with Twinmold in the Stone Tower Temple.
Obviously, this mask makes you huge. It also consumes magic power. Make sure
you have some magic-refilling potions and the magic upgrade, or the Chateau
Romani from the Milk Bar.

-*- ITEMS -*-

OCARINA OF TIME
USED BY: LINK, SCRUB, DARMANI, AND MIKAU
LOCATION: CLOCK TOWER
HOW TO GET IT: As a Deku Scrub on the last day after midnight, climb the clock
tower and shoot the Skull Kid with a bubble. He'll drop the Ocarina, so take it
and don't lose it again!
USE: The most important item in the game, and the funnest too! Play with the
four C buttons and the A button. Top C is the note D, Left C is the note B,
Right C is the note A, Down C is the note F, and A is the note D. Using these
five notes, you can play anything in the game that you need to. Using the con-
trol stick, you can push Up to push the note up one step, and vice versa. You
can press R to push it up a half step, and Z to push it down a half step (usu-
ally to make the note sharp or flat). There are ten songs you can play on it,
but you can also just play anything you want to. See the SONGS section for more
details. One last note (Get it? Last note? Get it? Sorry...) is that when you
transform into another creature (Deku, Goron or Zora), your instrument changes
to the Deku Pipes, Goron Drums, and Mikau's Guitar respectively. This way, you
can play different instruments by transforming into other people! Once you have
all three masks and Romani's Mask, check out the Milk Bar at night and talk to
Toto the zora....

One final note on the Ocarina. If, for some reason, you want to play a song
that will do something special and you don't want it to have that effect, hold
the L button while you play (meaning if you hold L while playing the notes to,
for example, the Song of Time, it won't do anything at all). This will also
prevent the transformed instruments from being animated (meaning if you hold L
while playing Mikau's Guitar for example, you won't see Mikau actually moving
his arm, but the notes will still sound).

HERO'S BOW
USED BY: LINK
LOCATION: WOODFALL TEMPLE
HOW TO GET IT: Beat the Lizalfos to win the Bow.
USE: Long range projectile. Press the C button to take it out, and the camera
will switch to First Person (like you're looking through Link's eyes). Press 
and hold the same C button again to take out an arrow, then release to shoot it
(you might want to aim first too). Or, if you're in a hurry, once you switch to
first person, you can simply tap the C button to quickly fire an arrow, but
make sure you've aimed first. Use the arrows to shoot flying enemies, distant
enemies, dangerous enemies, crystal switches, balloons, the Gorman Bros., and
whatever else you want to.
INITIAL AMMUNITION LIMIT: 30
UPGRADE ONE: LARGE QUIVER (40)
HOW TO GET IT: Go to either the Town Shooting Gallery or the Swamp Shooting
Gallery. If you beat the record of 39 at the Town Shooting Gallery, you'll win
this upgrade. If you get a perfect score at the Swamp Shooting Gallery, you'll
also get it, as long as you don't already have it.
UPGRADE TWO: LARGEST QUIVER (50)

shops. You can also kill the kind of Deku Babas that just stand straight up and

use is to light them on fire and use them to light torches or spiderwebs.
Basically useless after getting the Fire Arrow.

DEKU NUT
USED BY: LINK AND SCRUB
LOCATION: LOST WOODS, PLANTS, POTS, ROCKS, SHOPS, AND DEKU BABAS

with the pink flowers and bottomless pit), or find them in the same kind of
places that you would find a deku stick.

Shop. After you've completed the test, you can carry Powder Kegs, but only one
at a time. You can also buy one from the Goron in the Bomb Shop in Clock Town.

blow up the gigantic boulders like the one near Romani Ranch.
LIMIT: 1

are and aren't. It also shows hidden things like ghosts, rungs, and hungry
soldiers....

HOOKSHOT
USED BY: LINK
LOCATION: PIRATES' FORTRESS
HOW TO GET IT: Climb the guard tower, cross the bridge, enter the upper room,
shoot the beehive, enter the lower room, and open the chest to receive the
Hookshot.
USE: One of the most important items in the game. The Hookshot is a spike
attached to a long chain. When fired, the hook will pull the chain out. If the
hook latches onto something, the chain will retract and pull you to the object.
It can also be used as a weapon. The hook will usually work on wood, scare-
crows, targets, target posts, stone torches, and other things. It is aimed much
like the Hero's Bow.

GREAT FAIRY SWORD
USED BY: LINK
LOCATION: IKANA VALLEY
HOW TO GET IT: Rescue all 15 fairies from Stone Tower Temple, then return them
to the Great Fairy Fountain found near Pamela's house.
USE: The biggest and best sword, but it's used as a C Item and doesn't replace
your Gilded Sword (you do have the Gilded Sword, don't you?). You can do jump
attacks, stabs, and spin attacks by spinning the control stick in a circle and
hitting the C button (it doesn't work if you just hold it and release, so you
better practice spinning the control stick!).

BOTTLES
USED BY: LINK, SCRUB, DARMANI, MIKAU
LOCATION: VARIOUS (see BOTTLES section for details)
HOW TO GET IT: VARIOUS (see BOTTLES section for details)
USE: Press the C button once to swing it (if it's empty). If there is anything
you can catch nearby, it will go into the bottle. Use it to store red fairies, 
red, green, and blue potions, spring water, hot spring water, milk, zora eggs,
small princesses, and other small items. Use it again to take the item out /
drink the contents / release the contents / etc.

TRADING ITEMS
USED BY: LINK, SCRUB, DARMANI, MIKAU
LOCATION: VARIOUS
HOW TO GET IT: VARIOUS
USE: Use these items (placed on the right side of the ITEMS subscreen) for many
things. Usually, these items can be traded for different items, which can then
be traded again, and again, etc. Some items are just used to give to people,
while others may just be for your use. To give an item to a person, wait until
the message "Press START to set the item to C" etc. is displayed, then press
START and set the item to C if you haven't already done so, then press C to
give it to them WHILE THAT MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED! Otherwise, they may not take
it, or you may drink it, etc. Usually, trade items have no logical use for you,
and you can't use them. Also, they will disappear when you use the Song of Time
to save.

under water in Goron Pond.

LOCATION: OCEANSIDE SPIDER HOUSE

Answer the question "I dunno" to receive the Piece of Heart (trust me).

LOCATION: DOGGY RACETRACK
HOW TO GET IT: First, you really should get the Mask of Truth from the Swamp
Spider House (see the SIDE MISSIONS section for details). Go to the Doggy Race-
track located on Romani Ranch. Enter and talk to Mamayu Yan, the doggy lady
from Ocarina of Time. Talk to her and bet at least 80 rupees. Now, put on the
Mask of Truth and pick up a doggy. If the doggy says "RUFF!" at the beginning,
then keep that doggy and use it in the race. If it just says "RR-RUFF!" Don't
keep it, it probably won't win. If it says "HO-WHINE!" let it rest it's tired
little legs, it won't win. Find one that says "RUFF!" and take it to Mamayu
Yan. Say yes to enter it in the race. If it gets 1st place, you'll get three
times the rupees you bet (meaning if you bet 80, you'll 240 rupees). If your
dog gets 2nd place, you'll get double (if you bet 80, you'll get 160). If you
get 3rd - 5th, you'll get your rupees back. As long as you picked a dog that
says "RUFF!" you should get at least 5th place. If you win more than 150 rupees
(if you bet 80 rupees and took 1st or 2nd place), you will win a Piece of Heart
as a special prize!

LOCATION: GREAT BAY
HOW TO GET IT: After beating the Great Bay Temple, visit the small peninsula in
Great Bay (near the lone Like Like). A small boat will be docked. Hop on to
ride over to the islands. Use the hookshot to reach the tall island. Talk to
the fisherman to play the Jumping Game. Jump onto the island with the lit torch
to score a point. Score 20 points in 2 minutes to win.

LOCATION: GREAT BAY
HOW TO GET IT: Kill the Like Like in the pool by the falls. Either shoot it
with arrows on land or dive down as Mikau to kill it and take it's prize.

LOCATION: EAST CLOCK TOWN
HOW TO GET IT: Get a perfect score at Honey & Darling's game three days in a
row to win a Piece of Heart. Their game changes daily. The rules are simple:
destroy all the targets (or baskets) with the item they give you in the time
allowed. If you fall off the platform, you'll lose. Also, on day 3, if you
happen to shoot Honey and/or Darling with an arrow they'll say "That hurts!"
but you won't lose. In fact, you'll even gain a few seconds! Y'know, if I got
shot with an arrow by a dippy kid in green, I'd do more than say "That hurts!"

LOCATION: EAST CLOCK TOWN
HOW TO GET IT: Get a perfect score at the shooting gallery (50). It's tough,
but possible. Try to memorize where the red Octoroks will appear and shoot as
soon as they pop up. You'll have to be fast and accurate. If you miss, you may
not have time to reload and fire again. Sometimes, there will be multiple
Octoroks hiding behind the front one, so don't stop just because you already
shot one, another may be hiding behind it. Also, don't jump the gun and shoot
a blue one, hitting only one blue octorok will cost you the whole game since
you'll lose precious seconds. Practice a lot and you should eventually get it.

LOCATION: NORTH CLOCK TOWN
HOW TO GET IT: This has to be the hardest part of the game, but at least it's
good practice. In North Clock Town is a Deku Scrub Playground, just south of
the Great Fairy Fountain (it's in a grotto behind the fence, use a flower to
reach it). You better have a lot of rupees, because this will be tough. You
have to collect six rupees on floating platforms in under 1:15:00, three days
in a row. Easier said than done. The game on the first day shouldn't be too
hard. If it is, good luck, you'll never make it. The second day's game is a
nightmare. First, land on one of the outer platforms, then try to get the two
in the next row. Next, get the middle two, and now try to get the last one. It
is possible. The third day isn't much better. The two outer platforms and the
two inner platforms are revolving around the center, while the two in between
will rise up and down. Use the starting flower on the left ONLY and fly to the
first up-and-down platform. From there, it shouldn't be too tough to reach the
two in the middle, then the other up-and-down one. Now go for the outer two.
it may be a little easier if you try to land on one of the outer ones first,
but be ready to head for the up-and-down one if you don't make it. Good Luck.

LOCATION: SNOWHEAD TRAIL
HOW TO GET IT: First, teach the scarecrow a song, then go to the trail leading
up to Snowhead (the one with all the Goron ramp jumps). A Piece of Heart is
waiting on a little platform waaay out there. No, your hookshot won't reach
that far, so whip out your Lens of Truth to find the platforms leading to it.
Be careful, they're made of ice. Once you jump, let go of the control stick so
you don't go sliding off them. Once you reach the last one, play the Scarecrow
Song to make him appear. Now use your hookshot to reach him and get the Piece
of Heart. Now jump off (it won't hurt too much), or use the Song of Soaring to
return.

LOCATION: ZORA HALL
HOW TO GET IT: As Mikau, go into Japas's room and take out your guitar. Jam
with him by playing the following:
JAPAS: RC, RC, DC, A
YOU: A, DC, RC, A
JAPAS: LC, LC, RC, DC
YOU: DC, RC, LC, DC
Only play the YOU lines after Japas plays the JAPAS lines. The problem is, it's
so cool that Evan, the band leader, won't like the fact that he didn't write
it himself. Go to Evan's room and turn back into Link (or any other form other
than Mikau). Play all four of those lines on your instrument, including the
ones Japas played. Evan will hear the notes and say that he wrote it. He'll
give you a Piece of Heart for teaching him the song. I'd say that's a pretty
good deal, since he did steal your tune....

LOCATION: SOUTHERN SWAMP
HOW TO GET IT: On the road to the Southern Swamp is a tree, a really big one
with lots of weird looking branches. Shoot all the Bad Bats first, then climb
the vines growing on the tree. Hidden in the middle of the branches is a Piece
of Heart.

LOCATION: TERMINA FIELD
HOW TO GET IT: Around Termina Field are four secret grottos, each with four
Gossip Stones, three little and one big (they all say the same thing in the
four different grottos, but you don't need to read them, I'll tell you what to
do). In each of the grottos, one of the Gossip Stones is bigger than the rest.
When you play a certain song for it, it will change color. Here's a list:

SONATA OF AWAKENING PLAYED BY DEKU BUTLER'S SON: Green
GORON LULLABY PLAYED BY DARMANI: Red
NEW WAVE BOSSA NOVA PLAYED BY MIKAU: Blue

You must hunt down all four grottos and play the same song for each of the Big
Gossip Stones (so if you play the New Wave Bossa Nova as Mikau for one of them,
play the New Wave Bossa Nova for the other three). You'll notice that once you
find the second one, one of the smaller gossip stones is already that color.
What you're trying to do is make all four Gossip Stones the same color. It's
kind of confusing for me to describe, you'll understand. Here's the approximate
locations of the four grottos:

NORTH OF CLOCK TOWN (just to the right of the snowy area outside the North En-
trance to Clock Town)
WEST OF THE SOUTHERN SWAMP ROAD
WEST OF CLOCK TOWN (under the boulder)
JUST NORTH OF THE ASTRAL OBSERVATORY

LOCATION: CLOCK TOWN BANK
HOW TO GET IT: Deposit more than 5,000 rupees at the bank to fill up your
account and win a Piece of Heart. Now you can't deposit any more rupees until
you withdraw some.

LOCATION: TREASURE CHEST GAME (CLOCK TOWN)
HOW TO GET IT: As Darmani, find your way through the invisible maze to the
chest at the other end. Hold the Z Button to hold the camera up higher to give
you a better view.

LOCATION: TERMINA FIELD
HOW TO GET IT: Just west of the Astral Observatory is a secret grotto, used as
a storehouse for a deku scrub. If you try to go down there, all you'll find is
some grass and a crate. So, get a bean and fly over the fence to the soft soil
using the nearby pink flower. Plant the bean there, water it (with the Song of
Storms), then enter the Astral Observatory. Look over Clock Town through the
telescope, then follow the path of the scrub as he flies around, and then down
into his storehouse. Exit the observatory, then use the bean platform to get
outside the fence quickly. Run over and drop down to find the scrub salesman.
He's not too pleased, so he'll try to sell you a Piece of Heart for 150 rupees.
That seems a little steep, don't you think? I wouldn't take it for that much.
Maybe you can get it down to 100 rupees if you refuse....

LOCATION: TERMINA FIELD
HOW TO GET IT: In the grassy area south-west of Clock Town, find the butter-
flies (near the Deku Baba), then drop down into the nearby hidden grotto.
Inside is a Peahat, an enemy you may remember from Ocarina of Time. Kill him
with arrows or your sword to win a Piece of Heart. Oh? He's not attacking? He's
just sending little larva at you? Maybe he's too tired to fight, maybe he'll be
ready when he wakes up. The Sonata of Awakening didn't work? Well, try using
nature's way of waking things up: the time of day.

LOCATION: TERMINA FIELD
HOW TO GET IT: Right next to the fence blocking the way to Great Bay is another
boulder. Bomb it, then kill the Bio Deku Babas and shoot the beehives to make
a Piece of Heart fall into the water. Dive down and get it.

LOCATION: TERMINA FIELD
HOW TO GET IT: Find the juvinile Dodongo, then enter the grotto nearby. Kill
the two adult Dodongos by slashing their tails to win a Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: SWAMP SHOOTING GALLERY
HOW TO GET IT: Get a perfect score once to win a bigger quiver. Later, get
another perfect score to win a Piece of Heart. Just shoot all the deku scrubs,
then shoot the guays that appear. Be sure to hit the Wolfos (big big points!)
and the two hidden scrubs. One is in the tree on the right, the other is on the
big rock to the left.

LOCATION: DEKU PALACE
HOW TO GET IT: On the other side (the left side), a Piece of Heart is hidden in
the garden. Use the Stone Mask to help you sneak past the guards.

LOCATION: WOODFALL
HOW TO GET IT: Use the deku flowers to reach the big chest, just to the left as
you enter Woodfall.

LOCATION: SOUTHERN SWAMP
HOW TO GET IT: After restoring the swamp by defeating Odowla, talk to Koume in
the Tourist Info Shop. She'll challenge you to a target shooting game. Shoot
her target (not her!) 20 times in one round to win a Piece of Heart. FYI, my
high score is currently 38.

LOCATION: RAPID RACE
HOW TO GET IT: Beat the Beaver Brothers once to get a bottle (or 20 rupees),
then beat them both again in under 1:40 seconds to win a Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: GREAT BAY LABORATORY
HOW TO GET IT: Catch five fish (easiest way: get five bottles and fill them up
with fish from the Stock Pot Inn Kitchen, enter a room and return to the kitch-
en for more). Drop them all into the small fish tank in the Great Bay Labora-
tory. One of the fish will eat them all, and then he'll eat the other one
already there. He'll then spit out a Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: MOUNTAIN VILLAGE
HOW TO GET IT: Round up the five frogs all over Termina with Don Gero's Mask,
then conduct their song after defeating Ghot and restoring the Mountains. One
of the frogs already waits there, and another is easy to find by the Clock Town
Laundry Pool. Two are being held by the Gekkos in the Woodfall Temple and Great
Bay Temple, and you'll find the fifth sitting on a log in the Southern Swamp
after defeating Odowla (you may have noticed him during the cruise). Once all
five have been found and returned, go to the pond in the Mountain Village to
conduct their song.

LOCATION: GREAT BAY
HOW TO GET IT: First, teach the Scarecrow a song and buy a Magic Bean pod, then
go to the shore by the Pirates' Fortress (the shore with a million Like Likes).
Use the Hookshot to reach an upper ledge with some soft soil. Plant the bean
and water it to reach another ledge, then summon the Scarecrow and use the
Hookshot to reach the Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: PIRATES' FORTRESS
HOW TO GET IT: Infiltrate the Pirates' Fortress (see the WALKTHROUGH section
for details) until you reach an area without any pirates where a Piece of Heart
is locked behind a door. Break through the barrels by rolling into them, then
hit the switch. Put on the Bunny Hood and run down to the room with the Piece
of Heart inside.

LOCATION: IKANA GHOST HOUSE
HOW TO GET IT: First, I recommend getting the Great Fairy's Sword, then pay 30
rupees to try to defeat the four Poe Sisters (Joelle, Amy, Beth, and Meg). Use
the Great Fairy's Sword on the first three, then fight Meg. Meg's a bit
tougher: there's one of her, and three illusions. The real Meg is the one that
spins around once as soon as she appears (once she's solid). Hit her with the
sword or an arrow and the Piece of Heart is yours.

LOCATION: IKANA VALLEY
HOW TO GET IT: Arm yourself with the Light Arrow, the Great Fairy's Sword, a
lot of arrows, about 18 hearts (trust me), and a healing fairy or two (you may
not need the fairy, but it wouldn't hurt). Dive into the river and swim north
of the Octoroks. Behind the waterfall is a cave leading to the Secret Shrine.
Shoot a Light Arrow at the sun to open the door, then talk to the one-eyed guy.
Jump to the different tunnels to reach some mini-bosses. The tunnel on the left
leads to three Dinofols, no problem with the Great Fairy's Sword. The second
room from the left holds a Wizrobe. Use arrows against him, but this time, you
don't have the map or compass to help you. The next room has a Wart. Now
instead of using the Hookshot to remove the smaller eyeballs, you can use the
spin-attack with the Great Fairy's Sword (if you know how to do it well). The
last room holds the Master Garo. He's a lot easier now that you have the Great
Fairy's Sword. You need a lot of hearts to get in to fight him, though. Just
use the sword on him and you shouldn't have any trouble. Once all four mini-
bosses are gone and you have accumulated a whopping 400 rupees, return to the
central room to get a Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: ODOWLA MINI-DUNGEON
HOW TO GET IT: Use the Deku Mask to fly across the room to the ledge on the
right side in the back of the room to find the Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: GHOT MINI-DUNGEON
HOW TO GET IT: Using the Goron Mask, roll across the paths and bounce off the
chests. Navigate the paths to find the Piece of Heart.

LOCATION: GYORG MINI-DUNGEON
HOW TO GET IT: Using the Zora Mask, swim through the tunnels. If you find a
fork, take it, use it for dinner... j/k, bad joke. Take the following forks:
left, right, left, left. Hop out to find the Piece of Heart hiding behind the
Gossip Stone.

LOCATION: TWINMOLD MINI-DUNGEON
HOW TO GET IT: Beat the bosses to find the Piece of Heart in the last room.

|BOTTLES|
|óóóóóóó|

LOCATION: SOUTHERN SWAMP
HOW TO GET IT: Visit Kotake in the Teapot House to get a free bottle filled
with a red potion.

LOCATION: ROMANI RANCH
HOW TO GET IT: Use a Powder Keg to blast open the large rock on the first day.
Talk to Romani to make a promise to protect the ranch from "them." "They"
always come a few days before the festival, then "they" visit the cow barn and
steal the cows. Practice a few times, then wait form "them" to come. Once
"they" arrive, shoot arrows to prevent "them" from reaching the cow barn. The
best ambush spot is on top of the house. There's a laddar behind the house.
From the roof, you can shoot any of "them" that try to approach the barn. If
you run out of arrows, you can take some "left behind" by "them," or you can
break open the crate in front of the house. Once dawn arrives, "they" will
leave. If you're successful, Romani will give you a bottle filled with milk.

LOCATION: GORON RACE TRACK
HOW TO GET IT: After beating Snowhead Temple, visit the Powder Keg shop in
Goron Village to get a test keg. Take it to the Goron Race track (above Goron
Pond) by throwing it up the ramp, then rolling up to it. Carry it up to the
large rock, then BOOM. Win the race to receive a bottle with some gold powder
in it.... Maybe the Zubora the Sword Smith could use this stuff....

LOCATION: BEAVER'S GAME
HOW TO GET IT: In the area with Zora Hall, hike up the river towards the water-
fall. Use the hookshot to pull yourself up to the ledges on the cliffs (shoot
the trees). Make your way over to the cave above the waterfall. Inside lives a
pair of beaver brothers. As Mikau, follow the smaller beaver through all 20
rings. Now, follow the big brother through all 25 rings. If you complete it
both times, they'll give you their very special empty bottle.

LOCATION: MILK BAR
HOW TO GET IT: First, get Romani's mask, then follow the Kafei sequence until
you get the Express Mail to Mama. On the final day, after 6 pm, give the mail
to Madame Aroma in the Milk Bar. She'll give you a bottle full of Chateau
Romani milk.

LOCATION: GRAVEYARD
HOW TO GET IT: At night, 3rd Day, put on the Captain's Hat and talk to the
three stalchildren around the grave and order them to open the grave. Enter the
hole, then talk to DampÈ. Lead him around to the dirt piles and tell him to dig
them up. For the two up higher, lead him to the squares on the ground, then run
up to the upper platforms. Lead him to those dirt piles and tell him to dig.
Once all three blue flames have been found, DampÈ will run away and a giant Poe
will appear. Wait until it hits your shield, then shoot it with an arrow. After
about five shots, it will die and a treasure chest will appear. Open it to
receive the bottle. This may take a while, so I highly recommend playing the
Inverted Song of Time first. You only have 12 hours of game time to do this,
since it only works on Day 3. Also, to make this MUCH easier, Z-Target DampÈ
and slowly walk in the direction you want him to go. As long as you have a tar-
get lock on him, he'll follow you. If you get too far away from him, the lock
will break and he'll be lost.

HOW TO KILL IT: Best way to earn fast rupees. Wear the Stone Mask, then shoot
it with arrows to kill it. If you wear the Stone Mask, it won't steal any items

USUALLY FOUND: Northern Mountains, Snowhead Temple.
WAY IT ATTACKS: Runs around you and slashes you with its claws.
HOW TO KILL IT: Z-Target, then stab it right before it attacks (it'll block all

-*- MINI-BOSSES -*-

= GEKKO =
DESCRIPTION: A bright orange and black gecko with razor teeth.
LOCATION: Woodfall Temple, Great Bay Temple
WAY IT ATTACKS: In Woodfall, it rides atop a Snapper. In Great Bay, it uses a
large blob of green goo to trap you, then pummel you.
HOW TO KILL IT: In Woodfall, use the burrow-and-pop strategy to knock it off
the Snapper, then shoot it with the Hero's Bow. In Great Bay, attack it with
the sword or arrows, then freeze the green goo with the Ice Arrow BEFORE it
falls on top of you.

= GOMESS =
DESCRIPTION: A giant Grim-Reaper with a giant scythe.
LOCATION: Stone Tower Temple
WAY IT ATTACKS: Flies around and attacks with its giant scythe.

= MASTER GARO =
DESCRIPTION: The soul of a ninja living in a purple robe with two swords.
LOCATION: Stone Tower Temple, Ikana Shrine
WAY IT ATTACKS: Flies around and attacks with its swords.
HOW TO KILL IT: Use Bombs to attack him, or the Ice Arrow to immobilize him
(using the Ice Arrow can be tough, so get close and use the Blast Mask and
Bombs). Also, you can use the spin attack if you need to (even better if you
have the Great Fairy Sword).

= WART =
DESCRIPTION: Returning from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. A giant
eyeball surrounded by many smaller eyeballs
LOCATION: Great Bay Temple, Ikana Shrine
WAY IT ATTACKS: Slowly moves towards you, eventually releases all smaller eyes
and rolls around the room crashing into you.
HOW TO KILL IT: Use the hookshot to remove the small eyes and kill them with
your sword. Once enough of them are gone, shoot the giant eye with an arrow
when it opens. Once all the small eyes fall off, use the spin-attack to kill
them off, then use the spin attack to kill the giant eye. Another way is to
hang out in a corner, then shoot it in the eye with arrows.

= WIZROBE =
DESCRIPTION: Another returning enemy from previous Zelda games. A blue-skinned
wizard.
LOCATION: Snowhead Temple, Stone Tower Temple, Ikana Shrine
WAY IT ATTACKS: Shoots energy balls at you.
HOW TO KILL IT: Look for a small red dot on the map in the corner (only if you
have the compass, it's a lot tougher if you don't). This tells you where the
real one is coming up. Wait for him to rise and start dancing before you shoot
him with an arrow.

-*- BOSSES -*-

= ODOWLA =
DESCRIPTION: A very large jungle warrior with a huge sword. Dances and sings.
LOCATION: Woodfall Temple
WAY IT ATTACKS: Dances around the room, attacks with its huge sword, then
leaps away to dodge your attacks.
HOW TO KILL IT: Use your shield to protect yourself, then stab it in the legs
with your sword. Bombs work well too, especially against the small bugs he
sends after you.

= GHOT =
DESCRIPTION: A large mechanical monster with four legs, runs around a circualar
tunnel.
LOCATION: Snowhead Temple
WAY IT ATTACKS: Runs around, knocks stalagtites and rocks, shoots lightning
bolts, throws bombs.
HOW TO KILL IT: Transform into Darmani, then use the Goron Roll to attack it.
Only attempt to attack it once your body is spiked out. Once it collapses, keep
attacking it. Only stop once it really goes crazy and crashes.

= GYORG =
DESCRIPTION: A giant fish with a big mouth.
LOCATION: Great Bay Temple.
WAY IT ATTACKS: Grabs you in its mouth, chops on you a while, then spits you
out. Does major damage.
HOW TO KILL IT: Use Mikau's electric shield to hit it in the head. Once it's
hit once, hit it again before it recovers. Alternate strategy: stun it with
your boomerang fins, then shock it with the electric shield attack.

DESCRIPTION: Two giant insects like long caterpillars, similar to boss from A
Link to the Past in the second temple.
LOCATION: Stone Tower Temple.
WAY IT ATTACKS: Flies around and doesn't do much.

attack both monsters with your sword in the head or end of their tail.

|CHARACTERS|
|óóóóóóóóóó|

-*- MAIN CHARACTERS -*-

- LINK -
The most important character in the game (obviously) since YOU are Link (well,
actually, you're controlling Link, I don't know who you are). Link is a
courageous young boy from Kokiri Forest in the land of Hyrule. Link has plenty
of experience dealing with big ugly monsters. He's an incredible hero, but
still remains humble.

- DEKU BUTLER'S SON -
Link's smaller, wooden form, Deku Link can do many strange but useful things.
At the beginning of the game, Link can't turn himself back into his hylian form
until he recovers the Ocarina of Time and talks to the Happy Mask Salesman.
Deku Link can use a simple spin attack by pressing A, he can blow bubbles using
B, and he can fly for a short distance by burrowing into the pink flowers
(press and hold the A button, then release after the dust pops out). Deku Link
can't swim, but he can hop up to five times across the water.

- DARMANI -
Once Link gets the Goron Mask from Darmani, he can turn himself into the buff,
rock-munching goron warrior, Darmani. All the gorons recognize Darmani as the
strongest goron in the land. Press B to punch, uppercut, then butt-smash the
baddies (and that's one big goron butt). Press A to curl up, then press B to
jump, then pound. While pressing A, push on the control stick to roll around.
Build up speed, then, if you have magic, you can mow down monsters and run the
ramps once you have spikes sticking out of your body. It looks like he should
go on a diet, since all those rocks have made him heavy as a boulder. And, as
most smart people know, boulders sink in deep water. So does Darmani. And, as
most smart people know, heavy boulders, even living ones, have a tough time
jumping. So does Darmani.

- MIKAU -
After Mikau leaves you his guitar and his spirit in the form of a mask, you can
become the sleek, athletic, guitar-playing Zora himself. The control descrip-
tions are hard to explain, but easy to figure out, so I'll do my best. To sink,
(SINK SINK! you mean dive dive! oh, you're right, that is a sink... sorry,
inside joke) press B, to surface, press A. While in the water (but not walking
around on the bottom), press and hold A again to swim forward. Press R to form
an electric shield around you (when walking on the bottom, press R and B).
Press B to punch, chop, and flip-kick. Press and hold B, then release to use
your fins as boomerangs. Mikau can also jump the farthest. YAY!

- EPONA -
Link's trusty horse. He goes riding through the Lost Woods one day, looking for
Navi, when the Skull Kid steals the Ocarina of Time and rides off with Epona.
Once you can use the Powder Kegs, you can learn Epona's Song from Romani at
Romani Ranch. Use this song to call Epona from anywhere she can reach you and
she'll come galloping towards you.

- TATL -
This fairy is better than Navi in some ways, and worse in others. A lot of
people must have complained to Nintendo after Navi's repetitive "Hey! Look!
Listen! Watch out!" This fairy just goes "Ding ding ding!" to get your atten-
tion. Though this may seem like an improvement, she's not a very nice fairy,
especially compared to Navi. She used to follow the Skull Kid around, along
with her brother, Tael, helping him play tricks on people. Now, she's helping
you find the Skull Kid. Her attitude could use some improvement, and she often
assumes that you know how to defeat enemies, and then, in a rather insulting
way, says something like "Don't tell me you don't know about [insert enemy name
here]" whenever you ask for help.

- TAEL -
Tatl's little brother. He's purple colored. He cares a lot about his sister,
and will give you and Tatl a hint early on about where to find the Four Giants.

NOTE: Tatl's name is pronounced like "tattle," and Tael's name is pronounced
like the word "tale" or "tail." Why, you ask? Try saying both their names like
this in order... :-)

- SKULL KID -
Before the Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask, he was lonely, without any friends.
Then he met Tatl and Tael, two fairy siblings. The trio began playing tricks
and stealing things. Not only did they steal Link's Ocarina and his horse,
Epona, the Skull Kid also stole Majora's Mask from the Happy Mask Salesman.
The Majora's Mask, an evil, powerful mask, gave the Skull Kid incredible
powers. Using the powers of the mask, the Skull Kid caused all sorts of
problems for the inhabitants of Termina. Worst of all, he's using the power
to control the moon.... or is he?

- MAJORA'S MASK -
This evil mask was used by an ancient tribe in it's hexing rituals. It's evil
powers are extremely strong and shouldn't be underestimated.

the Room Key. How'd you have a reservation? Well, the Goron Postman's name is
Link-goro, or whatever you named your character plus -goro. Anju mistakes his

into a pint-sized younger version of the blue-haired man. Now Kafei is hiding
from the rest of the world, only coming out wearing his cherished Keaton Mask
he received from the Curiosity Shop owner. He's hanging out in the back of the
curiosity shop, through the door by the laundry pool. Your job is to help him
recover the Sun's Mask that was stolen by Sakon the Thief. He also happens to
be the son of Mayor Dotour and Madame Aroma. She'll hire you to try and find
him.

Kafei.

TIME: 1st, 2:30 - 5:15 am
You may have practiced on Epona, but it'll be easier on foot, or maybe on the
roof (what else could the ladder on the back of the house be for?). Use the
Inverted Song of Time to slow down the ghosts, then shoot them each with an
arrow. As long as you've got good aim (like me, I like to call myself ol' one-
shot) and/or a really big quiver, you shouldn't run out of arrows. Just make
sure no ghosts get inside the barn between now and dawn and you'll win. If you
do run out of arrows, then take some left behind by the ghosts or break open a
crate.

3: RECEIVE MILK BOTTLE

milk. The gate has been closed, so she'll have to take a dangerous detour
through the Gorman Race Track. Shoot the "bandits" (the Gorman Brothers) with
arrows to keep them away (you have an infinite supply, maybe Cremia has a big
stash in the wagon). Keep them away until the wagon reaches Milk Road. Cremia

long time. Nobody sees him, they all walk past like he's just another stone in
the canyon. He must be pretty hungry by now.
SCHEDULE:
            1@                        1@                        1@
|========================||========================||========================|

1: RECEIVE STONE MASK
TIME: 1st - 3rd, 6:00 am - 6:00 pm
Using the Lens of Truth, look for Shiro in the middle of the circle of stones
near the intersection leading to Ikana Graveyard. Give the poor soldier a red
or blue potion to revive him to full strength. He'll give you the stone mask
which will make you as unnoticable as a rock on the side of the road. Useful
for getting past the pirate guards and other enemies.


- GURU-GURU -
BACKGROUND: Guru-guru used to be in a group of performing animals. He stole the
mask that the group's leader used, and now he needs someone to listen to his
confession.
SCHEDULE:
                  1@                        1@                        1@ 
|------------============||------------============||------------============|

1: RECEIVE BREMEN MASK
TIME: 6:00 pm - 6:00 am
Talk to Guru-guru at the laundry pool as Link to listen to his confession. He
will give you the Bremen Mask.


-*- MINOR CHARACTERS -*-

This is the section for all the other minor characters that don't appear in the
Bombers' Notebook. The descriptions aren't very detailed, since these charac-
ters are minor. Also, if there are little -'s around a character's name, it
means they're returning from Ocarina of Time, but they're not necissarily the
same character, they just look alike. Characters with little ='s around their
name are new. Characters with -='s around their name mean they are returning,
but they're a bit different, both how they act and how they look.

-*- CHARACTER COMPARISON -*-

You should know by now that most people in this game are somewhere in Ocarina
of Time (unless, of course, you have never played Ocarina of Time, in which

village as adult Link, except the poe salesman.

-*- TEMPLE FAIRIES -*-

For now, I just have maps and really short descriptions. There are always
ways of finding them. You can use the Great Fairy's Mask to draw free fairies
to you, and when you wear it, you can tell if there are more fairies in the 
room if the hair on the mask gives off little pink sparklies. Also, there are
lots of times when fairies are hidden behind fake walls which can be found by
using the Lens of Truth. Just remember: nothing is too crazy. I noticed an
unreachable hidden ledge in the main room of Snowhead temple. At the top of the
temple was a pink deku flower. I didn't think it would work, but it did! It
lasted long enough! It took me about a full minute to drift down there, but it
worked! So just remember: try anything.

I recommend coming back once you get the hookshot so you can reach the chests
easier. Also, any time you see some snow on the wall, check it out with the
Lens of Truth. There's probably a fairy behind it.

ROOM 1.B
A fairy is trapped in a bubble in the central pillar. Pop it, then use the mask
to lure it to you.

Another trapped fairy hangs out under the platform by the stairs. Use the same
strategy.

ROOM 2.2
One fairy is easy. It's off to the side, without a bubble.

There are some hidden steps leading up to a hidden fairy in a chest just above
the stairs. Use the Lens of Truth.

ROOM 3.B
In the Basement of room 3, use Darmani to step on the switch in the middle of
the lava. Use him again to open a chest in the nearby lava pool.

ROOM 3.2
A fairy is hidden in an inaccesable alcove off to the side (use the Lens of
Truth). Up at the top of room 3 on the fourth floor (3.4), a deku flower sits
next to the door to Ghot's lair. Up until now, every deku flower has run out
after a few seconds, but that's only because you've never used them for slowing
vertical descent. As long as you don't use the control stick too much, it will
last long enough, so use it to drift down to the fairy on the second floor
(3.2). Trust me, it works. Just be sure you jump off the correct side (I was
about to type "jump off the right side," but, as you know, "right" can have
multiple meanings in English. In reality, it's to the left of Ghot's lair.

ROOM 4.1
Move the blocks over to the spot in the snow that sinks lower (as far away from
the door as possible). This will make a chest appear. Use the Hookshot to reach
it (if you don't have the hookshot, use the block in room 5.1 to reach it).

ROOM 5.1
Melt the ice and step on the switch, then use the Hookshot or the block to
reach the chest.

Push the block over to the two pillars by the stairs. Hop onto the block, jump
to the empty pillar, jump to the crate on the other one, then use Darmani to
break open the crate with a Goron Pound. You can also use the block now to
reach the fairy in room 4.1.

ROOM 6.1
Look for the snow on the wall. Use the Lens of Truth to find a chest in a small
alcove in the wall.

ROOM 7.1
The ceiling is false. Use the Lens of Truth to free a bubbled fairy.

ROOM 9.1
Defeat all three Freezards, then jump to the chest that appears.

ROOM 10.3
In yet another alcove hidden behind a false wall, a bubbled fairy waits.

ROOM 11.4
Kill the two Dinofols to win two fairies.

Now take all 15 fairies to the Fairy Fountain located in a cave at the base of
Snowhead. You'll be rewarded with an upgraded magic meter.

START ROOM
Light all the torches with the Fire Arrow to make a chest appear.

ROOM 1
Up on a ledge to the left of the door, a Skulltula holds a fairy captive.

A bubbled fairy waits underneath the doorway platform.

ROOM 2
A barrel on the left holds a fairy inside.

A pot at the bottom of the room holds a fairy. Use Mikau's boomerang fins to
break it, then the Great Fairy's Mask or a prayer to retrieve it.

ROOM 3
A jar contains a fairy.

ROOM 4
Kill all the Bio Deku Babas to make a chest appear. Hop the lily pads to reach
it.

ROOM 5
Use Mikau's boomerang fins to break the jar, then use the mask on the fairy.

ROOM 9
This is really tricky. Stand on the yellow water pump, then use the Ice Arrow
to reach the back wall (look up at the framework on top, you should see two
gaps, take the left one). Quickly use the hookshot to pull yourself up to the
framework. You'll find a chest in the center.

ROOM 12
Stop the machinery, climb onto the waterwheel, then use the Hookshot to latch
onto the chest. A fairy hides inside.

Easy to miss, there's a chest underneath one of the walkways. Use the hookshot
to latch onto the torch next to it.

ROOM 13
Another one that's very easy to miss, there's a hidden room under one of the
see-saws. Use Mikau to sink down, then roll into the barrel to free a fairy.

I'm kicking myself for not figuring this out myself. AS MIKAU, walk along the
green pipe, then climb up higher onto it, then drop down. From there, use the
Hookshot to reach the chest across the gap.

ROOM 14
Use Mikau's boomerang fin attack to pop the bubble, then use the mask out on
dry land (or would that be dry metal?).

A fairy hides under the last green switch.

Now, after getting a ton of e-mails asking where the Great Fairy Fountain is, I
have finally found in the course of proofreading this FAQ that I did, in fact,
forget to include the location of the Great Bay Fairy Fountain. I
apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

The Great Bay Fairy Fountain is on a cliff on shore. To get to it, hop along
the small islands near the beach and use the hookshot on the palm trees if you
need to. Once you reach the cliff wall, use a Bomb to enter the fairy fountain.

KEY
N=CHEST REVEALED WHILE NORMAL
L=CHEST REVEALED WHILE FLIPPED
O=OTHER (CHEST ALREADY OUT IN THE OPEN, HELD BY ENEMY, ETC.)

In Stone Tower Temple, you can easily find the fairies since MOST of them are
in treasure chests. Once you get the compass and open all the other chests, you
can easily find them. The trick is pushing the right buttons to make the chests
appear. You'll often reveal a chest, then realize its on the ceiling. You'll
have to do a lot of flipping to find all 15 fairies, but the reward is certain-
ly worth it.

REVEABLE WHILE NORMAL, ACCESSABLE WHILE NORMAL
START ROOM
Shoot the yellow eye switch to make a chest appear.

ROOM 3
Use your hookshot in the dark room to find a chest.

ROOM 4
Once you get the Light Arrow, use it on the left sun block, but don't waste
an arrow on the one on the right. Kill the Beamos, then swim over and let your-
self be thrown by the Dexihand. Throw a Bomb over the fence so that it lands
next to the crystal switch. Swim back and retrieve the fairy in the chest that
appears.

Defeat the Eyegore to win a fairy.

ROOM 6
Shine your light on the suns along the walls to make a chest appear nearby.

Shine your light on the sun block to the right (or return with the Light Arrow)
and look for the chest down the hallway.

ROOM 7
Use the deku flower to reach a small ledge on the left that holds lots of ru-
pees and a chest.

This is tricky. Transform into Darmani, pound the Goron Switch, then carefully
roll around to the extinguished switch. It may take a few tries. Once the chest
appears, fly to it using the deku flower.

ROOM 9
Hit the crystal switch, then open the chest on the floor.

REVEALABLE WHILE FLIPPED, ACCESSABLE WHILE FLIPPED

START ROOM
This is also revealable while normal. Shoot the sun in the start room to make
a chest appear near the Boss Warp Pad.

ROOM 3
Defeat the Wizrobe to reveal a chest. Use the hookshot to reach it.

REVEALABLE WHILE NORMAL, ACCESSABLE WHILE FLIPPED

ROOM 5
Sink to the bottom of the water. Use the boomerang fins to destroy the mines,
then hit the switch. When the temple is flipped, put an Elegy Dummy on the blue
switch to extinguish the flames, then fly up to the chest before the flanes
return.

ROOM 5
This may be revealable while flipped, too. Shoot a Fire Arrow at the frozen eye
switch.

REVEALABLE WHILE FLIPPED, ACCESSABLE WHILE NORMAL

START ROOM
When you step on the yellow switch in the start room, a chest appears. You'll
use it as a hookshot target to pull yourself to the platform, but don't forget
to come back for it later once the temple is back to normal.

ROOM 5
While the temple is flipped, shoot the frozen eye with a Fire Arrow. Return
as Mikau and sink down into the water to find the chest.

Take the 15 fairies to the Great Fairy of Kindness in Ikana Valley (just south
of Pamela's house) to get the biggest and best sword in the whole game: The
Great Fairy's Sword. See the ITEMS section for more details.

-*- SKULLTULA HOUSES -*-

Yep, it's those pesky Gold Skulltulas from Ocarina of Time, except this time,
they're confined to two houses, the Swamp Spider House and the Oceanside Spider
House. In each house, you must find 30 Gold Skulltulas, kill them, AND take
their Gold Skulltula Tokens that they leave behind. Once you have all 30 tokens
return to the first room to get a reward.

First of all, I'll give you a huge tip that you may or may not want to follow:
skip this whole place until you have the hookshot, it will be SO much easier.
I just waited until I got the Hookshot and thought to myself "How would that
have been possible without the Hookshot?" Well, it is possible, but it's MUCH
easier if you return with the Hookshot. For now, I'll assume you have the
Hookshot and give instructions accordingly. The prize isn't really all that
necessary (the Mask of Truth), so it's best to come back with the Hookshot.
Also, forgive the crudity of the maps, they're kinda confusing. The little ='s
are places on the second level if you didn't figure that out already. The ='s
on the lower level show places where you can't go, since it's only on the upper
level, and ='s on the second floor show where you can go without falling down
to the lower level. One last thing: bring lots and lots of bottles. You'll need
them. There are many dirt holes in here, and some of them hold a Gold Skulltula
just like in Ocarina of Time. Also, you'll either need a bean pod, the Bunny
Hood, or the Zora Mask.

One final tip that applies to both Skulltula houses: you can always tell if
there are more skulltulas in the room if you hear them scratching and scraping
and clanking (if you played Ocarina of Time, you'll recognize the sound).

ROOM 1.1
A Skulltula is hiding in a pot just to the left of the entrance.

There are two patches of dirt on the walls. Catch two bugs and release them
nearby. The bug will multiply into three, and all three will crawl into the
hole, releasing a Skulltula.

A Skulltula crawls up and down one of the pillars. Use the hookshot.

Another Skulltula is in the pond somewhere.

ROOM 2.1
Two Skulltulas are hiding in two of the beehives. Shoot them until two of them
have fallen to the floor (on the map, they're shown on the 2nd Floor, but you
have to kill them on the 1st Floor).

Roll into all the pots to knock out two more.

Behind the sleeping Deku Scrub is a curtain of ivy. Cut it down to find a
hidden alcove.

Smash the small jars to find another Skulltula.

ROOM 2.2 (To reach it, play the Sonata of Awakening for the Deku Scrub to make
him leave, then use the Deku Flower to reach the upper level)

Use the Hookshot on the Skulltula on the wall.

ROOM 1.2
Release some bugs near the dirt patch near the wall closest to the entrance.

Use the Hookshot to get the Skulltula out of reach above the door to Room 4.

Use the pink flower to reach the other side, then find another Skulltula
waiting on the pillar closest to the door to Room 4.

ROOM 3.2
There's a Skulltula to the right of the entrance.

Another Hookshot job waits in the center of the room.

ROOM 3.1 (jump down to the lower level)
Use your Hookshot to reach one too high to reach.

Two more are hiding in the crates. Use a roll attack to break them open and
retrieve the Skulltulas.

ROOM 4.2 (to reach it, use the Deku Flower in room 3.1 and take the upper door
to room 4.2)

Grab one hiding behind the pillar to your right as soon as you enter.

Use the Hookshot to reach two more, one above the hallway leading to Room 5,
and another on the wall on the other side of the room.

Shoot down the beehive.

To reach room 5.2, first hit the crystal switch to make the ladder appear. If
you don't have the Bunny Hood or the Zora Mask, go back into room 1.1 and get
some spring water, unless you already know the Song of Storms. Return to room
4.2 and plant some Magic Beans in the soft soil. Water it, then hop on to reach
the tunnel to room 5.2. If you have the Bunny Hood or the Zora Mask, put one on
to increase your jumping distance, then just jump to the hallway leading to
room 5.2.

ROOM 5.2
Two skulltulas are hiding in the grass. Wander around through the grass until
you find them.

Shoot down another beehive.

THREE Skulltulas are hiding in the tree. Roll into the tree to knock them down.

- Now return to the front room to find that the poor cursed Skulltula man is
back to normal! He'll give you the Mask of Truth, which you can use to read
Gossip Stones and listen to the thoughts of doggies.

Map © 2000 Bedman

The Oceanside Spiderhouse requires the Goron Mask, the Fire Arrow, the Hookshot
(duh) and it helps if you have the Captain's Hat (it gets you an extra piece of
heart). You should also only do this on the first day, since you won't get any
reward unless you do it on the first day. The reward? A Giant Wallet! Also, if
you have the Captain's Hat, you can talk to the Stalchildren to find out what
order to shoot the colored masks in room 4.B to reach a heart piece in room
5.B (POH = Piece Of Heart)

START ROOM
Bomb the wall to reach room 1.

ROOM 1.1
Use the Hookshot to reel in the first two Gold Skulltula tokens.

Burn the webbing on the ceiling to reach the third. Shoot it with your Hookshot
and pull in the token.

ROOM 2.1
A Skulltula is crawling back and forth on the rafter. Bring it down with the
Hookshot.

Another is hanging out above the stairs.

Burn the webbed-up vase in the corner (the one in a group of four), then roll
into the vases on the far left and far right to get two more.

LIBRARY
Move the Card Catalog (*gasp* a card catalog?? *faints*) out of the way to
find a long hole in the wall. Use the hookshot.

Shoot down the painting near the card catalog.

Move the bookcase next to the wall out of the way to reach two more.

Back near the Card Catalog, climb up the bookshelf that has some books missing.
From here, shoot the Skulltula between the wall and the ceiling.

Jump across the tops of the bookshelves to reach the other side. Knock down the
painting and shoot the Skulltula in the long hole in the wall.

Jump over to the bookcases in the corner to find the last one in the Library.

ROOM 2.B (take the stairs in room 2.1)
Get on the stairs to reach an out-of-reach Skulltula in between the wall and
the ceiling.

Roll into the vase next to the door leading to room 4.B.

Burn the webs covering the boxes in the corner, then smash the jar on top.

Burn another web on the wall to reveal another long hole in the wall.

To the left of the door leading to room 3.B, wait for the Skulltula to crawl
out from behind the mask, then get it.

ROOM 3.B (burn the web covering the door)
Smash a box near the right wall (to your right when you enter, see map).

Climb the boxes on the far wall and shoot the Skulltula behind the boats.

Stay on the boxes and burn the webs to find another.

Smash the box on the other wall to reveal a small alcove. Enter to find a
Skulltula.

Climb the big pile of boxes, then look around (especially up) to find a Hook-
shot target. Latch onto it to pull yourself up to the loft. A Skulltula hides
in one of the pots.

ROOM 4.B
Wait for the Skulltula in between the floor and the ceiling to crawl out from
behind the web, or waste a Fire Arrow to burn it.

One of the painings hides a Skulltula (see map)

The vase on the far left holds a spider. Roll into it.

Turn into Darmani, then do a Goron Pound on the table to knock the three Skull-
tulas off the chandelier.

If it's still the First Day, return to the first room and talk to the man.
He'll give you the Giant Wallet.

-*- THE GILDED SWORD -*-

The Gilded Sword is the second most powerful sword in the game. There are a
few steps you need to take in order to get this golden sword:

The first three steps can be skipped if you have already accomplished them. If
you haven't, be sure you have before you begin the 2nd Three Day Sequence.

1ST 3-DAY SEQUENCE:
ACQUIRE THE ADULT'S WALLET BY DEPOSITING 200 RUPEES AT THE BANK
DEFEAT GHOT IN SNOWHEAD TEMPLE
TAKE POWDER KEG CERTIFICATION TEST

2ND 3-DAY SEQUENCE:
UPGRADE YOUR KOKIRI SWORD
DEFEAT GHOT
BLAST OPEN THE RACETRACK
WIN THE RACE
TALK TO THE SMITHY

- ACQUIRE THE ADULT'S WALLET -
All you need to do to get this is deposit 200 rupees at the Clock Town Bank.
The Banker will then give you the Adult's wallet, which allows you to carry up
to 200 rupees. Make sure you leave at least 150 rupees inside your account.

- DEFEAT GHOT IN SNOWHEAD TEMPLE -
Enter and complete Snowhead Temple. Use Darmani's roll attack to defeat Ghot.
Once you have his remains, that's all you need.

- TAKE THE POWDER KEG CERTIFICATION TEST -
After defeating Ghot and thawing the mountains (or by using the Fire Arrow),
find the Bomb Shop in Goron Village. Take the Powder Keg to the Goron racetrack
located above Goron Pond (the area with three islands in between Goron Village
and Snowhead). Throw the keg up the ramps, then roll up to it, then repeat to
get it outside, then carry it to the track to bust it open. If it's later than
Day 1, just return to the Bomb Shop and talk to the Medigoron inside. Now, you
are certified to carry Powder Kegs.

NOW PLAY THE SONG OF TIME TO RETURN TO DAY ONE
From here, you MUST follow the instructions to get the Gilded Sword. You must
start this on Day 1.

- UPGRADE YOUR KOKIRI SWORD -
Withdraw 150 rupees from your account, then buy a Powder Keg from the goron in
the Bomb Shop, then go to the Mountain Smithy in the Mountain Village (the log
cabin). Talk to him and pay him 100 rupees to upgrade your Kokiri Sword up to a
Razor Sword. You may need to use the Fire Arrow to thaw the forge. Don't rest
now, there's lots more to do.

- DEFEAT GHOT -
Since you've already defeated Ghot once, it will go quicker this time. Play the
Goron Lullaby to get past the giant goron, then climb up to Snowhead Temple.
Step into the blue light to be warped directly to Ghot. Beat him again, then
return to Goron Pond. Use your Powder Keg to blast it open.

- WIN THE RACE -
After blasting open the racetrack, enter the race and win. Easier said than
done. Just keep on rolling and break the green jars to refill your magic. Try
to avoid the other racers, they can knock you off course, into a wall, and ruin
your roll, forcing you to build up your speed again. Avoid the ramps unless
you're spiked out. If you win, you'll get another bottle, filled with Prime
Gold Dust.

- TALK TO THE SMITHY -
If it's not the 2nd Day yet, wait until it is (or play the Song of Double Time)
and then return to the Mountain Smithy. Your sword should be ready by now, so
take it. Admire it, then turn back around and talk to him again. Let him take
the gold dust and your sword (again). Wait another day and return to receive
the Gilded Sword!

NOTE: To get the Gilded Sword, you need to have your Kokiri Sword upgraded to
the Razor Sword. The Razor Sword doesn't last, so make sure you have it by Day
2, or else it won't work. When you play the Song of Time, you will lose the
Razor Sword, but once you have the gilded sword and you play the Song of Time,
you'll have it forever and you won't be able to use the Kokiri Sword ever
again.

-*- ANJU & KAFEI -*-

This is the most complicated side mission ever! It will take up more than 1
three-day cycle to get everything done, since there's more than one way to do
it. The whole thing involves five Bombers' Notebook characters and will get you
four new masks, a bottle, and a Piece of Heart. Here's a bare-bones list of
what to do and when to do it. Events marked with a * must be done in the same
3-Day sequence. Events marked with a ** must be done in the same 3-Day sequence
to finally reunite the two lovers (meaning to get the final mask, you must do
all the ** things in the same 3-day sequence, but items with a * aren't re-
quired for the final mask, but must be done in the same 3-day sequence).

              ROOM 1      ROOM 3     ROOM 5

The basic strategy is to use Kafei in the lower rooms (1,3, and 5) to step on
the blue switch, which will allow Link to enter his next room. Once Link de-
feats all the enemies in that room, Kafei's next door will open. This is highly
confusing if you're just reading this, but you'll understand when you're play-
ing it. You can press START in each room to pause after seeing what it looks
like, then my descriptions will be clearer. The camera position will stay the
same for all six rooms, so this is roughly what it looks like from above.

Here goes!

In the first area, you'll see the Sun's Mask. Kafei will hop on the blue 
switch to try and retrieve it. Of course, the switch also starts a conveyor
belt which will slowly pull the mask towards the hole at the number 9 in the
very last room. The goal is to get both Link and Kafei onto the switches at B8
and B9. So, first put Link onto B1 to open the door D1. Leave Link there and
now you will control Kafei. As Kafei, grab Block L1 and push it onto B2. This
will open the door D2, allowing Link to enter his first room. Now use Link to
enter Room 2 and defeat all the enemies (E3) to open D3. Now take Kafei into
Room 3. DON'T step on the RR (red switches). Leave Kafei on B4 and take Link
into Room 4. Defeat the E5 enemies to open D5. Take Kafei into Room 5. Push
block L2 DOWN, then pull block L3 to the LEFT (onto the yellow switch). Run
down to block L4 and push it DOWN onto switch B6. Now take Link into Room 6.
Defeat the enemies to open the door at D7. To reach it, push block L5 DOWN.
Enter, then put Kafei on B8. Now take Link through the door and step on switch
B9 to close the door to the hole. The Sun's Mask is safe! Warp back to town and
go to the Employees Only room. Wait there for Kafei to get the Couple's Mask
(trust me, as long as Anju is there and you saved the Sun's Mask, he'll show
up, though he may not get there until 5 am).

|GLITCHES, TIPS, CHEATS, TWEAKS, ETC.|
|óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó|

-*- BOMBABLE WALLS -*-

To find out if a wall can be bombed, hit it with your sword. If it can be
bombed, it will make a unique sound. Most walls make a THONG noise when you hit
them, but bombable walls will make a TWAING sound. The only real use for this
is to test a wall before you waste a Bomb on it. Note that this doesn't count
for walls and stones that can only be broken by a Powder Keg.

-*- EASY RUPEES -*-

- TAKKURI -

The easiest way to get rupees. THIS IS SO EASY!!! You need either Epona or the
Stone Mask (see the MASKS section for details). Head south from Clock Town
until you reach the entrance to Milk Road. Flying around this area is Takkuri,
a kleptomaniac bird who loves to steal your items and rupees. Make sure you
put on the Stone Mask or get on Epona before approaching Takkuri. Shoot him
with arrows (I like using Fire Arrows, but you don't need to). Sometimes, when
you shoot him, he may drop about three rupees. Don't bother with this chicken
feed, just keep shooting him. Once he finally falls and dies, he'll leave be-
hind a giant gold rupee worth 200 rupees! This is the quickest way to fill up
your bank account to get a Piece of Heart.

- DODONGOS -

This is another easy way to get 50 rupees, but it's only good during the day.
North of Clock Town are two dodongos, who will each give you 50 rupees when you
kill them (there's another pair in the secret grotto). To kill the dodongos, Z-
target them, then run around to their back and jump-attack their tale. Immedi-
ately raise your shield as he turns towards you. While he's busy building up
some fire for you, run back around to his tail and jump-attack it again. Once
he finally dies, run like heck away from him and wait for him to blow up. Run
back to find a purple rupee.

- BLUE BUBBLES -

This really only works at night, just east of Clock Town, and only once you get
the Light Arrow. It also helps if you have the Stone Mask. At night, Shoot the
Blue Bubbles with Light Arrows to get 50 rupees each. Simple. Once you have 200
rupees, it might be easier to buy a Chateau Romani from the Milk Bar (after 10
pm). Drinking this will give you unlimited magic until you play the Song of
Time. This way, you can shoot all the Light Arrows you want and you only have
to worry about running out of arrows.

- TREASURE CHESTS -

There are about four treasure chests in Clock Town containing 100 rupees each.
Two of them can be reached easily, but the other two are a bit more difficult.
One of them is located in East Clock Town. Using the Bunny Hood or the Zora
Mask, climb the stairs behind the Milk Bar (the ones that lead to the roof of
the Bar). From there, jump across to the stone ledge just past the exit to Ter-
mina Field (you must use the Bunny Hood or the Zora Mask). From there, jump to
the basket above the entrance to Honey & Darling's, then jump to the roof of
the Town Shooting Gallery. Hop up, then run south, then west to find a chest
containing a silver rupee. Another chest is located in the sewer leading to the
Observatory. As soon as you reach the water (coming from Clock Town), jump in
and swim left. Swim past the Skulltula, then climb into the small alcove. Bomb
the wall (the cracked one), then open the chest. The other two chests are lo-
cated in the Stock Pot Inn. To get one of them, you need the key to the Knife
Chamber (the locked room upstairs). You can only get it on the first day by
talking to Anju at the Front Desk in the afternoon. Tell her you have a reser-
vation, then take the key upstairs and enter the Knife Chamber. Inside is a
chest with another silver rupee. The other chest is in the Employee's Only room
(Anju's bedroom). You can only enter it after midnight on the Final Day.

-*- GLITCHES -*-

They really should've bug-tested this game a LOT more. It has some really
obvious glitches that any bug tester should have found. Of course, whenever you
change the person being controlled in the middle of the game, there are going
to be some glitches that need to be worked out. There are quite a few glitches
that can be done in Sakon's Hideout when control switches from Link to Kafei.
And of course, if you have a special character that the main character can
transform into only in the boss rooms, someone is GOING to find a way to use
him outside of boss rooms, which then leads to even more glitches. It's kinda
like the glitch in Ocarina of Time where you save at Ganon after loosing your
sword, which leads to the ability to use C-items while riding Epona, which
leads to using the hookshot to pull yourself off of Epona but tricks the game
into thinking your still riding Epona.... It just goes on and on.

- FALL THROUGH THE STAIRS -

I don't know why I'm bothering to put this in here, but I'm sure that if I
don't, some newbie will e-mail me saying "Hey, wow, I've found a glitch that
you don't have!" Actually, it's so boring that I never bothered to put it in.
There are a couple of ways to do this. One way is to get onto the roof of the
Town Shooting Gallery (near the chest with the silver rupee). From there, jump
off right next to the wooden wall onto the stairs. You'll fall through the
stairs and warp to South Clock Town. The other way to do this is to use the
Deku Flower in South Clock Town and fly over to the stairs leading to West
Clock Town. Once the flower runs out (or once you push A), you'll fall through
the stairs and warp to West Clock Town. No logical use except that it's kinda
funny to see Link fall through the stairs.

- GIANT MASK SPASTIC LINK GLITCH -

To do this, enter Sakon's Hideout on day three (use the glitch below to help).
Put on a mask (best if you don't use the Keaton Mask), then when control
switches to Kafei, pause and set the Giant Mask to the same C button that the
mask you were wearing was set to. Now, when control returns to Link, you'll see
Link put on the Giant's Mask, blue light will appear like a halo around Link's
head, and he'll go all spastic like he's transforming. The game will freeze and
the only way out is to shut off the N64.

- ENTER SAKON'S HIDEOUT EARLY -

This is easy. YOU CAN ROLL THROUGH SAKON'S UNBREAKABLE DOOR! You can roll right
through the crack on the right side if you do it right. You might fall down and
land in some water. If this happens, you'll be returned to the canyon. Stop N
Swop claims the Triforce of Time is down there, but nobody should ever listen
to Stop N Swop because Stop N Swop can't even get past the stumps at the begin-
ning of the game. Thankfully, Stop N Swop has been banned from the GameFAQs
Message Boards. Anyway, as soon as you roll through, Link will make a sound
like he's hopping. Push left on the control stick to prevent him from falling
into the water below.

- FIERCE DIETY LINK OUTSIDE -

This only works on Day 3 and it helps if you can do the above glitch. Do this
early in the morning for the most time. Roll through the stone door into
Sakon's Hideout. Put on a mask (other than the Keaton Mask) and make sure the
Fierce Diety's Mask isn't set to a C item. Now, when control switches to Kafei,
set the Fierce Diety's Mask to the same C button that the mask you were wearing
was assigned to. When control returns to Link, he'll transform into Fierce
Diety Link. Now finish the hideout and leave. Jump in the river and swim south
to reach the Southern Swamp. From there you can get to Termina Field. Have fun!

NOTE: There are many glitches that go along with this glitch. If you talk to
certain people in Clock Town, the game freezes, etc. Explore at your own risk.

- STOP THE WATERWHEEL -

NOTE: THIS DOESN'T STOP THE CURRENT, IT ONLY STOPS THE WHEEL. YOU CANNOT STOP
THE CURRENT IN ANY WAY, YOU CAN ONLY REVERSE IT!

I can't believe this wasn't found in bug-testing. In the Great Bay Temple, go
through any door in the temple (other than the very first one) and then return
to the first room (the one with lots of geysers and the waterwheel). Stop all
the geysers that are making the waterwheel turn so that it stops. Now transform
into Darmani and hop in the water. 'Nuff said.

- SPASTIC BUNNY HOOD -

Okay, yes, I got this from Anju's Glitch FAQ, but this is just too funny to
leave out. It's not really useful, but I found it funny. In the Milk Bar, play
the Ballad of the Windfish with all four instruments, then put on the Bunny
Hood. Talk to Toto (the zora) and go up on stage. Stand under the spotlight and
you'll replay the song. After that, you'll become SUPER SPASTIC BUNNY!!! For
some reason, you'll run about four times faster than normal now. This wears off
once you leave the Milk Bar, but still, it's really funny to watch Link run
around the Milk Bar at super spastic speed :->

- FISH OUT OF WATER -

If you catch a fish in a bottle and then release it into the big tank in the
Great Bay Laboratory, it will swim OUT of the tank and float through the air to
the smaller tank. It will then stay right next to the tank, floating in mid-air
and flapping it's fins trying to get it. I don't know about you, but if I were
a fish, I'd want to stay away from that tank, not get inside it.

- SOME KINDA MATRIX RIP-OFF PART II -

I got this off of the MM message boards at GameFAQs a while ago and I haven't
tried it. If you can manage to jump off a ledge in Ikana and get frozen by a
Gibdo while in mid-air, it looks like it goes into bullet-time while Link stays
frozen in mid-air.

|OTHER STUFF|
|óóóóóóóóóóó|

This is a bunch of other stuff that may or may not be related to Majora's Mask,
but is most likely related to this FAQ somehow.

-*- BEDMAN'S SWEET HOME -*-

I was thinking, last night, at 2:21 AM about how I don't have my own Sweet Home
thing like Armagetz does. This may seem random, unnecessary, and like I just
stuck this here to take up memory, but if Dallas can cheat and add hundreds of
little ='s and +'s and -'s to make his FAQ look bigger, I can show everyone how
much this FAQ affects my life (and how hard it is to write a 300 KB + solid-
text guide for Majora's Mask). Here's a day (actually, more like three) that
was quite unusual, and would've been better if it weren't for this FAQ! I still
enjoy writing it, though. Also note that some of the times may be off a little, 
and it's a little longer than I expected, but it's funny!

-*- E-MAIL -*-

Preferred Majora's Mask e-mail: bedman@mail.com
PLEASE put Majora's Mask in the Subject line! NO SPAM!!! Don't send me porn
offers or you will be sorry!!! >:-(

Read this before you e-mail me with anything not related to Majora's Mask.

A while ago, I got the following e-mail in my mailbox. I obviously censored out
a lot. If I hadn't, CJayC may not let me put this up, it's pretty much X rated:

[START OF E-MAIL]

This Is Kind Of A Test And If You Got One Of Them It Would Be 1 Point Send Me

Remember Send Me Your Answers Back

[END OF E-MAIL]

You can be sure I sent my answer back: zero points, and glad about it. This is
a perfect example of the kind of e-mail I don't want to see in my mailbox. I
totally love getting questions, comments, praise, constructive criticism, etc.
about Majora's Mask, or any of my other FAQs. I don't even mind getting some-
thing not related to Majora's Mask (usually). I just don't want anything dis-
gusting (like this), insulting to ANYONE, insulting anything I believe in (like
Christianity), or anything bad, gross, disgusting, dumb, stupid, etc. The same
goes for AOL instant messages (see next section for details).

- AOL INSTANT MESSAGES -
AIM USERNAMES: NathanDale7
               USJokerBedman

DO NOT SEND ME ANY SPAM!!! I WILL SEND ALL SPAM THAT I RECEIVE TO
TOSSPAM@AOL.COM AND THEY WILL DEAL WITH IT!!! IF YOU ARE WITH AOL AND YOU SEND
ME SPAM, I WILL FORWARD YOUR MAIL TO TOSEMAIL1@AOL.COM AND YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE
YOUR AOL ACCOUNT REVOKED!!!

Many people are sending me Instant Messages (one person was from Scotland!). I
love getting instant messages, but keep some things in mind:

1: Your question may already be answered in my FAQ.
2: If I am online, I may not be for long. If I'm online during the afternoon,
morning, or early evening, I may have to log off soon (I don't like holding up
thephone line). The best time is after 10:00 pm when I usually go online
(though not for long, now that school is starting up again soon). Other than
that, I'm probably just checking my mail, checking neopets.com, etc. You can
still send me an Instant Message, just don't take your time and be prepared for
me to log off. If I do, then you can see if your question is answered in the
FAQ, or you can e-mail me and I'll get back to you soon.
3: Don't ever do anything like the person who sent the above e-mail (also,
don't insult me, ANYONE, anything I believe, etc.) Do NOT send any bad swear
words through Instant Messages or I will notify AOL. I don't really mind,
it's just that I'd rather not have anybody else see that kind of stuff.

Also, I'm in the Pacific Time Zone, just to let you know. I've gotten a lot of
people asking me "Why are you up so late?" or something. It's a little after
10 pm here, and for them, it's a little after 1 am :) Then there's my friend in
Scotland who will wake up and come online when it's 2:30 am for me, and he'll
go to bed at 4:00 pm for me....

- MAJORA'S MASK THREE-DAY CHALLENGE -

I read about this on the GameFAQs message board and it sounds very interesting.
You can't really do this very well with any other zelda game. So far, only
four people have been able to accomplish this amazing feat of skill, knowledge,
and incredible speed. Here's the challenge: beat Majora in six days. "That's
easy," you say. "Six times twenty four is 144 hours to play through the game,
right?" Wrong. You must beat Majora in six TERMINIAN days. Obviously, you
have to wait until night of the third day to get the Ocarina of Time back, but
can you beat all four bosses and the final boss in one single sitting and in
only three Terminian days? Yes. You can. Because three people so far have ac-
complished it. Also, I highly recommend taping this feat on video tape (only
tape the second three day sequence, don't bother taping the first three days
since those don't count much). Most people won't believe you unless you have
video proof to back it up.

But you're probably saying "It's impossible! You can't get to Epona on the
first day because you'd have to beat both Odowla and Ghot before 6 pm." No you
don't. Here's how to do it:

- Before you attempt this, practice practice practice! You must know all of the
  dungeons better than Shigeru Miyamoto does. You must personally introduce
  yourself to each individual pixel.
- Ignore anything not crucial in getting to Majora. This includes side-quests,
  unnecessary masks, getting dungeon maps / compasses, exploring, etc. You
  should get three bottles for the eggs, though. You should also do enough of
  the Anju-Kafei sequence to get the free Chateau Romani and extra bottle.
  Also, you can't get the FD Mask because you can't get all 20 masks in time.
- You MUST use the Inverted Song of Time to slow down time.
- Don't forget to buy Bombs, deku sticks, and any other essential items before
  you begin.

- Start a new game and go through the first three day sequence, then use the
  Song of Time ONLY ONCE to return to Dawn of the First Day. From here, you
  cannot use the Song of Time any more. You must do the entire game in three
  days.
- Immediately run and get the Red Potion and give it to Koume. Run to the Deku
  Palace and learn the Sonata of Awakening. Quickly make your way to Woodfall
  Temple.
- Get the Hero's Bow, then get out of there.
- Break through the ice to get to Snowhead.
- Talk to the Goron Baby.
- Get the Lens of Truth.
- Follow Darmani, get the Goron Mask, get hot water, thaw the elder, learn the
  Lullaby Intro.
- Learn the Goron Lullaby, enter Snowhead.
- Get Fire Arrows, then skip Ghot and return to the Goron Village and become
  powder keg certified.
- Return to Clock Town at some point at the right time and arrange to meet
  with Anju at night. Go to Milk Road and bomb the boulder, then get Epona.
  THIS MUST BE DONE BEFORE 6 PM ON THE FIRST DAY!
- Then you must use Epona to get to the graveyard, get the Captain's Hat, then
  enter the grave and learn the Song of Storms.
- After that, return and beat Odowla and Ghot, and don't forget to meet with
  Anju, then mail her letter. You should also teach the scarecrow a song.
- Get the bottle by winning the goron race.
- Get the Zora Mask, then gather all the eggs at the Pirates' Fortress (don't
  forget to get the Stone Mask to make it go faster).
- Once you have the hookshot and the Scarecrow Song, get the bottle from the
  Beaver Brothers.
- Show the picture to the fisherman, then get the three remaining eggs from
  Pinnacle Rock.
- Learn the New Wave Bossa Nova, then enter the Great Bay Temple.
- Beat Gyorg, then return and talk to Kafei. Later, get the letter from the
  Curiosity Shop owner and deliver it to Madame Aroma to get the Chateau
  Romani.
- Go to Ikana and get the Mirror Shield and learn the Elegy of Emptiness.
- Enter the Stone Tower Temple and beat Twinmold using the Chateau Romani.
- Immediately warp back to town and climb the stairs in the Clock Tower.
- Go to the moon and don't bother with the mini-dungeons since you don't have
  the masks. Defeat Majora.

This can't be done easily. It is very challenging, but it can be done. Anyone
can do it with enough practice (except Stop N Swop). Don't forget to video tape
the whole thing. It will probably take about six hours, so use a blank video
tape. If the tape runs out, immediately pause the game and switch tapes. If you
accomplish this, e-mail me and let me know and I'll add your name to the list.
You can also post it on the MM Message Board at GameFAQs and I'm sure many
people will give you praise (and maybe some doubts). I wish you luck.

By the way, I have not yet done this myself, but I will probably try to do it
someday. Wish me luck too.

rules.

1.4 12-4-00 - Added to walkthrough, masks nearly complete, added CHARACTERS
section. Added SIDE MISSIONS section. Reformatted walkthrough slightly, set max
line width to 79 characters instead of 80 :(, don't ever try this at home

1.5 12-18-00 - Added Woodfall Temple walkthrough, a week late since I spent all
weekend getting ready for Christmas :). Redrew the Majora's Mask at the top of

add Pieces of Heart and other side missions, and a few more things. Feel free
to e-mail me if you have any questions (or for any other reason)! Also, if you
really want to, you can now e-mail me to ask me if you want to post this
elsewhere.

(-: THIS FAQ IS FINALLY DONE ENOUGH! MORE UPDATES LATER, OF COURSE :-)

2.1 12-31-00 - Goodbye 2000! Hello new millenium! YES, this IS the start of the
new millenium (assuming we've been keeping correct count of the years). Never
mind. Added a Price List. THE PIECES OF HEART ARE FINALLY DONE! Of course,
I'll still add more Keaton Questions and the descriptions on how to get the
Pieces of Heart on the Moon, but I'll probably wait until I get more e-mails...
c'mon people, I wrote a FAQ for Majora's Mask and you're not e-mailing me
enough! Keep 'em coming! Speaking of e-mails, I also added the e-mail section.
In other5 news, my keyboard is starting to go wonky, s\o don't be surpri5s\ed
if the5res\ a bunch of junk s\omewhere (like an extra s, \, r, 5, q, or d).
It's a laptop, so I can't 5really get a new keyboa5rdq. I do always go back and
edit anything I typed to make sure there5's nothing there that shouldn't be.
I also added the MINOR CHARACTERS to the CHARACTERS section, and the GILDED
SWORD to the SIDE MISSIONS section.

2.11 1-4-01 - Added warning about the Hybris virus that I was infected with,
possibility that the virus spread from my computer after I was infected. I
wanted to get info about the Hybris virus (hahaha@sexyfun.net) out ASAP. Also
contains work in progress on version 2.2, since I've added stuff since my last
update (2.1). Basically, between 2.1 and 2.2, I have done some work on 2.2, but
I added info on the virus and submitted it without proofreading it.

2.2 1-17-01 - The 01's! (year-wise, not version number-wise). Added a Frequent-
ly Asked Questions section (I'd call it FAQ, but that would be a bit confusing)
after getting about four e-mails asking "How do i get epona" (notice the lower-
case initial letter of a proper noun... j/k :). Began adding the maps for
each different area, didn't get very far. Fixed a problem in the Pieces of
Heart section (two descriptions of the mailbox thing and added missing descrip-
tion about the Doggy Racetrack). Fixed a few things here and there. Added note
about Spam to e-mail address at the top and also in the e-mail section. Added
the TIPS, HINTS, CHEATS, TWEAKS, ETC. section, and also corrected the day of
the week for the Curiosity Shop meeting in the Anju / Kafei guide. Thank you
Sicarius!

3.0 1-30-01 - Added some nifty smilies :-ﬁ ¶-) If you want to use these symbols
you can just highlight them and press Ctrl C to copy them, then Ctrl V to paste
them. Also added a Width guide at the end of the FAQ. ADDED MOON INFO AND
FIERCE DEITY'S MASK INFO!!! WALKTHROUGH IS COMPLETE!!! VERSION 3.0!!! If you're
wondering why I'm numbering these wierd, then here's why: I don't think it
makes any sense to use decimals if you're just going to make little updates and
big updates increase by .1 every time. If I increased by 1 every time, the num-
ber would be too big. This way, if it increases by .1, you can tell that it's a
small update, and if it updates up to a nice round number, it means I made a
very large or very important update.

Also in 3.0, I fixed some graphics by adding characters like ó and Ø to help
make them look better. I also added some cool glitches. Totally rewrote the
Under the Well section. Fixed a few things here and there.

3.1 6-1-01 - It's been too long... updated a few things like e-mail,
WHquestion, neopets, etc. Added a few things to make it 300k... It was when I
sent v3.0, but with the zipping and unzipping, it must have come up as 299k on
CJayC's computer. Fixed some errors caused by faulty floppy disk.

3.2 2-9-02 - Proofread ENTIRE document >_< and fixed a few words here and
there, updated a few things, added more to FAQ section (yeah for more e-mail!).
Added Majora's Mask Three-Day challenge. Added submitted artwork. Updated
several sections after playing MM a second time, causing a major delay.

Total number of spelling and grammatical errors found so far: 17

3.3 7-26-02 - Fixed a few things after finishing second MM game. Added "Some
Kinda Matrix Rip-off Part II" to glitch section, look for part I coming soon...
Also added e-mail note after major freezing problem arises.

QUOTED SENTANCE: "Use the Bremen Mask... at Romani Ranch to make [the
chicks] grow older."

(note: this is only an example. I can't see why anyone would want to quote it
like this, but it's only an example)

If you want to replace a word with your own, be sure to put brackets [] around
the new word. If you want to omit text (leave stuff out), put little elipsis,
like... or . . . where the omitted text used to be. Also, be sure to place
quote marks "" around quotations, and be sure to give me credit! See the above
section for details about giving me credit.

Also, if I happen to mispell a word or make some obvious grammatical error,
first, e-mail me at bedman@mail.com and tell me the exact location of the
error (section, paragraph, sentence if possible). If you want to quote text
and I've misspelled something in the quotation, put (sic) after it. This is
a latin word usually used to show that something is wrong or misspelled in the
text that was quoted.

-*- Armagetz for daring me to write a Majora's Mask FAQ (I still haven't gotten
    hundreds of e-mails!).
-*- Nintendo for making this deeeeep game.
-*- Shigeru Miyamoto for creating Zelda and Link (if you care, that's probably
    pronounced shee-geh-rdoo mee-ah-moh-toh, don't even try pronouncing that
    "rdoo" sound unless you know Japanese, just pronounce it as "roo").\
-*- Un-thank you to Shigeru Miyamoto for screwing up the GameCube Zelda game!!!
    If you want my thanks back, then change Zelda GCN back to how it was! You
    aren't getting any thanks from me ever again unless you change it back! You
    ruined my life!!! Baka! Baka baka baka!!! Baka yaro! Kuso desu yo! I'll
    never buy another Zelda game ever again!!! Un-thank you so much!!! >:-(
-*- All the programmers who worked hard to make this game (I know how hard
    programming games can be, even on a Texas Instruments calculator!).
-*- The people / person who translated this game (I want to be a game trans-
    later when I grow up!).
-*- Dallas for motivating me to make my FAQ bigger than yours :-ﬁ
-*- AOL for providing free internet trials. Weekly updates would not have been
    possible without them!
-*- I would now like to un-thank AOL for allowing so much spam to be sent to my
    address, overcharging us, and sending us piles of free trial disks that we
    now use as coasters. Un-thank you so much!!! >:-)
-*- I'd also like to thank Armagetz (again) for daring me to write this FAQ. I
    never would've done this if you hadn't dared me to. Double thanks to you!
-*- I'd also like to thank Armagetz AGAIN for writing that hilarious "Arma-
    getz's Sweet Home" thing in your Harvest Moon FAQ. It inspired me to write
    my own.
-*- APool555 for all your fun Instant Messages!
-*- Sicarius for correcting the day of the week in the Anju / Kafei guide!
    Thank you so much! MWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!! *small explosions are heard*
-*- Rubzo for making me realize that this FAQ can be seen from anywhere in the
    world, even Scotland! Say hi to William Wallace for me :-P
-*- All the UKJokers, including UKJokerRubzo AGAIN! Thanks for being such great
    friends!!
-*- Argh! I just got an IM from the person who contributed and I still can't
    remember their name! Sorry!... If you're the one who pointed out the
    Mido-Tingle similarity, I'm sorry! Thank you!
-*- Anju for writing that Glitch FAQ. I hope I didn't violate any of your copy-
    right rules. I didn't copy any text, I just tried some of your glitches and
    added them to this FAQ in my own words.
-*- Snapdragon for coming up with the Three Day Challenge idea.
-*- Stop N Swop for being stupid.
-*- Perfect Light for your awesome artwork.
-*- FireDragonStarr for correcting the spelling of kleptomaniac. That was a
    typo. Honest.

-*- YOU for taking the time to read this FAQ!
-*- Anybody who e-mails me!
-*- All those wonderful people who have asked me questions. I LOVE getting
    questions about Majora's Mask, so e-mail me if you have ANY questions!

-*- I hope I don't insult anybody, but I'd also like to thank Jesus for many
    reasons (dying for me and forgiving my sins to name a few). Thank you so
    much for being born and inspiring Christmas (even though it's too commer-
    cial) so that I'm motivated to get this completed by Christmas for all you
    people who get it for Christmas. Thanks also for being so cool and loving
    me to death (literally).
-*- I'd also like to thank our really horrible public education system for pro-
    viding a very relaxing vacation (yeah right) so that I could spend it all
    writing this FAQ.

- WIDTH GUIDE -

If the above lines look strange, then try widening the window. This FAQ is
designed to be viewed using a fixed-width font like Courier and a width of 79
characters. Here's a test to see if the font you're using is fixed width:

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

If these rows are lined up perfectly, then the font you're using is fixed
width. If you're using a font such as Times New Roman, then the I line will be
much shorter than the W line. This FAQ was written using the Courier New font
size 10 pt. If you're viewing this in Times New Roman or some other non-fixed
width font, some of the maps, indents, tables, etc. will look wonky. If you're
viewing this in a word processor, try setting the font to a fixed width font
like Courier. Most of the graphics look best using Courier New. If you're view-
ing this on the web, it is most likely a fixed width font. If it seems wonky,
try seeing if your browser has a font option. If all else fails, load this into
Notepad or another word processor and set the font to Courier New (most com-
puters have this font, if you don't have it, try and find something else that
is fixed width). In Notepad, you can change the font by clicking on Options,
then Options again, then the ... elipsis next to the Screen font. Set it to
Courier New, 10 pt for best viewing.

In case you don't know, a fixed width font is a font in which all characters,
letters, numbers, symbols, etc. take up an equal amount of space. This means a
lower case i takes up the exact same space as a W. This is useful for making
maps and lining up tables.

One last thing. This FAQ uses some special symbols like § © ¶ and ﬁ. You may or
may not be able to view them, but you should. If you can't see these symbols or
if there's some other problem that may be related to them, please e-mail me.
If you want to see more symbols like this, open Character Map. If you're using
Windows (any version) it's usually found in the Accessories group. This is a
useful little program, try experimenting with it to find special characters.

Speaking of other characters....

You can ignore this if you aren't reading this on a Japanese-friendly computer.
I just felt like randomly sticking this in here. Also, if you happen to be
viewing this FAQ on a Japanese-friendly computer, many of my special symbols
(such as maps and dividers and such) will look like Kanji or Kana. Just ignore
it. If you want to see it properly, try viewing it on an English friendly
computer!
