====================WALKTHROUGH=====================
I.	Introduction
	Zelda Mujara's Mask is a great, but complicated
	game. The key to the game is remembering that
	when you play the Song of Time and you return
	back to the beginning of the three days all that you
	did will be erased including certain items.

	The save system has two options. Both of the save
	systems are not available until AFTER you retrieve
	the Orcania of Time from Skull Kid.

	The first is automatic; after you play the Song of
	Time your game is saved. The second one is a little
	different. If you played Dragon Warrior I&II Remix
	you may be familiar with it. There are Owl Statues
	all across this world that have two uses. The first is
	saving; you must hit it with your Sword, only your
	sword, to activate it. Talk to it and your game will be
	saved at that spot. The trick is you will be kicked out
	of the game. Once you start your game again you
	will start at the same exact spot, but if you hit reset
	then you return to the point you last played the Song
	of Time. The other use is when you hit it to activate
	the Owl Statue it becomes a Warp Point for later on
	when you get the Song of Soaring.

	The other thing to remember is that time is always
	flowing. The clock on your screen tells you what
	time and day it is. People and places are open at
	certain times. You may see the postman when you
	enter an area, but then see him in another area later
	that day.

II.	Story
	In the land of Hyrule, there echoes a legend. A
	legend held dearly by the Royal Family that tells of a
	boy. A boy who, after battling evil and saving
	Hyrule, crept away from that land that had made him
	a legend. When he finally fulfilled his heroic destiny
	and took his place among legends.

	Shortly after his victory he decided to go on a new
	journey. A personal and self fulfilling journey. Link
	rode his horse, Epona, in the woods when two fairies
	appearing out of nowhere startled Epona. A Strange
	Skull Kid came over took the Orcania of Time, the
	present from Princess Zelda. He then jumped on
	Epona and rode off into the Woods and Link gave a
	chase after him.
III.	Thief, Deku Shrub, and the Fairy
	a.	Lost Woods
		i.	After Epona and the Orcania get stolen,
			Skull Kid will run away.
		ii.	The first part is pretty simple, just follow
			Stalking into the tree and then you will
			fall down into the pit.
	b.	Lost Dungeon
		i.	When you land the Skull Kid will place a
			curse on you. He calls forth a spirit of a
			Deku Shrub and transforms you into
			Deku Shrub!
		ii.	Deku Shrub Mask
			1.	This mask has several properties;
				one won't be available until later.
			2.	You can dig into a Deku Flower
				spot and shoot up into the air; this
				will allow you to fly for a certain
				period of time.
			3.	You are vulnerable in this state
				and if you are hit you will fall to
				the ground
			4.	You are VERY weak to Fire and
				Water, Fire, or Lava, these
				elements will kill you, but water
				will transport you back to the spot
				you jumped from with a heart
				missing.
			5.	Later you can shoot a "Snot"
				bubble from your nose like an
				Arrow, the longer you hold it and
				bigger it gets, but it takes MP.
			6.	You are stuck with the mask until
				you complete the first part of this
				game.

			the hall, where you will be introduced to

			of the room, and this leads to a large
			canyon with several platforms.

			there use the flower to get to the platform
			to your left, where you will find a chest
			containing a Deku Nut.
		vi.	Turn around until you can see a platform
			behind the large pillar. Dive into the
			flower and fly around the pillar to land on
			the platform. Then use that flower to fly
			into the air, around the two pillars in
			front of you, and onto the rectangular
			platform. Take the Exit.
		vii.	You pass this odd twisting room run up
			the stairs to the left and you will come to
			a small room with a door.
	c.	Clock Tower; Inside
		i.	You will now meet the owner of the
			Happy Mask Shop. He will say that if
			you get the precious item back, he will be
			able to turn Link into his normal self
			again.
		ii.	He also tells you that Skull Kid stole a
			very precious and dangerous mask and he
			will be leaving the area in 3 days. You
			must find that mask before then.
	d.	South Clocktown
		i.	This town is the center of this land. You
			are currently in South Clock Town, but
			there is also an East, West, and North.
		ii.	When you see a "*" next to a title it
			means there is a Heart Piece, a "+" means
			there is Mask that can be found here, and

	     xxvii.	Then turn into Deku Link and dive into
			it, hop to each pillar until you get to the
			Heart Piece.
	    xxviii.	You now have to retrace your steps until
			you are back on the roof.
		xxix.	When you get there go to the middle part
			of the roof. You will need to walk on the
			edge of the roof and the fence.
		xxx.	Jump onto the platform right above the
			entrance and dive into the Deku Flower.
		xxxi.	Fly over to the switch and hit stand on it
			as Link to activate it. This will make light
			come into the next corridor that you are
			about to enter.
	     xxxii.	Go back into the entrance and go to the
			South Corridor this time. The door
			should be open if you hit both Eye
			Switches.
	    xxxiii.	Enter the room and if you hit the switch
			there should be some light there. Use this
			to kill the Floor Master. It will turn into 3
			smaller ones; you can use light or kill
			them with your shield.
	     xxxiv.	Reflect the light to the Sun Block to open
			up the rest of the passage. There will be 4
			more ReDeads here, past them or kill
			them and then go into the next room.
		xxxv.	You will find an old annoying friend, the
			Wizrobe. Take him out like before.
			1.	Stand in a corner and shoot at the
				one that is real.
	     xxxvi.	Once he is dead continue to the next
			room and up the stairs to the roof.
	    xxxvii.	On the roof go to the Skylight in the front
			of the roof. Place the Powder Keg on the
			glass and run away.
	   xxxviii.	When it explodes and then jumps down.
			You will be back in the middle near the
			entrance.
	     xxxix.	Now the light will allow you to clear the
			block in the middle of the room.
		xl.	Grab the pots in the room to re-stock on
			the Arrows.
		xli.	Go into the next room.
	h.	Ikana Castle; Throne Room
		i.	When you enter you see the Ikana
			Royalty in Stalkid form.
		ii.	He sends 2 of his warriors to kill you. For
			fun put on the Captain's Hat and go to
			the foot of the King. You will get a funny
			surprise.
		iii.	King's Guards
			1.	First thing you should do is take
				out the Fire Arrows and burn
				away the curtains. This will allow
				light into the room.
			2.	Attack the warriors with Arrows
				and your sword. Try to lure them
				to the light squares or around
				them.
			3.	When they fall down into a pile of
				bones and take your shield and
				then put the light onto their bones
				and they are dead for good.
		iv.	King
			1.	When both of the Warriors are
				dead then you have to fight the
				King. Follow the same rules, but
				he is a little harder.
		v.	Once they are dead then the King will
			recognize you are the warrior you are.
		vi.	In return he will teach you a new song
			Elegy of Emptiness.
		vii.	Elegy of Emptiness
			1.	> < > \/ > /\ <
			a.	This song will allow you
				to create a "Totem" of
				your form. You have 4
				forms so you can have up
				to 4 Totems.
				i.	They will hold
					down switches for
					you that would not
					stay down unless
					they are stood on.
		viii.	You may want to play the Song of Time
			now to save and make sure things get
			easier next time.
XVIII.	Free the Stone Tower
	a.	Stone Tower Entrance
		i.	The Stone Tower is in the corner of the
			canyon. Climb up and you will need to
			complete a few things to get to the top.
		ii.	You will be Hookshooting from different
			points and then using the Elegy of
			Emptiness to make the switches stay
			down.
		iii.	Jump over the platforms and look out for
			the falling boulders. They will be all over
			here so get use to them.
		iv.	Step onto the switch and play the Elegy
			of Emptiness to keep the switch down.
		v.	Now Hookshot to the next ledge where
			there is a Beamos standing guard.
		vi.	Knock him out with a Z Targeted Bomb
			and then step onto the switch.
		vii.	Turn into a Goron or Zora and step onto
			this switch and play the Elegy of
			Emptiness again.
		viii.	This will make the second platform go
			into place. Hookshot to the next target.
		ix.	This time step onto the switch with the
			only other form you haven't used.
		x.	This will complete the platform. Jump
			over them to get to the other side.
		xi.	The next switches are not important. You
			use these when you want to go back
			down.
		xii.	Now Hookshot to the next switch and
			leave a Totem on the switch, doesn't
			matter which one as long as it isn't Deku,
			they are too light.
		xiii.	Hookshot to the next platform and kill
			the Beamos again and flip the switch
			with a Totem.
		xiv.	Hookshot to the next one again and guess
			what you are going to do here! If you
			don't know please let me slap you.
		xv.	Leave a Totem to make the final bridge
			of platforms and jump across.
		xvi.	Now Hookshot up the next three ledges
			and activate the Final Owl Statue!
			1.	You can now warp to anywhere in
				this world!
		xvii.	Take out some of the pots and grass to
			heal up. You will need it for this temple.
			Make sure you have some Blue Potions.
			You will defiantly need them for the
			Boss fight.
	     xviii.	You can play the Song of Time now that
			the Owl Statue is activated and you have
			instant access to the temple.
			1.	Again make sure you are
				prepared. This is the longest most
				complicated temple, but it is the
				last one too.
		xix.	Now you have to activate the next three
			platforms to get to them to work you
			need to leave Totems on all three of
			them, but they need to done in the right
			order.
			1.	Middle, Right, & Left
		xx.	Jump over the platforms and enter the
			Stone Tower.
	b.	Stone Tower
		i.	First let me say that if you skipped all of
			the previous fairies then you should start
			now. Not only do the Fairy Chests make
			great Hookshot targets, but also the
			reward is beyond imagination.
		ii.	The next thing I have to explain is that
			you have to complete the temple in its
			two forms. First is the normal way and
			then flip.
		iii.	The up is down, and the down is up. It is
			actually cool when you get to that point.
			It will open new areas for you, change
			old ones, and just make the place look
			cool.
		iv.	This first room is open. The first thing
			you want to do is to shoot the left eye of
			the statue to make the first Fairy Chest
			appear.
			1.	Fairy 1
		v.	This chest will make a good Hookshot
			target later on. Now take the left door,
			but don't bother to kill the Dragon Flies
			around here. They will come back once
			you leave the room.
		vi.	This next room will require the use of
			Totems again. There is a bomb wall
			straight in front of you. Blow it up and
			knock down the large crates here.
		vii.	Now grab a small crate and leave it on
			the switch right near the entrance.
		viii.	Go north and leave a crate or totem on
			that switch. To the left near the wall there
			is a huge switch. Turn into a Goron and
			leave a Totem on that switch.
		ix.	Go to the right and leave another Totem
			on that switch to make the gate rise and
			lead to the next area.
		x.	There is a section with some grass on it,
			if you need some supplies cut them
			down.
		xi.	Now blow up the other section on the
			floor to make a skylight. You will notice
			it by the discolored tiles.
		xii.	Take the stairs to the lower floor. This
			room has a fairy near the entrance. Look
			for the Hookshot target to the right of the
			door. Up there is a Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 2
		xiii.	There is a Sun Block in the back of the
			room. Use your Mirror Shield to take
			care of it. You should have light from the
			opened skylight you blew up from above.
		xiv.	There are 6 Armos here. 4 have to be
			killed to get your first Small Key.
		xv.	The two behind the Sun Block and the
			two in the lava. Go across the lava as
			Goron Link and hit them with a punch.
		xvi.	Punch them one more time and run
			before they explode. When they are dead
			a chest will appear with the Small Key.
		xvii.	Go back upstairs and unlock the door
			near the grass opposite of the skylight.
	     xviii.	There is a Small Key chest on the
			opposite side of the water. Turn into a
			Zora and dive in. Avoid the mines in the
			water.
		xix.	You can do a dolphin dive out of the
			water and land on the opposite side or
			you can get caught by the Dexi-Hand to
			toss you up.
		xx.	Get the chest for the Small Key. Do not
			rush out just yet. Take a bomb and throw
			it over the fence to make the Crystal
			Switch flip and create a chest.
		xxi.	Dive backs in the water kill the Dexi-
			Hands and enter the underwater door.
		xxii.	There is an underwater switch here at the
			bottom of the floor surrounded by mines.
	     xxiii.	Throw your scales at the mines to blow
			them up and step on the switch to create a
			Fairy Chest that is upside down.
		xxiv.	Now go to the top onto the bridge and
			look for the Eye Switch in ice. Fire a Fire
			Arrow at it. That will create a chest that
			will be accusable when the temple is
			flipped.
		xxv.	There is also a beam of light coming
			from the top of the floor onto the bridge.
		xxvi.	Aim the light with your Mirror Shield to
			the mirror straight ahead of you. Keep it
			there. This will capture the light and re-
			shine it for you.
	     xxvii.	After about 10-15 seconds it is fully
			charged, run over and light up the Sun
			Block to make the path clear for the
			Compass.
			1.	This also makes a shortcut to the
				first room.
	    xxviii.	Now go to the other side and open the
			locked door with the Small Key.
		xxix.	This room has several fairies and the
			mirrors that you dealt with before.
		xxx.	First turn into a Goron and punch the
			pillar down to make the sunbeam appear.
		xxxi.	You will need to take some time to
			charge the mirrors and the black boes will
			do what ever they can to stop you.
			1.	Put on the Stone Mask to make
				sure they won't bother you.
	     xxxii.	Now use it to hit the last Sun Switch on
			the right side to make a Fairy Chest
			appear. It is behind the center pillar of
			mirrors.
			1.	Fairy 3
	    xxxiii.	There are 3 mirrors in the center of the
			room. You will need to charge a series of
			them, but first lets get rid of the Sun
			Block to get the second Fairy Chest.
	     xxxiv.	Aim the sunbeam to the right mirror and
			wait for it to charge and then run to it and
			aim that light to the Sun Block. Inside is
			the Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 4
		xxxv.	Go back to the sunbeam and aim it to the
			left mirror and then wait for it to charge.
	     xxxvi.	Now run to the mirror and aim it to the
			other mirror on the far left wall. Keep the
			beam there until it stops coming from
			that mirror and run to the next mirror.
	    xxxvii.	The beam will not last as long as it did
			before you aim it quickly to the Sun
			Block in the back of the room. Exit
			through the door to the next area.
			1.	If you mess up or fail then try
				again. It takes several times to get
				it right.
	   xxxviii.	This room is actually kind of fun. You
			will need to turn into Deku Link and take
			the Deku Flower into the air.
	     xxxix.	Turn to the left and enter the alcove to
			find a Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 5
		xl.	Drop to the bottom, but as a Goron,
			otherwise you will burn in the lava.
		xli.	Towards the entrance is a Goron Switch
			that needs to be pounded on. This will
			make a ring of fire disappear over the
			foot switch.
		xlii.	You need to Goron Roll around the
			corner dodging all of the obstacles before
			the fire starts up again and hit the switch
			to make a Fairy Chest appear on the
			platform above.
	     xliii.	Go back to the beginning and climb the
			ladder and take the Deku Flower. Here is
			where the fun begins.
		xliv.	Pop out and fly straight for the vent and it
			will give you a push higher into the air.
		xlv.	Go around the corner and take the next
			vent and fly around the next corner.
		xlvi.	This gets tricky; there is a Real
			Bombachu there that will attack you if
			you hit the sides.
	     xlvii.	If you hit him he will be gone making it
			easier for you to make it next time.
	    xlviii.	Keep flying to the next vent and onto the
			platform. Take the Fairy Chest now that
			you can reach it.
			1.	Fairy 6
		xlix.	Go through the door to the next area and
			the Sub Boss.
	c.	Stone Tower; Sub Boss
		i.	Garo Master
			1.	This Garo is a lot different that
				the ones before. He can quickly
				recover when you block with his
				shield.
			2.	The best way to get him is to do a
				back flip when he strikes. Then
				jump slash. He will teleport so be
				on guard.
			3.	As a reward you will get the Light
				Arrow.
		ii.	Light Arrow
			1.	This is more useful than in Oot.
				This time it is a lot more useful.
			2.	You can dissolve Sun Blocks and
				activate Sun Switches with not
				sunbeams.
		iii.	Take your new prize and head through
			the south door and continue through to
			the next one.
		iv.	This room has an Eyegore. He will ignore
			you at first, but head up to him and he
			will become active.
		v.	Shoot a Light Arrow in his eye to stun
			him and then hit him again with another
			Arrow or Hookshot.
		vi.	Repeat a few times and you will get a
			fairy.
			1.	Fairy 7
		vii.	Go back to the entrance via the Song of
			Soaring and head back to the room with
			the switches and go through the next
			room.
		viii.	This is the room with the water and the
			Sun Blocks and where you got the second
			Small Key.
		ix.	If you threw the bomb over the edge to
			hit the crystal switch on the opposite
			platform while you in the here before
			there should be a chest on this side of the
			room.
		x.	 If there is hit the Sun Switch with a
			Light Arrow to dissolve it and take the
			Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 8
		xi.	If you forgot to do it then swim across
			and then throw the bomb over and go
			around and get the chest.
		xii.	Go back to the entrance and stand in the
			middle platform that has the Sun Switch
			in front of it. Hit the Sun Switch with the
			Light Arrow to create an upside down
			Fairy Chest.
		xiii.	Now go back outside so you will be on
			the trio of the platforms that you created
			to enter.
		xiv.	This is the time to go and refill on Magic.
			You will need plenty of Magic here and
			mainly in the Boss Room, so fill up those
			Empty Bottles.
		xv.	Below the entrance is an odd looking
			symbol with a red orb in the center.
		xvi.	Hit it with a Light Arrow to make the
			temple flip upside down.
			1.	Garo Master; "Make the Heaven
				and the Moon switch places with
				the Earth."
			2.	The temple is flipped but the
				rooms are in the same order.
				Think of looking at a mirror
				facing the top of the temple. The
				left to the left and the right is still
				right.
	d.	Stone Tower; Inverted
		i.	Enter the temple. If you hit the Sun
			Switch while the temple was right side up
			you should see a chest in front of the
			Boss's Teleport platform. Open it to find
			a Fairy.
			1.	Fairy 9
		ii.	Your next destination is the right room.
			This room has 3 fairies and none of them
			are east to get.
		iii.	Turn into Deku Link and jump off the
			edge and land on the vent that will take
			you up. Fly straight across to the alcove
			with the fairy in a bubble.
			1.	Fairy 10
		iv.	Now jump off the edge and shoot a Light
			Arrow at the Sun Switch near the
			entrance. This will make a Fairy Chest
			appear, but upside down. We will get to
			this one later.
		v.	Turn into Deku Link and jump on the
			vents and fly to the east side and then
			step onto the silver footswitch and leave
			a Totem as Link.
		vi.	Now jump onto the other vent and fly to
			the farthest one that goes to the ceiling.
		vii.	Ride it up and go to the wall above the
			entrance and get the Fairy Chest that was
			previously surrounded by fire.
			1.	Fairy 11
		viii.	Now go to the entrance to the next room.
			It is at the top of the room in the west
			corner surrounded by mines.
		ix.	This room is a little complicated. There
			are 2 of the emblems you saw at the
			entrance to the temple.
		x.	If you shoot these emblems then the
			room and the room only will rotate like
			the temple did.
		xi.	This first room all you need to do is shoot
			the emblem and roll over the lava as a
			Goron.
		xii.	This room is a little harder. This is a little
			tricky. You need to pull the block in the
			room to the edge of the elevated floor and
			then shoot the emblem to make the room
			reverse allowing you to move it again.
		xiii.	You need to repeat this until you get to
			the hole in the opposite corner of the
			room to make the door open.
	e.	Stone Tower; Sub Boss II
		i.	Wizrobe IV
			1.	This time is the final time you
				have to fight him in a temple, but
				not the last time you have to fight
				him.
			2.	Find a corner and stay there and
				shoot him with some Light
				Arrows until he is dead, only 4-5
				shots!
		ii.	Now Hookshot up to the Fairy Chest that
			appeared. Open it and take the final fairy
			that you can get right now.
			1.	Fairy 12
		iii.	Now take the stairs. There is a huge pit in
			front of you, turn into a Deku and dive in
			and fly over to the other side.
		iv.	Now dive into that flower and fly into the
			alcove on your left facing the pit.
		v.	Put on your Stone Mask and those little
			stomping guys will leave you alone.
		vi.	Look for the footswitch in the back of the
			alcove and leave a Totem and then get
			the chest that contains the Small Key.
		vii.	Return back to the exit and rolling jump
			over to the platform and open the door.
		viii.	This is where it gets hard this area.
			Before you start to fly shoot the mines
			with an Arrow to knock them into each
			other to make them blow up.
		ix.	Dive into the flower and take it to the
			mines you just blew up and then dive into
			that flower and fly to the other side again.
			Go through the bridge and into the next
			room to the final sub boss.
	f.	Stone Tower; Sub Boss III
		i.	Gomess
			1.	This one is a little harder than the
				previous ones. He is undead and
				the Light Arrow is their worst
				enemy.
			2.	He is cloaked in bats, but when
				you shoot him with the Light
				Arrow they will scatter.
			3.	Now run up and jump slash or
				slash at him as much and as fast
				as you can. When he strikes use
				your shield or jump back.
		ii.	After he is dead collect the Boss Key
			from the cage and exit the room.
		iii.	Go across the bridge and then shoot the
			mines clearing that Deku Flower and fly
			to it, and fly back to the entrance that you
			came in from before.
		iv.	Do not go through the door, but there is a
			small path on the side that leads to a
			door.
		v.	There is a Death Armos here that can get
			in the way, if you can put on the Stone
			Mask and jump across, but sometimes he
			blocks you path. You need to shoot him
			with a Light Arrow and attack him after
			to kill him.
		vi.	Step on the switch to make a Fairy Chest
			appear upside down and Hookshot over
			to it.
		vii.	There is an Eyegore here that is like the
			previous one. Shoot him with a Light
			Arrow and then repeat it, he won't fall
			this time around.
		viii.	After you beat him you will get a chest
			with a very useful, now anyway, but
			wasteful mask.
		ix.	Giant' Mask
			1.	This mask will allow you to grow
				20X your normal size, but ONLY
				in Twinmold's Lair.
		x.	Go into the door collecting any pots or
			boxes along the way. This room seems a
			little bit more difficult, but it pretty easy.
		xi.	Shoot the Crystal Switch to make the
			upside down and Hookshot over to it.
		xii.	Then Hookshot to the target on the
			ceiling and collect any hearts below you.
		xiii.	Open the door to the Boss Chamber and
			stock on any items in the room before
			you fall down the hole.
	g.	Stone Temple; Boss
		i.	Twinmold
			1.	They are pretty simple to kill, but
				the hard part is the size.
			2.	Put on the Giant's Mask to make
				you grow. You will be 20X your
				size and an even match for
				Twinmold, but your Magic Bar
				will decrease as you stay in this
				form.
			3.	You can only hurt the two
				monsters if you hit them on their
				heads and tails. They will come
				out of the ground around your
				location.
			4.	If you need Magic lure them to
				the stone blocks and return to
				normal size to pick up the items.
			5.	If you still run out of Magic you
				can stay small and kill them.
			6.	Stand in the center and shoot
				arrows at their heads and tails
				only when they are close.
		ii.	When they are dead you will get the
			Twinmold's Sacred Mask, but there is
			more to do so don't play the Song of
			Time.
		iii.	You need to collect 3 more fairies.
		iv.	Play the Song of Soaring and then go to
			the Stone Towers Temple.
		v.	Make sure it is right side up now so that
			you can get the fairies.
		vi.	The first one is in the first room inside
			the Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 13
		vii.	Go to the left door and then place the
			Totems and the boxes on the switches so
			the door will open.
		viii.	Take the right door and then dive into the
			water to get the Fairy Chest as a Zora.
			1.	Fairy 14
		ix.	Now go through the underwater tunnel on
			the right side into the next room and go
			onto the bridge.
		x.	Go north to the next room with the tons
			of mirrors. Go north through that room to
			the room with the Lava and Vents.
		xi.	Go across as Deku Link like before and
			go into the next room, and again through
			that room.
		xii.	This is the room with the one long rafter
			in the middle of the room and here is the
			final Fairy Chest.
			1.	Fairy 15; Final Fairy.
		xiii.	Play the Song of Soaring and then the
			Song of Soaring again to take you back to
			Ikana Canyon.
	h.	Ikana Canyon; Fairy Fountain "="
		i.	The Fountain is just below the entrance
			to the Stone Tower, the one IN the
			Canyon.
		ii.	Inside return the Stray Fairies and get the
			most precious sword of the game.
		iii.	Great Fairy's Sword
			1.	This Sword is actually an item.
				You need to assign it to "C" and
				then use that "C" button to attack.
			2.	It will stay out so you can jump
				slash with it, but blocking only
				makes you crouch down.
			3.	It is the most powerful item of the
				game and worth all of the work.
			4.	No more Fairy Fountains!
XIX.	Extra Stuff
	a.	Ikana Canyon VI
		i.	Play the Song of Time if time is low and
			return to the canyon.
		ii.	Dive into the water below and head to the
			left into the cavern above the water.
	b.	Ikana Canyon; Secret Shrine "*"
		i.	Inside is another Garo that is offering to
			give you a small test of skill. You need
			the Light Arrow to participate in the
			games.
		ii.	You need to shoot a Light Arrow above
			the door to open it and you need at last 16
			Heart Containers before you can play, but
			it is free to do it!
		iii.	Room I; Garo Master
			1.	There is a Garo Master like in the
				Stone Tower.
			2.	Wait for him to attack, jump back,
				and strike like before.
		iv.	Room II; Wort
			1.	Like before Hookshot his looser
				parts and swipe at them with your
				new sword.
			2.	When you clear enough to open a
				spot for the eye then shoot him in
				the eye and attack.
		v.	Room III; Wizrobe
			1.	This is the last time you have to
				fight him, really, unless you need
				to do a temple again.
			2.	Stand in a corner and take him out
				with your new Light Arrows.
		vi.	Room IV; Lizalfos
			1.	They are SO simple with your
				Fairy Sword so take them down in
				a few swipes of your sword.
		vii.	You not only get a Heart Piece for
			beating all 4 rooms you get 100 Rupees
			for clearing each room!
			1.	This is a good moneymaker.
XX.	Face the Skull Kid
	a.	Clocktown
		i.	The Skull Kid is actually the Imp that

			discard of Skull Kid and challenge Link
			to come to the Moon and face him, before
			the Giant's lose their grip and drop the
			Moon. Follow Mujara's Mask into the
			portal to the Moon.
XXI.	The Finale; Mujara's Mask
	a.	Moon
		i.	The Moon is a lot different that you
			think. It is a peaceful plain with 5
			different kids with 5 different masks on.
		ii.	Talk to each of them and they will want
			to play a game, but they want some
			masks first.
		iii.	We will go in order of the temples for the
			people, but consider what you are giving
			up when they want the masks.
			1.	Discard useless ones first like the
				Postman's Hat, Giant's Mask, etc.
			2.	Keep the Mask of Truth till last
				for a Joke!
		iv.	You will give some when you enter and
			exit the section of the moon until you are
			left with only 4 Masks.
		v.	What you are short 1 Heart Container!

			Piece you must redo the scenes to get to
			the Moon if you exit.

			1.	2
		ii.	This dungeon you will be using the Deku
			Mask to get through.

			the rotating flower to come to you and
			then pop out and land on the flower.
		iv.	Wait until you get to the other side and
			jump off and land on the platform to the
			right.
		v.	Take this flower to the next rotating
			flower, but wait for the "Bash" flower,
			this will send you higher and farther than
			the other.
		vi.	Go to the far right hand corner of the
			room and get Heart Piece.
		vii.	You can try to get back to the rotating
			flower, but you may just have to start
			over.
		viii.	The exit is to the left and talk to the
			Odolwa Child to exit the area.
	c.	Moon; Goht Child
		i.	Total Masks Wanted
			1.	4
		ii.	This one is actually kind of fun to do, but
			can get complicated. Try to stay along
			with me.
		iii.	Turn into a Goron and take the Magic
			Pots so that you are full. There are more
			in the paths if you need it.

			in a new direction, just hold the Roll

			shaped platform, unless you want to go
			back to the beginning.
		viii.	Go over the next bridge and go to the
			back of this ramp and start to roll again,
			but this time you need to sort of turn
			around the corner and then over the
			bridge then STOP.
		ix.	Walk the rest of the way to get some
			Green Magic Pots if you need them and
			start to roll again once you get to the
			bridge on the other side.
		x.	Start again and don't stop while you hit
			the Empty Chest and go over the final
			ramp to the Heart Piece.
		xi.	Now go south and then start to roll and
			STOP! Go over the bridge and start to
			roll right behind the warp spot and go
			over to the gap to the exit.
	d.	Moon; Gyorg Child
		i.	Total Masks Wanted
			1.	6
		ii.	This one is pretty simple, but hard. You
			need to turn into Zora Link and then go
			into the water.
		iii.	There are tubes here that have connection
			to each other and there is one with the
			Heart Piece and one with the exit.
		iv.	It is VERY easy to try to go one place
			and end up in another, so make sure you
			get the Heart Piece first!
		v.	To get the Heart Piece take the right
			tunnel and then take the first left then the
			next left and then the next left.
			1.	Easy right, wait and see!
		vi.	To get to the exit you need to take the left
			tunnel and then take the second right.
	e.	Moon; Twinmold Child
		i.	Total Masks Wanted
			1.	8
				a.	No more Masks Left!
		ii.	This is the first one where you have to
			actually battle monsters so warm up that
			Fairy Sword.
			1.	The other thing is if you see a
				Gossip Stone they will tell you
				where some masks are, but the
				only thing is some of them you
				already had to have to get here!
			2.	The other thing is one tells you
				where to find the Mask of Truth,
				ok if you say so buddy!
		iii.	The first three rooms are simple they
			contain a Lizalfos, then a Garo Master,
			and an Iron Knuckle.
		iv.	After you get to the final room Hookshot
			to the chest and open it and enter the
			door.
		v.	When you fight the Iron Knuckle you
			will not be able to get to the ledge!
		vi.	There should be a small crack in the wall
			on the right side. Open the chest and get
			some Bombchus and aim them for the
			crack in the wall.
		vii.	If your aim is right you will crack it open
			and hit the switch for the ladder to
			appear.
		viii.	This next one is a lot hard. The crack is
			on the ceiling this time, so take aim and
			hope for the best.
		ix.	If you air directly for it, the Bombchu
			will over shoot it's target. So stand in
			once corner and aim for the other.
			1.	This may not work so try different
				angles.
		x.	When you get it go into the next room
			and then the next for the final Heart Piece
			of the game and the exit.
	f.	Moon II
		i.	Go back to the Moon and all of the
			Sacred Children are gone, but one
			standing by the tree.
		ii.	Talk to him and he will tell you he wants
			masks too, but you have no more, but he
			will give you one as a token of
			friendship!
		iii.	Fierce Deity's Mask
			1.	This Masks is the most powerful
				Transformation Mask in the
				game.
			2.	When you beat the game you
				keep this mask with you as well
				as get all of the other masks back.
			3.	There is only one problem. It only
				works in Boss Rooms and there is
				only 1 other Boss Room besides
				the final one that it is of use.
				a.	Odolwa!
			4.	If you want to beat the game
				fairly then don't use this mask,
				stay regular Link.
		iv.	You will now be transported to the Final
			Boss' Room, Mujara!
	g.	Mujara's Lair
		i.	Again if you want to challenge the game
			then don't use your new Fierce Deity's
			Mask.
		ii.	Mujara's Mask; Form I
			1.	There are a total of 4 forms of the
				mask, each one harder than the
				last.
			2.	He is simple to hurt, shoot arrows
				at it or swipe it with your sword if
				you can reach.
			3.	After a few hits is will transform
				into a more deadly form.
		iii.	Mujara's Mask; Form II
			1.	This time the other Sacred Masks
				will come off of the wall and start
				trouble.
			2.	You can take them out with a few
				arrow shots for good or a swipe
				with your sword.
			3.	It may be a good idea to get rid of
				them ASAP.
			4.	Mujara also starts to breath fire at
				you that can become a pain in the
				royal duff.
			5.	You can use your Mirror Shield
				as regular Link to avoid this.
			6.	Attack with your sword and
				arrows again.
		iv.	Mujara's Mask; Form III
			1.	This time it grows arms and legs
				and is very fast.
			2.	You can use Arrows to take him
				down fast or go over to him and
				hit him with the Deity's Sword if
				you can catch him.
			3.	If you want to the Deku form can
				be helpful. His spins can dodge
				his attacks and take him down
				when he is on the ground.
		v.	Mujara's Mask; Form IV
			1.	This is the final and most deadly
				form. His arms are like Whips
				and can take you out at distances,
				so shooting Arrows is pretty hard,
				but necessary if you are Link.
			2.	Z Target is your best friend.
				Shoot Arrows while it is on or
				Jump Slash with your sword if
				you see an opening.
			3.	When it is down go after it with
				your strongest sword and start off
				with a Jump Slash and followed
				up with a series of swipes.
		vi.	If you are successful the evil will exit
			Mujara's Mask allowing you to take it
			peacefully.
