Why I decided to create this quick guide:

• Unlike my other FAQs, this is compacted and travel-size for printing and 
  organizing purposes! So considerate of me...
• The FAQ has been abbreviated to save loading time and easy navigation.
• It's a short, quick step-by-step guide to completing the whole game with no
  worries of ruining your gaming experience.
• I've always wanted do a guide for Zelda:MM. And here it is. Well, it wasn't
  supposed to be like this initially.


Things you should know:

• The lack of detail was intentional. 
• The guide exists as it is and no changes will be made to it no matter how
  much hate mail I get.
• As you probably already know, the game runs on an in-game three day cycle.
  I will not tell you when to reset the time; that's up to you. The guide 
  will flow along normally. So search for where you've left off and pick it
  up from there.
• This walkthrough will not incorporate locations of Heart Pieces, Stray
  Fairies, Masks or any other story-related elements, except the walkthrough 
  and maybe some songs.
• I only want to help your through the game, not beat the game for you. You
  must do, figure out and molest everything on your own, but consult this 
  guide if you're totally stumped.


Things you won't find in this FAQ:

• Just about everything except a bare-boned walkthrough.

  mainstream of the game.

  water and enter Zora Hall.

- The most information that can be wringed is from Evan, the band manager,
  and Lulu's diary sitting in her trashed room.

- After garnering and piecing information together, head back to North Great
  Bay, swim to the far eastern end to find a secret entrance to the Gerudo's 
  Fortress.

- NOTE: If you want to cross the line between cheating and playing fair, put
  on the Stone Mask for insane ease in this dungeon.

  patrolling on the surface, swim to the ramp on the opposite side.

- NOTE: You can knock guards unconscious temporarily by shishkabobing their
  heads.

  duct, this proves to be much easier than infiltrating the compound out in
  the open.

  expel you back to the entrance.

- From here, it's all pretty self-explanatory, the four eggs are isolated 
  from one another and they're kept in buildings located in all 4 directions,
  they're guarded by fiercely trained Gerudo warriors.

- After collecting all the eggs from the Gerudo Fortress, drop them off at 
  the lab, then head off to assemble the remaining 3.

- NOTE: Did you snap a picture of a female guard? If not, go back and do so.
  You'll need it to trade it in to free the seahorse that plays a role of 
  helping you get the last 3 eggs.

- Lure the Sea Snakes out of their homes and murder them, jerk.

- NOTE: There are a total of 8 Sea Snakes, and among them, only 3 contain the
  last of the Zora Eggs. 

- After the event, not only will you get the Zora Eggs, the seahorse bestows
  you a Piece of Heart as a gratuity.

  otherside of the entrance.

  before taking a swim, the Small Key is in the chest underwater.

- Climb back up the platform and ride the current to a different room, walk

- Inside, you'll find Wort, a bubbly, bouncing eyeball who is annoyingly 
  difficult to beat, you get the Ice Arrows for beating him.

- Freeze the Octoroks back in the red room, use them as stepping stones to  
  the red turnkey, turn it.

- In the room where you got your Dungeon Map, create icebergs in the water by
  directing an ice arrow into the water, hop across them to the door.

- Turn the Chu Chu into a sliding block, use it to climb onto the turnkey and
  push the switch.

- Create more icebergs leading to the stalagmites in the northeast in the 
  room where you had gotten the Compass.

  variation of Gekko with some hazardous jelly a Boss Key is the reward.

- Back at the room with the water sprout, hookshot your way to the final red
  switch and crank it.

  horizontal position for Link to walk across.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- NOTE: Stone Tower has, in fact, been turned upside down, but it really is a
  mirror image of what Stone Tower used to be before it was inverted. This 
  form of the temple is delusional and can make you confused, but know this:
  All the rooms are in the same position as they were before, except that the
  ground floor is now actually the ceiling. Shwa?

  air vent to an unlocked door.

- Hit the red switches with a Light Arrow, slap on that pseudo-Goron form and
  wade across the lava to reach the other red switch.

- Shoot the switch again, push the block towards the center notch, then shoot
  the switch yet again and fool around with the rotating room until the block
  meets the notch that unlocks the door.

- Fight Wizrobe, rematch no.4, he just never gives up, and he's even trickier
  than ever.

- From the platform, hookshot the Treasure Chest to pull Link up, at the top,
  Gomess awaits you, as well as the Boss Key. 

- Kill the Death Armos before jumping over to the final switch, hookshot it 
  to reach a locked door.

- Tangle with Eyegore for the Giant's Mask.

- Hookshot the chest on the ceiling and prepare to face an exceptionally hard
  boss.

- NOTE: You should fill your stock on Magic and Arrows.

- Use the Boss Key to battle the Giant Masked Insect, TwinMold, remember to 
  use the Giant's Mask to be able to fight it effectively.

- NOTE: If you have in your possession all the Stray Fairies, you can find 
  the Great Fairy by the dungeon entrance, she bequeaths you with the Great
  Fairy Sword. Go figure.

- NOTE: If you want to be absolutely invincable and make the last boss easy
  for you, you'll want to bring 20 normals masks.

- Speak to the Oldolwa mask-wearing kid to play his sick game, and do this to
  all the other kids wearing boss masks in the order you defeated them, each
  time giving up a certain number of masks.

- When you've finished all their "dungeons", you'll receive the ridiculously
  powerful Fierce Deity's Mask, which turns Link to a semi-adult wielding a
  huge sword that shoot projectiles.

- If you have that mask, the only strategy is to keep shooting projectiles at
  Majora's Mask. If not, then...

- Good luck, Majora's Mask is hard, you'll need some Chateau Milk, plenty of
  magic, arrows and nimble skills.

- His four forms are:
 
   *A regular floating mask waiting for you to kick its ass.
   *All the other boss masks accompany him in the fight.
   *Majora has legs and he's quick.
   *A full grown humanoid thing with loooong whips.
  
  I pray for thee, and bonne chance!
