========================================
Outside the Temple of Time
========================================
1
From left to right:
"They say that Malon set the original record in the obstacle course of Lon 
Lon Ranch."

2
"They say that Malon of Lon Lon Ranch hopes that a knight in shining armor 
will come and sweep her off her feet someday."

3
"They say that it is against the rules to use glasses at the Treasure Chest 
Game in Hyrule Castle Town Market."
[Use the lens of truth and you can see through the treasure chests.]

4
"They say that Gerudos sometimes come to Hyrule Castle Town Market to look 
for boyfriends."
[Not a clue never seen Gerudos anywhere outside of their fortress and the 
Spirit Temple.]


========================================
Outside Hyrule Castle
========================================
5
On the platform just past the climbable vine wall:
"They say that if you get close to a butterfly while holding a Deku Stick 
in your hands, something good will happen."
[If you let a butterfly land on a deku stick it will turn into a fairy.]

6
In the corner past the climbable stone wall:
"They say that, contrary to her elegant image, Princess Zelda of Hyrule 
Castle is actually a tomboy!"

7
In the hole next to the tree inside the castle fence (requires song of 
storms):
"They say that you may find something new in dungeons you have already 
finished."
[Go back into the deku tree with bombs and dodongo's cavern as an adult 
with the scarecrow song to get the gold skulitas.]


========================================
Desert Colossus
========================================
8
To the left of the entrance to the spirit temple:
"They say that the treasure you can earn in the Gerudos Training Ground is 
not as great as you'd expect, given its difficulty!"
[Hey the arrows kill likelikes in one hit and the only thing like shooting 
a Wolfos in the back with a frozen arrow is using a flaming one.]


========================================
Kakoriko Village
========================================
9
Outside Shadow Temple warp point, in the Graveyard:
"They say that there is a secret near a tree in Kakariko Village."
[Bomb near the tree to expose a hole with 2 redeads inside after defeating 
them you get 200 rupees.]


========================================
Death Mountain Path
========================================
10
On a ledge on the cliff wall leading up Death Mountain:
"They say that Biggoron's Sword is super-sharp and will never break."


========================================
Death Mountain Crater
========================================
11
From the death mountain entrance run to the right where you'll see a board 
leading up to another platform, in the corner is a bombable wall with the 
stone behind it:
"They say that Medigoron didn't really think about his own size so his 
store is really cramped."
[It is cramped...he's a huge (m/g)oron and it's small.]


========================================
Goron City
========================================
12
Inside the stone maze on the top floor:
"They say that there is a secret around the entrance to Gerudo Valley."
[Referring to a hole exposable by bombing in the middle of a circle of 
rocks mentioned a little further down.]

13
Next to Medigoron in side his Blacksmith shop:
"They say that Ganondorf is not satisfied with ruling only the Gerudo and 
aims to conquer all of Hyrule!"
[Imagine that.]


========================================
Lost Woods
========================================
14
Next to the deku scrub who sells the stick upgrade below the bridge you 
cross leading to kokori village:
"They say that when non-fairy folk enter the Lost Woods they become 
monsters."
[Note that every group of skull kids has a piece of heart you can get from 
them...so maybe foreigners in the forest isn't a bad thing...]


========================================
Sacred Forest Meadow
========================================
5
In the corner near the Minuete of Forest warp point:
"They say that it's possible to find a total of 100 Gold Skulltulas 
throughout Hyrule."

6
On top of the maze walls, stone nearest the middle:
"They say that the strange owl, Kaepora Gaebora, may look big and heavy, 
but its character is rather lighthearted."

7
On top of the maze walls, stone nearest the entrance
"They say that the owl named Kaepora Gaebora is the reincarnation of an 
Ancient Sage."


========================================
Kokiri Forest
========================================
8
Next to the entrance to the Lost Woods
"They say that the small holes in the ground that you can find all over 
Hyrule make perfect breathing ground for bugs."
[All the stones in these holes always say the same thing.]

9
To the left of the Great Deku Tree
"They say that the Kokiri are always followed by small fairies."

0
Behind and to the right of the Great Deku Tree (note: the gameshark is NOT 
required to talk to this stone):
"They say that one Kokiri has left the forest, and he is still alive!"
[This is talking about Link for the same reason Ruto called Shiek a 'he' so 
they didn't spoil the rest of the game.]


========================================
Zora's River
========================================
1
In the shallow water by the waterfall which hides Zora's domain entrance
"They say that Princess Zelda's nanny is actually one of the Shekiah, who 
many thought had died out."

2
Out on the lone platform used to access the near by piece of heart:
"They say that there is a man who can always be found running around Hyrule 
Field."
[I wouldn't really call that running, if he doesn't have the bunny hood 
since you can walk backwards faster.]


========================================
Zora's Domain
========================================
3
In the shallow water between King Zora and the platform you stand on to 
talk to it:
"They say that players who select HOLD option for Z-Targeting are the real 
Zelda players!"
[I always found this easier than the default setting.]


========================================
Lord Jabu Jabu's Shrine
========================================
4
In the shallows to the left of Lord Jabujabu against the wall:
"They say that there is a secret near the lone tree which is not far from 
the river in the North-West part of Hyrule field."
[Bomb the tree between the river and Lon Lon ranch and there's a piece of 
heart under water the requires either the iron boots or gold scale to get 
to.]

5
Next to the entrance to great Fairy Fountain
"They say that you can swim faster by continually pressing B."
[At least it makes the trip back easier.]


========================================
Gerudo Valley
========================================
6
To the left of the waterfall
"They say that the thief named Nabooru, who haunts this area, is a Gerudo."


========================================
Lake Hylia
========================================
7
To the left of the entrance from Hyrule Field across the thin land bridge
"They say that that there's a secret on the road to Lake Hylia."
[Bomb in the middle of the square fenced in area to find a hole with a 
business scrub who sells a piece of heart for 10 rupees.]

8
In the shallows of the lake at the top right corner of the map, diagonal 
from the island with the grave with the owl on it:
"They say that Ruto, the Zora Princess who is known for her selfish nature, 
likes a certain boy..."

9
In the shallows of the lake at the top left corner of the map, diagonal 
from the island where the fire arrows land:
"They say that the chicken lady goes to the lake side laboratory to study 
how to make pocket sized cuccos."


========================================
Dodongo's Cavern
========================================
0
On the left side wall in the main room
"They say that Gerudos worship Ganondorf like a god."


========================================
Hyrule Field
========================================
1
Inside a hole by Gerudo Valley accessible by bombing in the middle of the 
circle of rocks:
"They say that there is a switch you can only activate by using the spin 
attack."
[I was thinking this was the switch in the spirit barrier that you use
bombchus on but the spin won't reach it.  In the water temple there's a 
switch on the other side of a gate but it can be hit with a jump 
attack...any clues?]

In every small hole with a gossip stone, treasure chest, fish, plants with 
bugs under them, and bee hives in the corners the gossip stones all say the 
same thing:
"They say that the horse Ganondorf rides is a solid black Gerudo stallion."
[He's got a black horse...so what.  Maybe they ran out of mysterious things 
to say?]
