I.  Introduction 
----------------

Welcome to my newest FAQ!  I've recieved immense feedback on my other FAQs (99% 
of it positive), and, since people seem to love my FAQs, I'll keep writing more 
of them!  I've recently been reliving my Final Fantasy VII days, and I love the 
game even more than before.  (Still not as much as Xenogears, though.)  It 
inspired me to write a FAQ on the lesser aspects of the game, such as where to 
get all of the Ultimate Weapons and the Level 4 Limit Breaks.  Few people have 
done EVERYTHING there is to do in this game, and this FAQ is here to help those 
people.  Hope you enjoy my newest FAQ!  As always, if you have any questions 
about any RPG, or want to submit something, you can write me at 
[LightRanma@aol.com].  Now, on with the FAQ!

Round.

Typoon (Disintegration)
Location: Ancient Forest

IV. Limit Break List
--------------------

Here, I'll give you a description of every Limit Break in the game.  First off, 
a little fact that most people DON'T know: Limit Breaks are not learned at 
random.  The first Limit Break in a set is learned by killing 80 enemies (the 
person who gets the killing blow gets the kill).  The oly exception is Vincent, 
who must only kill 60 enemies.  The second Limit Break in a set is learned after 
the first one is used eight times.  The easiest way, I think, to kill as many 
enemies as possible in the shortest amount of time is to use a weak Summon Spell 
(such as Ifrit or Ramuh) against large groups of weak enemies (groups as big as 
four or five enemies can be found in the Corel Mountains).  Anyway, however you 
decide to do it, good luck.

- Cloud Strife -

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Braver: Cloud leaps high into the air, and brings his sword down upon one enemy 
for light damage.

Cross-Slash: Cloud cuts the kanji "Kyou" into a single enemy, doing slightly 
more damage than Braver and paralyzing the enemy.  Doesn't paralyze some Bosses.

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Blade Beam: Cloud fires a beam from his sword at one enemy for moderate damage.  
The beam then splits apart and hits all other enemies for 1/4 the damage.

Climhazzard: Cloud drives his sword into an enemy, and then leaps high into the 
air, doing heavy damage.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Meteorain: Cloud leaps into the air and fires six meteors at random enemies, 
with each one doing light to moderate damage.

Finishing Touch: Cloud forms a tornado that instantly destroys most regular 
enemies, and does serious damage to those that live.  It does moderate damage to 
Bosses, but you're probably better off with Meteorain when fighting Bosses.

Level 4 Limit Break

Omnislash: Cloud launches a flashy, fierce, 15-hit combo against all enemies, 
hitting them at random for moderate to heavy damage each.

- Tifa Lockheart -

Tifa's Limit Breaks are a bit different from everyone else's - each new Limit 
Break is added to a combo, and each hit depends on what the Slots land on.  If 
you land on a "Hit", that Limit Break will hit.  If it lands on a "Miss", that 
Limit Break will be skipped.  If it lands on a "Yeah!", that Limit Break will 
hit AND do extra damage.  The slots become increasingly hard with each new Limit 
Break.

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Beat Rush: Tifa launches a small combo against an enemy, for light damage.

Somersault: Tifa somersault kicks an enemy for light damage.

Level 2 Limit Breaks 

Waterkick: Tifa sweep kicks an enemy for moderate damage.

Meteodrive: Tifa performs a suplex on an enemy for moderate damage.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Dolphin Blow: Tifa summons a dolphin (?) and performs an uppercut against an 
enemy, for moderate to heavy damage.

Meteor Strike: Tifa shows off her strength and leaps high into the air with the 
enemy, and slams it down, head first, into the ground, for heavy damage.

Level 4 Limit Break

Final Heaven: Tifa focuses her ki into her index finger and hits one enemy with 
a huge blast of energy, for incredibly massive damage.  Don't even try for a 
"Yeah!" on this one.. it's vitually impossible.  A 7-hit combo with a few 
"Yeah!"s is powerful enough.

- Barret Wallace - 

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Big Shot: Barret focuses energy into his gun-arm and hits one enemy with a big 
blast of energy, for light to moderate damage.

Mindblow: Barret focuses a different, blue energy into his gun-arm and hits an 
enemy with it, draining its MP.  Great against Bosses with powerful Magic 
attacks.

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Grenade Bomb: Barret fires a grenade into the enemy group, doing moderate damage 
to all enemies.

Hammerblow: Using all of his strength, Barret drives into one enemy, completely 
eliminating it from the battle.  Useless against some enemies and all Bosses.  
It doesn't do any direct damage.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Satellite Beam: Barret summons lasers from space that hit all enemies for 
moderate to heavy damage each.

Ungarmax: Barret fires 18 rounds at the enemy group, with each hit doing light  
damage.

Level 4 Limit Break

Catastrophe: Using his gun-arm, Barret launches himself into the air and fires a 
massive beam of super-heated plasma energy at all enemies, hitting them 20 times 
at random for moderate damage each.

- Aeris Gainsborough -

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Healing Wind: Aeris summons a gentle breeze that recovers half of each 
character's Max HP (i.e a character with 400 max HP would recover 200 HP).

Seal Evil: Aeris casts a curse on all enemies, which Stops and Silences them, 
effectively sealing their spell-casting abilities.

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Breath of the Earth: Aeris summons a healing energy and nullifies all negative 
and positive Status Ailments.

Fury Brand: Sacrificing her own Limit Break, Aeris fills the Limit Guages of her 
other party members with a strong energy.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Planet Protector: Aeris summons golden energy which surrounds the members, 
making them invulnerable for a limited time.

Pulse of Life: Aeris brings forth a healing light that refills everyone's HP and 
MP, removes all Status Ailments, AND completely restores any dead party members.

Level 4 Limit Break

Great Gospel: A heavenly beam of light engulfs all the party members, restoring 
all their HP and MP, AND making them invincible for a limited time.

- Red XIII -

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Sled Fang: Red XIII charges through an enemy with great force, causing moderate 
damage.

Lunatic High: Red XIII emits a yellow beam which casts Haste on everyone, and 
increases their Evade % by 50%.

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Blood Fang: Red XIII charges through an enemy and refills his HP and MP to that 
of the enemy's current MP level.

Stardust Ray: Ten energy stars fall from the sky and strike random enemies, with 
each hit doing light damage.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Howling Moon: Red XIII leaps in front of the full moon, and casts Haste and 
Berserk on himself, as well as raises his Attack Power significantly.  This 
Limit Break has its obvious advantages and disadvantages.

Earth Rave: Red XIII launches a five-hit Elemental combo that hits each time for 
moderate damage.

Level 4 Limit Break

Cosmo Memory: Red XIII absorbs star energy, and after charging up, fires a 
massive atomic beam of red energy at all enemies, doing incredibly massive 
damage to each (usually 9999 in the higher levels).

- Cait Sith -

Cait Sith has only two Limit Breaks, although his second Limit Break is divided 
up into eight different attacks.

Level 1 Limit Break

Dice: Cait Sith throws two to six dice at the enemy.  The resulting number is 
multiplied by 100, 200, 300, or 400 and the enemy takes that much damage.

Level 2 Limit Break

Slots: You get to try your luck at a slot machine to determine the attack used.  
There are eight attacks total:

Toy Box - When you don't get three of a kind, you get a random item from the Toy 
Box dropped on the enemy group.  This can be a Fat Chocobo, icicles, a huge 
weight, etc.

Toy Soldiers - When you get three Crowns, Cait Sith summons an army of small toy 
soldiers who attack enemies at random for fairly heavy damage each.

Mog Dance - Incorrectly named, you get MOOGLE (not MOG, dammit!!) DANCE when you 
get three Stars.  Moogle Dance causes a moogle to appear and completely restore 
the party.  This is one of the best and most common results.

Lucky Gal - When you score three Hearts, a cute girl dressed as a bunny appears 
and blows all of your party members a kiss, which makes every hit during the 
battle a critical hit until the end of the battle.

Random Summon Spell - When you get three Bars, a random Summon Spell (out of the 
ones you've gotten so far) will be cast on the enemies, at no MP cost for you.  
Unfortunately, this means that you'll never have a chance of scoring Knights of 
the Round at an early part of the game.  ^_~

Combine - When you get three Cait Siths, Cait Sith becomes one with the party 
members.  Cait Sith's new HP total is that of everyone's max HP added together 
(ex. Cloud has 1000 max HP, Red XIII has 1500 max HP, and Cait Sith as 2000 max 
HP, 2000+1500+1000 = 4500 max HP).  Mega Cait Sith's attacks to fairly massive 
damage.

All Over - When you score Cait Sith's face, all enemies in the battle are killed 
instantly, regardless of whether they have protection from it or not.  Watch 
out, though - if you mess up, you may accidentally get..

Joker Death - When Cait Sith gets a Bar instead of the right side of his face, 
all enemies die instantly.. but so do you.  Ribbons do not prevent this.  Game 
Over.  Hope you saved recently.  ^_^;;

- Cid Highwind -

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Boost Jump: Cid leaps high into the air, and then lands on a single enemy, 
spear-first, for moderate damage.

Dynamite: Cid whips out a stick of dynamite, lights it with his cigarette, and 
throws it into the midst of the enemy group, hitting them all for light damage.  
Cool.

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Hyper Jump: Cid leaps high into the sky, and then lands hard, creating a blast 
of energy that hits all enemies for moderate damage.

Dragon: Cid summons a dragon that appears and attacks one enemy for light 
damage.  Cid then gains that enemy's current MP worth of HP and MP.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Dragon Dive: Cid jumps high into the sky and lands on the enemies, spear-first, 
six different times, hitting enemies at random for light to moderate damage.

Big Brawl: Cid jumps into the middle of the enemy group and launches an eight-
hit combo that hits enemies at random for light damage each (a little weaker 
than Dragon Dive, but hits two more times).

Level 4 Limit Break

Highwind: Cid signals to the Highwind, which responds by firing 18 missiles at 
the enemy group, hitting them at random for light damage each.

- Yuffie Kisaragi -

Level 1 Limit Breaks

Greased Lighting: Yuffie cuts deep into one enemy for moderate damage.

Clear Tranquil: Yuffie surrounds each of her party members with a blue aura, 
which heals them to 50% of their current max HP (i.e, 1000 HP would be restored 
to someone with 2000 max HP).

Level 2 Limit Breaks

Landscaper: Yuffie creates a giant shockwave that runs along the ground, hitting 
all enemies for moderate damage.

Bloodfest: Yuffie launches into a ten-hit combo, which hits enemies at random 
for light damage each hit.

Level 3 Limit Breaks

Gauntlet: Yuffie creates a giant blast of energy that hits all enemies for 
equally heavy damage, regardless of their defenses.

Doom of the Living: Similar to Bloodfest, Yuffie launches into a 15-hit combo 
that creates cool purple explosions when they hit for the same light damage.

Level 4 Limit Break

All Creation: Yuffie creates a massive, luminescent energy wave that blows away 
all enemies for lethal damage (9999 HP in the later levels).

- Vincent Valentine - 

Vincent has four Limit Breaks in which he turns into a various beasts.  Each 
beast cannot be controlled, and they have two attacks that they use at random.  
This obviosuly has its advantages and disadvantages.

Level 1 Limit Break

Galian Beast: Vincent turns into a purple demon-beast with increased Speed, 
Evade %, and a 30% higher max HP level.  This is the fastest of Vincent's forms.

Berserk Dance - The Galian Beast launches a small combo on one enemy for light 
damage. 

Beast Flare - The Galian Beast creates orange orbs that explode around the 
enemies, hitting them all for fairly heavy Fire-Elemental damage.

Level 2 Limit Break

Death Gigas: Vincent turns into a Frankenstein-like creature with increased 
Defense Power and double the HP, but reduced Speed and low Magic Defense.

Gigadunk - The Death Gigas slams an enemy for heavy damage.

Livewire - The Death Gigas hits all enemies with a blast of electrical energy, 
for moderate Lightning-Elemental damage.

Level 3 Limit Break

Hell Masker: Vincent turns into a freaky horror-movie guy with a chainsaw who 
sports high Defense Power but low Attack Power.

Splattercombo - The Hell Masker hits a single enemy five times with his chainsaw 
for light damage each hit.  The total damage this does, though, is less than a 
single Gigadunk would do.

Nightmare - The Hell Masker hits one enemy with Sleep, Poison, Cofusion, 
Silence, Frog AND Mini conditions.  That's nice, but it only hits one enemy.

Level 4 Limit Break

Chaos: Vincent turns into an ultra cool Satan-demon like creature with 
incredibly high Attack Power, Defense Power, Magic Defense, and Speed.

Chaos Saber - Chaos uses his Chaos Saber to deliver the same damage as Gigadunk 
does.. but to every enemy!

Satan Slam - If the huge skull coming out of the ground doesn't kill every enemy 
instantly, then the flying skulls, which do massive damage to all enemies, will. 
^_^

V. Level 4 Limit Break Locations
--------------------------------

Here, you'll find all the locations of the Level 4 Limit Break items.  Remember, 
to use these items, the character must have mastered (learned) all six previous 
Limit Breaks.

- Cloud -

Omnislash: In Disc 2, win 32000 BP (Battle Points) at the Gold Saucer Battle 
Square, and exchange them for the Omnislash item.

- Tifa -

Final Heaven: After Cloud regains his senses in Mideel during Disc 2, go back to 
Nibelheim with Cloud in the lead and play Tifa's piano.  Play the following 
song: X, Square, Triangle, R1+Triangle, R1+Square, X, Square, Triangle, R1+X, 
Circle, X, Square, Triangle.  Not only will you find out what happened to Tifa 
after the Nibelheim incident, you'll get the Final Heaven item.

- Barret - 

Catastrophe: After you save North Corel from the Shinra Train (you have to save 
the town to get this) in Disc 2, go to the house on the west hill, and talk to 
the woman inside.  She'll give you the Catastrophe item as thanks for saving the 
town.  Cool.

- Aeris - 

Great Gospel: First, drive into Costa Del Sol with the Buggy and sneak a ride in 
the Shinra Boat.  Make your way out of Junon, and you'll find that you're still 
in your Buggy.  In this area, look for shallows that the Buggy can cross.  Once 
you cross the shallows, you'll come to the Sleeping Man's cave.  Talk to him, 
and he'll give you.. nothing.  But talk to him when you've run away a number of 
times where the last two digits in the number are the same (i.e. 11, 22, 33, 44, 
etc.), and he'll either give you a Lightning Ring or Mythril.  If you get the 
Lightning Ring, make the numbers match up again and talk to the Sleeping Man one 
more time.  In any case, once you get Mythril, you're in buisness.  Now head 
back to the Gongaga Area and look for the Blacksmith's house.  Give the Mythril 
to him, and he'll allow you to choose an item from either the small or large 
box.  Choose the small one; it contains the Great Gospel item!  The large one 
cantains Gold Armor.  Yay.  Remember, good things do come in small packages.  
This can only be done in Disc 1, for obvious reasons.

- Red XIII -

Cosmo Memory: During any Disc (preferably Disc 1), in the Shinra Mansion, open 
the safe using the combination Right 36, Left 10, Right 59, Right 97 before the 
time runs out.  If and when you open it, you'll fight a tough Boss, Lost Number.  
After defeating it, you'll not only get the Odin Summon Materia, but you'll get 
the Cosmo Memory item.

- Cait Sith -

Cait Sith does not have a Level 4 Limit Break.

- Cid -

Highwind: I can't give you specific directions to it, but it's hidden in the 
Downed Shinra Plane in Discs 2 and 3.  The item IS well-hidden, but it's worth 
it, just like every other treasure down there is.  Watch out for Emerald 
Weapon!!

- Yuffie -

All Creation: Defeat the five Gods of the Wutai Pagoda to recieve the Leviathan 
Summon Materia and the All Creation item.  This can be done during any Disc, but  
Disc 1 is preferable.

- Vincent - 

Chaos: Visit Lucrecia's Cave with Vincent in your party during Disc 2, and then 
visit again in Disc 3 with Vincent in your party.  Vincen't Ultimate Weapon and 
the Chaos item will be waiting for him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

------------------------------
VI. Ultimate Weapons Locations
------------------------------

In this section, I'll tell you where to find every character's Ultimate Weapon.  
Note that even though every Ultimate Weapon has four linked Materia slots and 
the highest Attack Power, it doesn't have ANY Materia growth rate, so it's kind 
of like a double-edged sword.

- Cloud - 

Ultima Weapon: In Disc 3, you may (and probably will) run into Ultimate Weapon 
while riding the Highwind in the Overworld.  You have to ram him with the 
Highwind to get him to attack you, and every time you defeat him, he'll run away 
temporarily.  Your only option, unfortunately, is to chase him in the Highwind 
again.  Once you defeat him enough (he has 100000 HP), he'll retreat to his 
final resting place, Cosmo Canyon.  Defeat him in that area, and he'll yield 
Cloud's Ultimate Weapon, the.. Ultima Weapon.  Additionally, he'll provide 
access to the Ancient Forest.

- Tifa - 

Premium Heart: In Disc 2 or 3, return to Bone Village and look for the "Sector 5 
Key" (mistranslation).  Once you dig it up, you'll be able to open the Sector 7 
Door that blocks your access to Midgar.  Not much has changed, but if you go to 
Wall Market and go to the room with the machine gun mounted on the ceiling, 
you'll find that the computer has been fixed.. temporarily.  Access it and 
you'll get Tifa's Ultimate Weapon, the Premium Heart.

- Barret - 

Missing Score: In Disc 2, during the raid of Midgar, you'll find the Missing 
Score in a treasure box on the stairs leading up to Hojo.. but only if Barret is 
currently in your party.  Bummer.  -_-

- Aeris -

Princess Guard: You can find Aeris' Ultimate Weapon, the Princess Guard, in the 
Temple of the Ancients, behind the IIII Door (yeah, IIII, not IV), during Disc 
1.  Seems a little late to be getting it, though..

- Red XIII -

Limited Moon: Return to Cosmo Canyon anytime in Disc 3 with Red XIII in your 
party, and speak to Bugenhagen.  A new event will unfold, and you'll end up 
getting Red XIII's Ultimate Weapon, the Limited Moon.

- Cait Sith - 

HP Shout: When you return to Midgar and raid the Shinra Building in Disc 2, 
return to the 64th Floor and check the locker that Cloud previously said he 
found a megaphone.  He'll realize that he needs it for Cait Sith now, and it 
just so happens to be Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon, the HP Shout.

- Cid -

Venus Gospel: When all of the Huge Materia events in Disc 2 are over, talk to 
the guy in Rocket Town who is sentimental about the rocket three times (you'll 
know him by the fact that all he does is look at it).  He'll give you Cid's 
Ultimate Weapon, the Venus Gospel.

- Yuffie - 

Conformer: In Disc 2 or 3, go to the Downed Gelnika plane and go to the 
Laboratory section (it's kinda hard to find as the door to that section isn't 
very well marked).  One of the items here is Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon, the 
Conformer.

- Vincent -

Death Penalty: In Disc 2, go to Lucrecia's Cave with Vincent in your party.  
Return in Disc 3, and you'll get Vincent's Ultimate Weapon, the Death Penalty 
(you get this at the same time you get his Level 4 Limit Break, Chaos).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
VII. Summon Materia Locations
-----------------------------

This section will help you to find each and every Summon Materia in the game.  
You don't want to miss any of them, because not only are they powerful, but they 
look incredibly cool too.

Choco/Mog: Find this at the Chocobo Ranch.  The first time you enter, talk to 
the Chocobo nearest to you.  Select "Wark!", and the Chocobos will do a cute 
little dance for you.  All of this concludes with you walking away with the 
Choco/Mog Summon Materia.

Shiva: Priscilla will give this Materia to you after you save her from 
Bottomswell in Junon, the first time you visit.

Ifrit: Jenova-BIRTH (on the Shinra Boat) will drop this when you beat her.

Ramuh: In the Chocobo Jockey Room you stay in when you're racing to escape from 
Corel Prison.  You'll know where it is by its flashing.

Titan: In Gongaga, check the location where Scarlet says she's found a "useless" 
Materia.  Titan maybe useless to her, but.. whatever.. ^_~

Odin: It can be found inside of the safe in the Shinra Mansion, once you beat 
the Boss of the safe, Lost Number.

Leviathan: Godo will give this Materia to Yuffie when she beats him at the top 
of the Wutai Pagoda.  You get this at the same time you get her Level 4 Limit 
Break item, All Creation.

Bahamut: The Red Dragon will drop this when you beat it inside of the Temple of 
the Ancients.

Kjata: Find this in the Sleeping Forest.  It's easy to miss, as it's hidden on 
the left side of the screen, and it appears and disappears at will.  When you 
see a shining red ball, go to where you see it and it will fall into your 
possesion soon enough.

Alexander: This one is incredibly hard to get (I missed it my first time through 
the Ice Gate).  I can't give you directions, so I suggest that you check out one 
of the great FAQs at GameFAQs that can.  I WILL tell you, however, that you 
first must dip your hands in the hot springs, and then touch the Ice Witch, who 
is found in an extremely out-of-the-way cave in the massive Ice Gate maze.  Good 
luck.  It's worth it.

Phoenix: Just win at the Fort Condor Huge Materia Event (either by doing the 
stupid war/strategy-game or by cranking up the speed and waiting for the Boss to 
come to you).  Either way, you'll get the Phoenix Summon Materia once you win.

Bahamut Neo: This one's extremely hard to miss.  It's laying right in the middle 
of your path through the Whirlwind Maze.

Hades: This one can be found in the Downed Gelnika Plane.  It's generally easy 
to find.  If you have THAT much trouble, just E-mail me.  ^_^

Bahamut ZERO: Examine the Blue Huge Materia when you have both Bahamut and 
Bahamut Neo in your posession, and you'll be given the almighty Bahamut ZERO 
Summon Materia.

Typoon: This can be found (although it's really not worth it) in the Ancient 
Forest.  It does look cool, but it just really sucks.

Knights of the Round: This legendary Materia can be found in the Round Island 
Materia Cave, which can only be reached on the back of a self-bred Gold Chocobo.  
See the Chocobo Breeding Section for more information.

IX. Emerald Weapon and Ruby Weapon
----------------------------------

This Section provides what I think are the best strategies for beating those two 
sons of bitches, Emerald and Ruby Weapon.  I DID beat them, by the way.  And 
yes, I am showing off.  ^_~

- Emerald Weapon - 

The "easier" of the two bosses, he's a sinch if you have the right Materia.  And 
without a GameShark, the right Materia will take ages to get.  First off, you 
need to eliminate that damned 20 minute timer Square threw in.  To do this, go 
to the Underwater Reactor and walk around in one of those big aqua tubes until 
you fight a Ghost Ship enemy.  Now, Morph it using the "Morph" Materia.  Take 
the Item you get back to the man I call the "Kalm Dude" (in Kalm, obviously), 
and you'll get the Underwater Materia for it.  (No, this Materia is NOT used to 
revive Aeris.  Because Aeris CANNOT be revived.)  This will allow your party to 
breathe under water, eliminating the timer.  Now, you want three Mime Materia, 
Knights of the Round, some Turbo Ethers, and the Phoenix Summon Materia with a 
mastered Final Attack Materia linked to it.  Also, try to have an Enemy Skill 
Materia with Big Guard learned.  And high HP and MP Levels, and all of the 
Ultimate Weapons would help too.  Now, go find him, and get ready for a tough-
ass fight.  Immediately use Big Guard to boost your Defense.  Then, when the 
character with the Knights of the Round Materia is ready, cast it.  And the Mime 
it with the next character.  And then Mime it with the other character.  And 
Mime again.  And again.  And KotR to Emmy to Hell and back.  At one point, he 
will use his super-ultra-mega-death-blasto-destructo-hell-hahaha-attack.  In 
other words, he'll kill you no matter what (9999 on everyone).  Not to worry; 
you have your Phoenix and Revive combination.  Once you're back up and running, 
cast Big Guard again, and start the KotR chain again.  Remember, Emmy has 
1,000,000 HP, so it will take awhile.  But you'll win.  Once you do, you recieve 
the Earth Harp.  Take the Earth Harp back to the Kalm Dude and he'll give you a 
Master Magic, Master Summon, and Master Command Materia for your efforts.  
Congrats.

- Ruby Weapon - 

Ugh, I hate this thing.  It's at least 10 times harder than Emmy was.. and all 
you get is a stinkin' Gold Chocobo for it.  Oh, big deal.  You should've had one 
years ago by this point in the game.  Oh well.  Anyway, here's the deal: load 
one character (preferably with EXTREMELY high HP and MP levels, like Cloud) with 
the W-Summon Materia (Master), Knights of the Round (Master), Mime (Master), 
Final Attack linked to Revive (both Master), the Shield Materia (Master), a 
Ribbon, and the Mystile Armor (to have a 50% chance of avoiding Ruby's repeated 
Ultima-casting).  A few HP Plus Materias wouldn't hurt either.  Now, engage 
Ruby.  And keep engaging the damn thing until your He-Man/Woman character (the 
one with everything on him/her) is the lucky one to survive Ruby's Whirlsand 
attack (which throws a character out of the battle).  Then, cast Shield on 
yourself, and start miming Knights of the Round, and focus on the stalks.  One 
the stalks are down, focus on Ruby itself until she goes down.  If (and when) 
your Shield gives out, stop the chain, cast Shield again, use a Megalixir or 
Turbo Ether, and start the chain again.  Like Emmy, Ruby has 1,000,000 HP to 
chip away at, so.. good luck.  If you beat it, you'll recieve the Desert Rose.  
Take this back to the Kalm Dude, and he'll give you a Gold Chocobo.  Woo-hoo.  
Well, at least you can.. brag.  Or something.  Right, that's it.  Brag.  Yay.

X. Enemy Skills Guide
---------------------

This section will list all 24 learnable Enemy Skills (including Chocobuckle), 
what they do, what enemies they can be learned from, where those enemies are 
found, and how many MP it costs.

Angel Whisper:
Completely restores HP and Status of a single ally, and also works like Life 2 
if used on a dead ally.  You can learn it from the Pollensalita, in the Final 
Dungeon.  It costs 50 MP.

Aqualung:
Does a high amount of Water-Elemental damage to all enemies.  You can learn it 
from the Chimera in the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer, or from Jenova-LIFE.  
It costs 34 MP.

Bad Breath:
Attempts to inflict Poison, Sleep, Mini, Frog, and Confuse on all enemies.  
Doesn't work on some Bosses.  You can learn it from the Molbor, found on Gaea's 
Cliff.  It costs 58 MP.

Beta:
Does a moderate amount of Fire-Elemental damage to all enemies.  You can only 
learn it from the Midgar Zolom, and that's if you survive the attack anyway.  It 
costs 35 MP.

Big Guard:
One of the best Enemy Skills.  It casts Barrier, MBarrier, and Haste on all of 
your party.  You can learn it from the Beach Plug enemy, found on the Costa del 
Sol beach.  It costs a whopping 56 MP for one use, though..

Chocobuckle:
This is the single hardest Enemy Skill to get, but it can be very effective.  
First, fight the Mu enemies around the Chocobo Ranch, and stall until they cast 
their Enemy Skill, Level 4 Suicide, on you.  They rarely cast it, so prepare for 
a long battle.  Once you learn it, kill them and go to the Chocobo Ranch.  Buy 
three Mimett Greens, and then fight a Level 16 Chocobo (use "Sense" Materia to 
check).  Now, feed all three Mimett Greens to him, one after the other.  Once 
you've done that, use Level 4 Suicide on the poor guy.  He won't die, but he'll 
be so pissed off that he'll respond with Chocobuckle, allowing you to learn it.  
Well, that's it.  Now run away from hundreds of battles and you can do 9999 
damage to all enemies for a measly 3 MP.  Have fun.  ^_^

Death Force:
Attempts to cast Death Sentence on a single target, and/or kill the target 
instantly.  Doesn't work on Bosses.  It can be learned from the Adamantaimai in 
the area around Wutai.  It costs 3 MP.

Death Roulette:
One character in the battle, be it ally or enemy, will be killed instantly.  
Doesn't work on Bosses.  It can be learned from the Death Dealer in the Final 
Dungeon.  It costs 6 MP.

Death Sentence:
Inflicts one enemy with Death Sentence.  Doesn't work on Bosses.  You can learn 
it from the Sneaky Step or Death Spector in the Cave of the Gi.  It costs 10 MP 
to use.

Dragon Force:
One ally's Defense and Magic Defense is increased by 50%.  You can learn it from 
the Dark Dragon in the Final Dungeon.  Costs 19 MP to use.

Flame Thrower:
Does a moderate amount of Fire-Elemental damage to a single target.  You can 
learn it from the Archdragon in the Mythril Mine.  Costs 10 MP.

Frog Song:
Attempts to inflict Frog and Sleep on a single target.  Also heals a member who 
is a Frog.  Doesn't work on most Bosses.  It can be learned from the Touch Me 
(uh..) in the Gongaga Area.  Costs a whopping 120 MP..

Goblin Punch:
Does very light Non-Elemental damage to a single target.  If target is the same 
Level as user, it will do heavy Non-Elemental damage.  Learn it from the Goblin 
on Goblin Island.  Costs 0 MP, as it's pretty damn useless..

Laser:
Reduces a single target's HP by 50% (if it has 6000 HP, will hit for 3000).  
Doesn't work on Bosses.  Learn it from the Bull Motor in Corel Prison.  Costs 16 
MP.

Level 4 Suicide:
Inflicts Death Sentence and Mini on targets whose Level is a multiple of 4 (4, 
8, 12, 16, etc..).  Doesn't work on Bosses.  Learn it from the Mu in the area 
around the Chocobo Ranch.  Costs 10 MP.

Level 5 Death:
Instantly kills all enemies whose Level is a multiple of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 
etc..).  Doesn't work on Bosses, obviously.  Learn it from the Parasite in the 
Final Dungeon.  Costs 22 MP.

Magic Breath:
Does moderate to heavy Fire, Water, and Lightning-Elemental damage to all 
enemies.  Learn it from the Stilv in Gaea's Cliff.  Costs 75 MP.

Magic Hammer:
Steals 100 MP (if possible) from a single target.  Learn it from the Razor Weeds 
in the Wutai area.  Costs 120 MP.

Matra Magic:
Does light Non-Elemental damage to all enemies.  Learn it from the Custom 
Sweepers in the Midgar Area.  Costs 8 MP.

Pandora's Box:
Hits all enemies for moderate to heavy Non-Elemental damage.  Learn it from the 
Dragon Zombie in the Final Dungeon.  Costs a whopping 110 MP.

Shadow Flare:
Hits one enemy for extrememly heavy Non-Elemental damage.  Learn it from Ultima 
Weapon, as his last resort death attack.  If he hits someone other than the 
person with E. Skill equipped, just reset and try again, because this is worth 
having.  Costs 100 MP for every use..

Trine:
Does a moderate amount of Lightning-Elemental damage to all enemies.  Learn it 
from the Materia Keeper (Boss) on Mt. Nibel, or from the Stilv, at Gaea's Cliff.  
Costs 20 MP.

White Wind:
Refills HP of all allies by an amount equal to the caster's current HP level.  
Learn it from the Zemzelett, in the area around Junon.  You must have the 
"Manipulate" Materia, because he will (obviously) never use it on you willingly.  
Costs 34 MP.

????: (Yes, that's what it's called)
One target takes an amount of Non-Elemental damage equal to that of your Max HP 
level, minus your current HP level.  Learn it from the Judge in the Shinra 
Mansion.  It costs 3 MP.

XI. Chocobo Breeding
--------------------

This section will teach you how to breed that damned elusive Gold Chocobo.  
Remember, Chocobo Breeding can be started as early as Mid-Disc 2.  The sooner 
you get Knights of the Round, the better.  The following is a list of the 
different types of Chocobos and what they can do:

---

Yellow Chocobo: The Normal Chocobo.  It can run across fields, and not much 
else.
Green Chocobo: The Mountain Chocobo.  It can run across fields, and pass 
mountains with ease.
Blue Chocobo: The River Chocobo.  It can run across fields, and wade through 
shallow water and rivers easily.
Black Chocobo: The Mountain/River Chocobo: It can run across fields, climb 
mountains, AND wade through rivers.
Gold Chocobo: The Sea Chocobo.  It can do everything the other Chocobos can, and 
can also run across the sea, letting you go anywhere.

---

This is a list of the different Greens and the stats they raise.  Always buy 
Greens from the Chocobo Sage, as he has the best and most rare ones.

Gysahl Greens: 100 Gil: Raises Speed and Stamina.  1 Green will do nothing; 10 
Greens will yield a .7% increase in Stam.; 30 Greens will yield a 6.7% increase 
in Speed and a 2.8% increase in Stam.

Krakka Greens: 250 Gil: Raises Intelligence.

Tantal Greens: 400 Gil: Raises Stamina and Intelligence.  1 Green will do 
nothing; 10 Greens will raise Stam. by 2.2%; 30 Greens will raise Stam. by 
11.1%.

Pashana Greens: 400 Gil: Raises Intelligence and Tameness.

Curiel Greens: 1000 Gil: Raises Speed and Stamina.  1 Green will do nothing; 10 
Greens will raise Stam. by 3.2%; 30 Greens will raise Speed by 5.7% and Stam. by 
9%.

Mimett Greens: 1500 Gil: Raises Speed.  1 Green will do nothing; 10 Greens will 
raise Speed by 7.7%; 30 Greens will raise Speed by 17.9%.

Reagan Greens: 3000 Gil: Raises Speed and Stamina.  1 Green will raise Stam. by 
1%; 10 Greens will raise Speed by 25% and Stam. by 12%; 30 Greens will raise 
Speed by 79% and Stam. by 36.4%.

Sylkis Greens: 5000 Gil: Raises Speed, Stamina, Intelligence, and Tameness.  1 
Green will raise Speed by 11.4% and Stam. by 3.1%; 10 Greens will raise Speed by 
68% and Stam. by 22.3%; 30 Greens will raise Speed by 75.9% and Stam. by 119%.

NOTE: Reagan Greens and Sylkis Greens are only available from the Chocobo Sage.

---

The following is a step-by-step walkthrough of raising a Gold Chocobo.

Step 1: Go to the Chocobo Ranch and buy as many Chocobo Pens as you can, with 
the money you have (you'll need a lot).
Step 2: Catch two "Good" Chocobos, found at the Chocobo Tracks near the Gold 
Sacuer.  Now, feed them both the Greens they need until you raise their stats 
(Speed, Stamina, Intelligence, and Tameness) to their maximum levels (not too 
hard, since these are relatively basic Chocobos).  Now, race them until they get 
to at LEAST A Class in the Chocobo Races, and bring them back to their Pens.  
Now go to the Icicle Area (right next to the Chocobo Sage's house) and fight a 
Brachioladus.  Steal a Carob Nut from it.  Go back to the Chocobo Ranch.  
***SAVE***.  Breed your two Chocobos together using the Carob Nut.  If you get a 
Blue Chocobo or Green Chocobo of either gender, congrats!  Keep it!  If you just 
get another Yellow Chocobo, reset and try again since you just saved.  Keep 
trying until you get a Blue or Green Chocobo of either gender.  
Step 3: Repeat Step 2 completely, and keep resetting until you get:
- A Green Male Chocobo if you bred a Blue Female the first time
- A Green Female Chocobo if you bred a Blue Male the first time
- A Blue Male Chocobo if you bred a Green Female the first time
- A Blue Female Chocobo if you bred a Green Male Chocobo the first time
Personally, I got a Green Male and a Blue Female.
Step 4: Raise both the Blue and Green Chocobos to at least A Class (S Class is 
better), get another Carob Nut, go to back to the Chocobo Ranch, and SAVE.  
Breed the Blue and the Green Chocobo using the Carob Nut, and you'll probably 
get a Black Chocobo of either gender.  That's what you want.  If you got a Black 
one, congrats!  Go on to the next step!  If not, keep trying until you do.
Step 5: Go to the Frozen Continent and find the Chocobo Tracks there, and catch 
as many Yellow Chocobos as your number of free Pens will allow.  Then, go back 
and have them rated.  Chances are you'll have a "Wonderful" Chocobo (they're 
only found there).  If you don't, don't despair; they're very rare, and you may 
have to try multiple times to get one.  Once you get a Wonderful Chocobo, MAKE 
SURE IT IS THE OPPOSITE SEX OF YOUR BLACK CHOCOBO (I needed a Female), and raise 
that and your Black Chocobo up to S Class (MUST be S Class).  
Step 6: Once your Black Chocobo and Wonderful Yellow Chocobo are champion 
racers, go to Goblin Island and fight some Goblins.  Steal a Zeio Nut from them.  
Go back to the Chocobo Ranch, and mate your Black Chocobo and your Wonderful 
Yellow Chocobo together, using your new Zeio Nut.  If both parents were S Class 
like I suggested, and you used the Zeio Nut to breed them, you hve a pretty good 
chance of getting your Gold Chocobo.  It may take a few tries though; I had 
champion racers and di everything perfectly, and it still took me like 15 tries.  
So, have patience and you'll get one eventually.  Congrats!  Now go get Mime, 
HP<--->MP, Knights of the Round, and Quadra Magic!

XII. Crazy Materia Combinations
-------------------------------

Here, you'll find some Materia combinations that are stupidly powerful, 
extremely effective, or just plain whacked out weird.  ^_~

Quadra Magic + Fire, Added Cut + Fire, MP Turbo + Fire, Added Steal + Fire, 
MP Absorb + Fire, Magic Counter + Fire, HP Absorb + Fire, W-Magic, Magic Plus
(All Fire Mastered, Quadra Magic Mastered)

- This combo casts Fire 3 at random targets four times, pausing in between to 
steal the target's possesion before dying and giving the caster a HP and MP 
bonus.  Then, you perform a normal attack, and then.. thanks to W-Magic, it 
HAPPENS ALL OVER AGAIN!!  Kill those bastards!!  :D

Quadra Magic + Contain, W-Magic
(Quadra Magic and Contain Mastered)

- This combo is basic, but the results are devastating.. to the enemies, that 
is.  With a Mastered Quadra Magic and a Mastered Contain linked together, you 
will cast all of Contain's four ultra-powerful spells.. twice.  Yes, twice for 
EACH Spell.  Now, throw in that W-Magic and you'll do it all over again.. for a 
total of 16 devastating Spells.  Even Seraph Sephiroth would have a bad time 
with this.  :D

Deathblow + Added Cut, Deathblow + Added Steal, MP Absorb + Deathblow
(All high levels)

- This isn't quite as revolutionary as the two combos before this, but it's 
still effective nonetheless.  First off, if you use Deathblow every turn, not 
only will you attack twice every turn and do double damage when you DO hit, 
you'll also attempt to steal, and with MP Absorb, you can absorb MP at the same 
time!  Ok, so it's not so amazing, but.. I like it.. ^_~

Magic Counter + Comet, Command Counter + Deathblow, Counter Attack (as many as 
you have), Defend, HP Plus (a lot of 'em)
(All at Master or high levels)

- Let's get to the point.  When the enemy attacks the lucky character, he's 
&%^$ed.  First, he gets himself stuck with three regular attacks, a Deathblow, 
and a shitload of comets.  And none of your members have even had their turns 
yet.  'Nuff said.

XIII. Conclusion
----------------

Well, I hope you enjoyed my latest (and biggest so far) FAQ.  I know it's an 
older game, but it's an instant classic, and is one of THE best games ever made.  
The only games I think surpass it are Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 
VI, and Final Fantasy Tactics.  So, dust off that FFVII game and get everything 
you missed the first time.. because trust me, it's hella fun.  Look for more 
FAQs from me soon!  Later!  ^_^

XIV. Thanks

First and foremost, I'd like to thank Versus Books for their Unofficial Final 
Fantasy VII Ultimate Guide.  Without it, many sections of this FAQ would not 
have been possible.  Secondly, kudos go to BradyGAMES for their Officiall Final 
Fantasy VII Strategy Guide.  Although not as good as the former, it helped me.  

Well, no one has submitted anything yet, so.. that's it.  Later, everyone.
