NOTE: From now on 1/10 Final Fantasy 7 messages regarding how to beat the
      game will be answered. If you ask me a question already on the
      walkthrough, your email will be submarily deleted. Use Crtl+F to search
      what you are looking for. Even if you beg me to read the email I will
      most definitely delete the message. Too many stupid questions already
      in the walkthrough has been asked of me. I got over 200 email 
      regarding this game alone, I will delete those with the subject Final
      Fantasy 7 on it. If you do subject a title something else, but you
      ask a Final Fantasy question on the message, your email will be
      permanently blocked, no ifs ands or buts about it. I updated this
      FAQ massively, in hopes that questions will be answered in the FAQ.
      I've included everything to make sure dumb emails won't come to me
      again. If I'm in a good mood, I'll answer your email, but when I see
      another FF7 question that puts me out on a bad mood. If you want to
      talk that's fine, but I know what is in my FAQ and what is not. I
      will read your message occasionally and decide what to and what not
      to reply, and if you flame me or criticize me negatively I will send
      a flame right back at you and block your email address so that you
      can never contact me again unless you create a new email account and
      behave. This is also quite possibly the LAST time I will ever update
      the FAQ. If enough requests comes in(which I doubt) the FAQ will be
      updated if you are specific in which areas needs to be updated. Also
      take a look at Mr.Prolific's million dollar worth FF7 FAQ, its great
      and has massive information only Kao Megura can provide all at

                                www.gamefaqs.com

    Well I've finally corrected my mistakes with the help of 50+ different 
    individuals about my brief review of FF7. I thank those people who have 
    been polite and telling me about this major error I had put up, and I 
    have even recieved threats! I mean come on, this is just a game and 
    people all have different opinions, and for those people who claim they 
    can bench press me, all I have to say is bull! Now these days anybody can 
    talk however they want over the internet because you don't know the 
    person. Well thanks to all those people who have helped me correct my 
    problem with the utmost respect, and for those people who have hated me 
    for putting up those questions they should just go home and ask their 
    parents why haven't they taught their kids some respect!

    Congratulations! You have purchased one of the best 15 games of all time! 
    Okay so I'm a little late on this guide and its been a year and a half 
    since this game came out, but I haven't had the time to compose a FF7 FAQ 
    because of school. Well now on to the FAQ!

    I know they'll be some mistakes on the way and if so tell me. Now on to 
    the FAQ.

CLOUD STRIFE
    At age 16 Cloud dreamed of becoming a SOLDIER, mainly because he idolized 
    Sephiroth. With his hometown set on fire and Sephiroth leaving many dead 
    he and ZACK was later caught by Hojo's henchmen and put in a giant Mako 
    tube to see if they would have the neccessary properties to become 
    SOLDIER. Apparently they both didn't fit the requirements. During one of 
    there daily meals they both escaped and set foot to Midgar. But Cloud is 
    the only mercenary Barret could hire for 2000 Gil, so what happened to 
    Zack? Fing out in the side area under LOST MEMORY. Cloud is the character 
    that will be with you 90% of the time as your leader so you can't put him 
    out of your group. You won't regret having him in your party because his 
    powerful sword attacks are only rivaled by Sephiroth. He avid Mat user, 
    but he's not always the best. His limit breaks are highly desvestaing and 
    will become quite useful all the way through the game just make sure to 
    switch Limit Breaks as he advances to the next level.

--------------------------------[ LEVEL 1: ]---------------------------------

Braver
    A highly powerful single slash that can be very damaging early on. This 
    limit break is double the strength of Cloud's regular attacks. Good for 
    bosses or a strong enemy.

Cross-Slash
    This limit break is the same as above, but this can cause paralysis 
    except on most bosses.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 2: ]---------------------------------

Blade Beam
    This is a highly effective Limit Break against a group of enemies because 
    the single slash will serverely damage a targeted enemy while smaller 
    waves do weaker damage on all other near by opponents. 

Climhazzard
    This limit break is best used agaist a boss or single strong enemy 
    because it only hits once but that hit is stronger than the blade beam 
    attack. Its probably wasted on a group.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 3: ]---------------------------------

Meteorain
    A highly powerful attack that can cause up to 20,000 HP of DMG depending 
    on the strength of your sword. This attack is great against a single 
    opponent or groups because it hits 4 times causing lots of damage. Its 
    better if this is used on a boss.

Finishing Touch
    In my opinion the weaker of the Level 3 limit break. This attack will 
    blow away any weak enemies into oblivion and if the opponent is not 
    automatically dead then it takes servere damage. In my opinion its almost 
    wasted on a boss because it'll never do as much damage to a boss as 
    Meteorain because it only hits once. Just save this for groups.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 4: ]--------------------------------

Omnislash
    A highly powerful sword attack that hits probably 20 times that does  
    serveral thousand points of damage each hit. If used against a boss it'll 
    more than likely kill him. If used against a group of enemies it'll kill 
    them too. Either way you'll always tip the advantages to your side. 
    REMEMBER the stronger the sword the stronger the slashes. If cloud is 
    equipped with the Ultima Weapon and his strength is around the 200 area 
    he can cause up to 200,000 HP of damage!! That should scare off the 
    weapons! Early on it'll cause about 35,000 HP of damage.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Barret Wallace
    The 35-year old AVALANCHE veteran doesn't know when to quit when it comes 
    against Shinra. He is the leader of the AVALANCHE group and has high 
    priority with his long range weapons. He thinks that Shinra is 
    responsible for the death of his wife and often regrets not nuturing 
    Marlene. His hometown in Corel use to be a clean environment and was the 
    best place around the globe to mine. Now its nothing but a junkyard with 
    innocent lives living in shacks and tents due to Shinra's Mako reators.  
    Its best if you put him in the back only if you have a long range weapon. 
    This is the best time to load him with materia. If he has a short range 
    weapon put him up front and deequip only the materia the lessens his 
    performance like summon or magic materia.  

---------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]---------------------------------

Big Shot
    As Barret gathers his ammo into a single shot a giant red fireball 
    appears infront of his gun causing heavy direct damage against one 
    opponent. This is best used for bosses.

Mind Blow
    Its not for offense but in some cases its a highly affective attack. 
    It'll drain about 100MP from an opponent making happy magic users into 
    sad defenseless wimps. 


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]---------------------------------

Grenade Bomb
    As Barret throws a highly explosive bomb at opponents it causes a good 
    amount of damage against a group of enemies. This is best used for 
    groups, but you should also use this against a boss because the 
    Hammerblow isn't a good choice(read below).

Hammerblow
    As Barret punches the daylight out of an opponent the opponent is 
    automatically out of battle and cannot return and you still gain the 
    opponents expierience. The bad news is, is that it cause no damage and 
    will not work on any bosses.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]---------------------------------

Satellite Beam
    Barret calls upon his friends at AVALANCHE to target a satellite against 
    a group of enemies cause massive damage. Early on this will cause about 
    3000-4000 HP of damage, but as you progress his levels they can do twice 
    as much damage if not more. This is best used against a group of enemies.

Ungarmax
    Barret goes berserk with his gun as he empties his ammo against a group 
    or an opponent. This hits about 10 times, but is best used against a 
    boss. The strength of each hit is about the same as Barret's regular 
    attacks so save it for a boss.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]---------------------------------

Catastrophe
    A giant super heated flare is unloaded against a group of enemies or a 
    single boss causing an unbelievable amount of damage. This hits about 15 
    times each hit doing 3000 HP of damage and sometimes a few of the hits 
    can cause up to 6000 or even 9000 points of damage depending on his 
    strength. If you can max out Barret's levels and give him about 20 power 
    source and have him equipped with his Missing Score you cause almost 
    50,000 HP of damage!

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Tifa Lockheart
    A beautiful girl with deadly martial arts attack power. She doesn't need 
    a weapon except a glove and can cause just as much damage with her fist 
    as Cloud can cause with his sword. When she was about 8 she fell off 
    Mt.Nibel and was in a coma for days and her parents blamed Cloud even 
    though he was only following her from a distance while being at the wrong 
    place at the wrong time. She later joined Barret's AVALANCHE group in the 
    fight against Shinra and she will try everything in her power to keep 
    Cloud at her side even thoguh she would never admit that she has a crush 
    on Cloud. Early on Tifa can chain all her limit breaks so she doesn't 
    need to switch limit breaks and later can chain all 7 hits for monster 
    damage. They're are slots though when you stop at "MISS" she'll miss that 
    part of the limit break if you score a "yeah" she'll deliver up to twice 
    as much damage but it's pretty hard to score a yeah because its between 
    all the "miss" slots. If she scores a "hit" she'll still deliver a 
    punishing blow and these are very easy to get.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]---------------------------------

Beat Rush
    A series of blazing fast attacks to a single opponent will most likely 
    injure them. 

Somersault
    A powerful flip kick that causes alot of damage as she puts on hit number 
    2.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]---------------------------------

Waterkick
    Tifa sends the enemy down with a sweeping waterkick. Don't worry she 
    won't gain any lives against a water base creature as she tacks on hit 
    number 3.

Meteordrive 
    Not only a martial arts expert but she can also deliver a painful 
    backdrop causing a wave of damage.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]---------------------------------

Dolphin Blow
    As Tifa calls upon a Dolphin she tacks on hit number 5 causing servere 
    damage.

Meteor Strike
    A super version of the Meteordrive that sends the opponent high above 
    then crushes the opponent with a devestating drop.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]---------------------------------

Final Heaven
    Summoning all the energy into her fist Tifa delivers a nasty blow thats 
    more than likely to destroy an opponent with ease as Tifa adds the Final 
    hit number 7.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Aeris Gainsborough
    A gorgeous 22 year old girl is a luminous spot in the dark and misty 
    Midgar. Aeris holds the secret to the land of the ancients and that has 
    why Shinra has followed her for life in hopes to be lead to the fabled 
    promise land. Aeris first meets Cloud while selling flowers on the street 
    after the first reactor exploded. Aeris can be put up front as a fighter 
    which isn't a bad idea but she would serve alot better if she was a heavy 
    materia user. She has a very high magic power than anyone else so put her 
    in the back and let her be the medic and equip her with lots of materia. 
    Her Limit breaks aren't offensive based but they can be just as 
    effective.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]--------------------------------

Healing Wind
    Aeris calls upon the white wind to heal the party of any lost HP. Quite 
    useful throughout the game. 

Seal Evil
    As Aeris uses her magic power she can parylize the enemy and stop them 
    from using any magic.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]--------------------------------

Breath of the Earth
    Until you have a ton of remedies, equipped with a Ribbon or have the 
    Esuna spell this should prove handy. This will not heal the party and if 
    your party is not affected by anything negative this Limit Break will be 
    completely wasted and this also takes away your WALL or REGEN.

Fury Brand
    Aeris will risk her limit breakand instantly fill her party member's 
    guages. So unless both of your other party members are near their limit 
    breaks this should come quite handy in close fights.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]---------------------------------

Planet Protector
    As Aeris uses her limit break to to form a shield around her party 
    members they are invincible for a few rounds.

Pulse of life
    Sorta like the Healing Wind and Breath of the Earth combined but comes 
    with two added bonuses, it'll completely restore your MP and will cast 
    LIFE2 on any pary member.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]---------------------------------

Great Gospel
    This is the combination of both Level 3 limit breaks but the barrier 
    lasts longer. Extremely useful throughout the game.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Red XIII
    Once believed to be human but was a product of one of Shinra's Mako 
    expierments and as a result he is an animal with a extremely high 
    intellect and has a slow cell rate and as a result he can live 10 times 
    longer than that of any human.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]--------------------------------

Sled Fang
    This attack is twice as strong as Red's physical attack and will hit any 
    long range enemies.

Lunatic High
    Until you have the Time materia this should come in handy through many 
    battles to come. With this limit break Red will cast haste on the Entire 
    Team.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]--------------------------------

Blood Fang
    Much like the Sled Fang but stronger and will absorb some HP and MP 
    depending on how much the opponent has. This is a better chioce but you 
    gain about 200-500 HP and 200 MP.

Stardust Ray
    This can cause up to 30,000 HP of damage because it hits alot, and this 
    works well against a group of enemies or a single opponent. Depending on 
    your levels this will already cause more damage than the Cosmo Memory.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]--------------------------------

Howling Moon
    After he uses this limit break he automatically casts HASTE and BERSERK 
    on himself leaving him uncontrollable for the remainder of the battle. 

Earth Rave
    Using all elements of the Earth this causes a hugh amount of damage to 
    all opponents. Be careful when using this against some enemies because 
    you might gain them HP.


----------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]--------------------------------

Cosmo Memory
    A giant Fireball is summoned causing unbelievable damage to all enemies. 
    Don't worry this isn't elemental. There is one problem though, it only 
    hits once for a lousy 10,000 HP of DMG. That just won't cut it against 
    most enemies. It's better if you stick with his Earth Rave or Stardust 
    Ray.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Cid Highwind
    By his last name you can tell that he's the pilot of the game. He hasn't 
    once forgotten his dreams of going into outer space. This tough talking 
    bad mouthing guy has a warm heart and aborted a space launch to save the 
    life of his wife Shera. Now he blames her for ruining his dreams because 
    the rocket is now inoperable and Cid spends countless hours fixing it and 
    someday hopes that the new president of Shinra Rufus will fund the new 
    rocket in hopes of fullfilling his dreams. Cid is the most agile 
    character in the whole game in my opinion. He has superior fighting 
    skills and knows the skill of materia. No matter how you use him he will 
    always have more advantages than disadvantages. His limit breaks are one 
    of the best. When you ride your Chocobo at Gold Saucer he will often ask 
    to ride it, but you have the choice of letting Cloud ride it as well.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]----------------------------------

Boost Jump
    Twice the damage of his normal attack Cid will literally destroy the 
    opponent early on.

Dynamite
    Cid will light a stick of dynamite with his cigar and throw it at the 
    opponent. Great against a group of enemies but doesn't rely on his weapon 
    to determine damage but his vitality.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]----------------------------------

Hyper Jump
    A stronger version of Dynamite and works well against a group of strong 
    enemies. This causes death sometimes and if you use this against an 
    undead monster you'll heal it.

Dragon
    As a Dragon appears it critically damages an opponent and Cid is allowed 
    to absorb some MP and HP in the process.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]----------------------------------

Dragon Dive
    In my opinion the best of his Level 3 Limit break. Practically the best 
    Level 3 limit break in the game offensively and this hits 6 times causing 
    a load of damage. If each hit can do 9999 DMG this limit can cause up to 
    60,000 HP worth of damage.

Big Brawl
    This will hit about 12 times of his regular attack strength. A great 
    attack against a group or an enemy.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]----------------------------------

Highwind
    As Cid calls upon the Highwind and his crew unleashes 30+ missiles each 
    causing up to 3000-6000 HP of damage each. Obviously his best Limit. The 
    damage will pile up pretty quick so don't expect to try to count how many 
    times it connects unless you can record it on tape and watch it in slow-
    mo.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Yuffie Kisaragi
    As a 16-year old she is a very sneaky theif and steals from a whole bunch 
    of defenseless travelers that is until she met her match with Cloud's 
    group. She is incredibly greedy and a common theif. Being a descendant of 
    many ninja generations she has high fighting skills and will help the 
    party out in any way she can IF you know how you get her(read at the end 
    titled SIDE AREAS).


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]----------------------------------

Greased Lightning
    Even though the title may fool you, its not an elemental attack. It's a 
    real quick attack that causes up to twice the normal damage.

Clear Tranquil
    This is extremely useful throguhout the entire game. If you can max out 
    her levels she can gain the party up 7000 HP.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 2 ]----------------------------------

Landscaper
    This is a powerful attack that does heavy damage on a group of enemies as 
    she summons an earthquake that rises against the opposition. Best against 
    groups.

Bloodfest
    A series of 12 damaging blows each 1/2 the normal attack strength. Great 
    against a group of 3 or a strong lone attacker.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 3 ]----------------------------------

Guantlet
    A giant blue light is summoned beaneath the opponent causing a ton of 
    damage against a group of a single opponent. When your levels are maxed 
    out this will most likely be just as strong as her All Creation.

Doom of the Living
    This will do a ton of damage depending on which weapon is equipped. Same 
    as the Bloodfest but she attacks at normal strength.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 4 ]----------------------------------

All Creation
    This might actually be the most useless Level 4 limit break in the game. 
    This will cause up to a mere 10,000 HP of damage. This only hits once but 
    hits all enemies. If you like special effects this is your limit other 
    wise just stick with her Level 3.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


Vincent Valentine
    With a dark exterior its a sure bet he's working for Shinra right? Wrong. 
    After going through a series of Mako expierments he can turn into any 
    beast he wishes. What if I were to tell you that Vincent and Sepiroth 
    were brothers? Well this can can be either false or true but follow the 
    storyline and you'll see. After a while you'll see a happy side of 
    Vincent and he evens says "cool" because Cloud thoguht he was a heartless 
    dark member of Shinra. Wow! Right? Well always keep Vincent in the back 
    because all his weapons are long ranged. Becareful of his Limit Breaks 
    though you won't be able to control him afterwards. But he does gain 
    twice his current MAX HP during battle and will be fully healed 
    regardless if he has low HP. Even after battle he should have full HP if 
    he doesn't lose half of his current HP or if he dies.


--------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]----------------------------------

Galian Beast
    As Vincent turns into a purple colored bull he will use some attacks that 
    are pretty helpful.

      Beast Flare-
         A giant amount of HP is lost from a group of enemies after they get 
         a taste of fire.

      Berserk Dance-
         A large amount of damage is incurred as he unleashes his physical 
         attack.

Cait Sith
    A giant stuffed Mog appears to CLoud as a fortune teller at first but 
    soon they realize his true idenity. Well you can say he's Setzer from 
    Final Fantasy 6 because he deals with casinos and has slots like Setzer 
    but you have to earn them. Cait Sith is really(wait I'm not gonna spoil 
    it!)... Although he looks durable he basically has the same defense as 
    any other character. Doesn't matter where you put him, but he works best 
    if you give him materia and have him attack physically.


---------------------------------[ LEVEL 1 ]---------------------------------

Dice
    A number of dices is thrown out and if he rolls a 6 that means 600 HP is 
    lost against the enemy. Caith Sith can have up to 8 dices causing up to

Slots
    This is his maximum limit break. There is one real nasty slot that you 
    should look out for that will kill your party. There's really no timing 
    involved in this. Once you stop at a star it'll most likely become 3 
    stars on the slots.

         A giant version of Cait Sith is formed and he will gain all 
         expierience and the party returns at the end and their HP is reduced 
         to 3333 and their MP to 333.

      3 Hearts-
         A female elf puts 3 hearts on the party members ensuring no misses 
         with attacks or magics.

      2 Cait Sith and 1 Bar-
         Instant death for all allies resulting in a game over. This is what 
         I was talking about, this is rare but save before you use his Level 
         2 Limit breaks.

      3 Cait Sith-
         Instant Victory that means you automatically win the battle. And for 
         those of you wondering, it won't work on bosses or the Weapons!

                            WALKTHROUGH

    Watch out this will contain a ton of spoilers so you might not want to 
    read on, but for whatever reason you want to pass through the game 
    quickly then read on.

=============================================================================

Mako Reactor #1
    In the beginning you see Aeris near the fireplace while handling some 
    flowers letting you sample the graphics engine and it even looks like a 
    real movie! Pretty nifty huh? Then you see a speeding train up ahead with 
    Cloud and Barret aboard. As you jump the guards make sure to pick up a 
    POTION left behind by each downed guard. You'll see 2 MPs at the end of 
    your walkway in which cloud easily destroys. When you reach the next room 
    talk with Biggs and Jessie and they'll open the gates. When you get 
    through go to the right to pick up a PHOENIX DOWN then head for the 
    elevator and follow Jessie into the reactor. She'll soon step aside to 
    let you through but make sure to pick up the POTION in front of her. As 
    you move along a pretty linear path enemies get stronger, but easily 
    conquered. You'll see a save point to the left of Cloud and just save the 
    game. You might want to fight a few battles before moving on to gain a 
    Level or 2 before moving on, but the Guard Scorpion is pretty easy to 
    defeat. Just as you get closer to the reactor you'll see a shining green 
    materia pick it up and receive the RESTORE MATERIA, don't equip it just 
    yet. As Cloud reaches the Reactor Core he'll set the bomb but that 
    triggers the alarm for the desfense mechanism, the Guard Scorpion.

BOSS FIGHT: Guard Scorpion HP:800 Item: Assult Gun(Barret)
    Just have Cloud use Constant Bolt spells and Barret attack with his 
    regular attacks. When Cloud Warns Barret to "Be careful" stop attacking 
    and if your HP is around the 100 area use POTIONS to heal the wounded 
    member if you attack it it'll counter with the Tail Laser causing 75-80 
    HP of DMG to each character. When it stops preparing for the Tail Laser 
    just repeat the attack pattern like before and he should be toast.

    Quickly head back out because you'll have 10 minutes to eascape. Make 
    sure to save as you see the save point because you will encounter some 
    hefty battles. When you encounter Jessie her foot will be stuck, help her 
    out so you'll be able to escape. Once you get to the security doors speak 
    with both Biggs and Jessie to poen the locks. Burn baby burn! With a 
    giant explosion Mako reactor No.1 explodes. That should show Shinra who 
    he's dealing with. Yeah!


AVALANCHE ESCAPES!
    You'll meet just outside the destroyed reactor and the Barret tells the 
    team to split up and meat becak at headquarters. Follow Barret and you'll 
    encounter a flower girl, tell her what happened and purchase a flower for 
    1 Gil and leave. As you exit out go south and pick up a POTION on the 
    way. Here Cloud will fight a couple of MPs, which is a good decision 
    since they are very weak, make your decision quick because the guards wil 
    get annoyed and initiate the fight anyways. When Cloud gets surrounded 
    he'll drop on the train headed for Sector 7 Slums just in time. When you 
    get on the train talk to everybody and you'll notice that you'll need 
    fake IDs to get through heavily guarded areas. 


THE HIDEOUT
    When the train arrives at the designation go into the bar. There's a save 
    point on the way but its not necessary. Here you'll get a chance to give 
    the flower you purchased earlier to either Marlene or Tifa, it doesn't 
    matter whom. When you speak with everybody Barret comes interupting 
    calling for the meeting downstairs. When everybody is gone speak with 
    Tifa, then head down to the pinball machine. When Cloud was little he 
    made a promise to Tifa about joining SOLDIER and protecting Tifa, now you 
    must stay with her! Now you recieve 3500 Gil from Barret for your work 
    and next mission.


RE-EQUIP and MOVE OUT!
    Go buy the armor for Cloud and Iron Bangles for both Barret and Cloud, 
    buy a third one for Tifa and pick up the ETHER and ALL MATERIA near the 
    ITEM SHOP. If you want you can pick up a FIRE MATERIA or another RESTORE 
    MATERIA, both are just optional, but if you are gonna get one stick with 
    the RESTORE MATERIA. Pair up the ALL MATERIA with RESTORE MATERIA to have 
    it handy because each cure spell can restore up to 400HP in a single 
    turn, but if you spread it outside or during battle each party member 
    will recive about 150-175 HP each. Now exit the gates and save. You can 
    explore if you want but its not necessary.


REACTOR NO.5
    Talk to Tifa and an alarm sounds. Quickly move on to the next car to 
    avoid being caught. When you enter the second car talk to the old bum and 
    he'll give you a PHEONIX DOWN. In the third car talk to the guy near you 
    to recieve the HI-POTION. Now ignore the guy stealing your items in the 
    next car and continue foward. When you reach the end talk to Tifa to bail 
    out. You'll only have 10 seconds in each cart to move out so make your 
    decisions quickly. If you were trapped in the first car you'll end up 
    near a tunnel guarded by endless Special Combatants, just listen to what 
    Cloud says and turn back. Now when you reach the end go to the left 
    control panel to get through the sensor nets. As you get through pick up 
    2 ETHERS on the way and continue down the ladder. When you reach a wide 
    wearhouse go down and take the next available ladder. When you reach 
    inside go to Cloud's left side in the corner to pick up a POTION. Now 
    continue to the ladder on your left side and follow the ladder until you 
    see a save point just ahead. Go and save it because a BOSS is right 
    around the corner. This place is similar to the first one. Just take the 
    staircase and continue down towards the screen and enter the room on the 
    left side of the screen. Climb down the ladder and reach the reactor core 
    and you'll see the storyline unfold a little bit. When Cloud sets the 
    bomb there's no need to rush because Cloud will detonate it once he's 
    outside. When you exit the place you'll encounter a control room with 
    switches that must be hit all at once. Just hit the O button and move on. 
    When you reach the next are you are forced to fight the Air Buster.

BOSS: Air Buster HP: 1000 Item: Titan Bangle
    This boss should be fairly easy but not for everybody. Always hit its 
    back to incur twice as much damage as your normal attacks. Have one of 
    your party members use BOLT on him constantly and use your Limit Breaks 
    whenever possible.

    After defeating this boss Cloud falls down into the Slums below.


SAVE AERIS NOW!
    When Cloud awakens he wakes up in a flower bed. This time you'll be 
    introduced to Aeris. But wait she'll ask you to be her Bodyguard and you 
    do. Then Reno of the Turks appear with three guards. When you both try to 
    escape the guards use their trusty machine guns and Aeris falls to the 
    floor below and the guards move in. Your given these commands for Aeris:

    "Fight"
    "Run"
    "Hold on a minute"

    Tell Aeris to hold on. Now move to the top floor of the church and you'll 
    see four barrels push the one on the left side of your screen in the 
    back. Next push the one in the center in the back and finally push the 
    one on the right side of your screen. The barrel in the center in the 
    front of the screen should never be touched. Once your done haed all the 
    way to the top of the church to escape through the broken roof ahead. 
    You'll encounter some enemies on the way but they shouldn't be much of a 
    threat. 


SECTOR 5 SLUMS
    When you get out Aeris will point the way to her house,but this place is 
    pretty linear. Just keep going to the left to Sector 5. When you reach 
    Sector 5 you'll see a save point, but it's not necessary to save yet, but 
    go ahead and save. On the next screen you'll see two guys blocking your 
    path to Sector 6, ignore them for now and go right into the light. When 
    you reach this area go to the Southeast corner and enter the house and 
    you'll see a boy who tells about 5 Gil in his dresser. If you take his 5 
    Gil you'll gain 5 Gil but if you don't you'll recieve the TURBO ETHER. 
    Considering an ETHER costs about 1500 Gil that means a TURBO ETHER would 
    most likely cost around 5000 Gil if not more. Its better if you leave his 
    money here, you can still chosse to read the magazines if you like. Now 
    go to Aeris' house which the entrance to her house is directly above the 
    boy's house. The shops in here are pretty much useless. Save your money 
    unless you decided to go for some new Materia or in a need of new 
    supplies of POTION, PHEONIX DOWN, ANTIDOTE, or a TENT. It's ideal to pick 
    up a TENT and about 6 POTIONs and two or three PHEONIX DOWNs or ANTIDOTEs 
    of each. When you reach Aeris' house go west to her garden and some items 
    are hidden along the bush area on the right and left sides of her garden. 
    Go all the way to the right of her garden to pick up an ETHER and go all 
    the way left to pick up a COVER MATERIA. It doesn't matter which one you 
    pick up, it's just that I pick them up in that order. Now go inside Aeris 
    house, there's a save point but its not necessary, and if you do happen 
    to save don't use your TENT because you'll be fully healed once you get 
    out of Aeris' house. During the middle of the night Aeris' stepmother 
    will ask you to leave without her because she knows Aeris will follow you 
    so you happily obliged. When you get out of her house just walk do not 
    dash, so in other words don't hold down the X button while walking 
    because it'll wake up Aeris. When you try to go to Sector 6 you'll notice 
    that Aeris has caught up to you! Now would be a good time to save it. 


SECTOR 6 and the WALL MARKET
    When you exit out of Aeris' house go to the place with the two guys 
    blocking the door. You'll notice that you can now go to Sector 6. When 
    you reach here its fairly linear and there's nothing inside the broken 
    crane machine. When you reach a worn out dusty playground Aeris and Cloud 
    will take a break. Wait a minute, who's that girl in the blue dress? And 
    why is she on a chocobo cart? No it couldn't be! It's Tifa! Wonder what 
    she's up to. For now just follow that cart! When you reach the Wall 
    Market go north of the Wall Market until you see a guy in front of 
    Corneo's mansion. He'll tell you that Corneo's not fond of men, but then 
    how do you get in? You can't beat him up because the game doesn't allow 
    it, but there's a better idea, get Cloud to look like a girl! Go back to 
    the south part of the Wall Market and enter the shop on your left. Now go 
    to the northern part of the wall market and go into the bar on the left. 
    When you talk the guy into making you a dress you'll be given a few 
    choices made my Aeris:

Something:
	that feels clean
	that feels soft
Something
	shiny
	shimmers

    It doesn't matter what you choose, but if you want the best disguise for 
    Cloud get something that is Soft and Shimmers. Now that you have a dress, 
    you'll need a wig. Now go southeast from the bar into the gym below. When 
    you enter inside you'll be entered in a squat contest. Just press the 
    "square," X, O button in that order. Don't press the next button until 
    the previous step has been fully completed. If you win you'll get a 
    Blonde Wig, which is the best wig. If you tie you'll get a dyed wig and 
    if you lose you'll get a plain wig. Now that you have the neccessary 
    items go foward to the dress shop and speak with the guy up front to go 
    in. If you want Cloud to be the "lucky gal" you must get Cloud some more 
    items, if you do not care just skip the next part and go back back to the 
    DRESS SHOP.

    Remember when the guy was trying to hold it in? You know when you were in 
    the bar and a lady was hogging the bathroom. Talk to that lady and she'll 
    say she needs some medicine, probably to keep her from throwing up too 
    much. Go back to the southern part of the Wall market and enter the 
    restaurant that's right in front of Cloud. When you go in just order a 
    meal and you'll recieve the coupon. Just make sure you have enough. Now 
    get out and go to the next shop that is directly south of the restaurant 
    and into the pharmacy. You are given the choice of:

Disinfectant
Deodorant
Digestive

    Choose the digestive and go back to the lady who's hoggin the bathroom 
    and she'll give you the SEXY COLOGNE. Then you see the guy waiting for 
    hours quickly rush to the bathroom. Now head to the Materia shop that's 
    in the northeast part of the southern part of the Wall Market. Speak to 
    the guy standing behind the counter and spend the night for 10 Gil and in 
    the middle of the night spend 200 Gil on the vending machine and in the 
    morning you'll get the Diamond Tiara. If you spent 100 Gil you'll get a 
    Ruby Tiara anything less you'll get a Glass Tiara. Make sure Cloud gets 
    the Diamond Tiara or your efforts here will be wasted. Now go to the 
    western part of the Wall Market and talk to the guy who's just walking 
    around pondering. Just speak with that guy and he'll give you the 
    Member's Card. Go inside and pick any room. Your welcomed to look through 
    the key hole on the occupied rooms if you like. When your all done head 
    out and return to the Dress Shop. When you and Aeris try everything out 
    go to Corneo's mansion. When you enter the mansion go to the basement on 
    the left side with the door open. Here you'll see Tifa downstairs and 
    eventually the guard will yell down the stairs, now head back upstairs 
    and go to the room in the middle of the second floor. When your let 
    inside you'll see Tifa and all three of you will be put in his office for 
    his choosing. Ha! Just look at Cloud always putting his head down! If 
    Cloud has any other combination of Silk Dres, Blonde Wig, Sexy Cologne, 
    Diamond Tiara, and Undergarnment Corneo will probably pick Tifa or Aeris. 
    When Cloud is chosen by Corneo you can decided to play along with his 
    come-ons or choose to reveal your true self, either way Tifa and Aeris 
    eventually break in. If Cloud was not Chosen he'll enter this room with a 
    bunch of men chasing after him. Don't worry they can't harm you and 
    they'll always follow you. When your in the room don't forget to pick the 
    PHOENIX DOWN on the right side of he room. Talk to Scotch in the top of 
    the room to reveal your true idenity.

BOSS: Corneo's Lackey HP: 42(each)
    This fight is incredibly easy just have Cloud pummel the lackies with his 
    regular attack's and you'll be fine.

    Next you'll fight Scotch who is superiorly strong compared to the 
    Lackey's but you are still way stronger.

BOSS: Scotch HP: 150 
    Just pummel this guy until he dies. If your HP runs low(boy you stink!) 
    just use a regular POTION because most likely he'll almost be gone and 
    just finish this guy off. One of Cloud's Limit Break should easily snap 
    this guy like a twig.

    Afterwards go into the hall and if Corneo chose Tifa go to the basement 
    and retrieve Aeris, if Tifa joins you in the hall go directly to Corneo's 
    office and into his backroom to meet either Tifa or Aeris. What's this? 
    Shinra plans to destroy the support structure over Sector 7 and that 
    would possibly crumble AVALANCHEs forces! When you realize that Don was 
    just hired by Shinra and to locate AVALANCHE's hideout your dropped to 
    the floor below. Don't forget to check Don Corneo's bed for a hidden 
    HYPER. Yes you heard right.


UNDERGROUND
    When you reach the underground make sure Aeris is equipped with the FIRE 
    MATERIA before heading on. Don't forget to put her in the back. Basically 
    give Aeris the RESTORE MATERIA linked with the ALL MATERIA in case you 
    become serverely injured.

BOSS: APS HP: 1200
    Well have Aeris use her Fire Attacks constantly against APS and heal the 
    party when your HP is below 180. You'll notice that APS has a SEWER 
    TSUNAMI attack that injures the party and him. If it comes from the front 
    of your party it'll do about 40-45 HP of damage to each character and 
    half that to any back row characters. If the SEWER TSUNAMI attack comes 
    from behind your party it'll do about 100-200 HP of damage to any back 
    row character and half that to any front row character. It's basically 
    random and most likely APS will be doing more damage to himself than you 
    can do to it. Have Cloud use his Cross-Slash Limit Break to paralize APS 
    or use Aeris' Seal Evil. No items for this battle.

    Don't forget to pick up the POTION near your entrance and continue to 
    walk along the sidewalk in the sewers and pick up the STEAL MATERIA along 
    the way to the ladder. When you get to the next area it's pretty linear. 
    Okay this next part is a little difficult and confusing but there are 
    lots of items down here. Also if you see any oil drums just search 
    through them and you might find some useful items. You can either crawl 
    over the trains or walk through theminside the trains. When you first 
    enter this area go over the train and pick up the HI-POTION. When you 
    reach the end of the train check the oil drum to the left to recieve 
    another HI-POTION. Then go up north and on the train and pick up the 
    POTION. Afterwards get back down and go northwest to pick up an ECHO 
    SCREEN. Now go northeast and pick up the POTION and continue on foward to 
    the next area. I know this place is dificult and sorry if I can't be more 
    descriptive. If your still stuck just email me and I'll lead you through    
    myself. Just be careful when you encounter Ghosts. They'll disappear 
    after being hit and reappear a little later so just hit the other 
    available targets and wait for the ghost to reappear. And don't forget to 
    steal a STRIKING STAFF from Eligor. He sorta looks like a half human half 
    chariot. This has staff has the same qualities of Aeris' current staff 
    but double the attack power. When you enter the next area make sure to go 
    right and pick up some supplies from an old man and go a little more 
    right to pick up an ETHER. Now go back to where you came in an go 
    directly north and hop onto the train which causes one of the boxcars to 
    move. Now go up to the second train but before you do go right to recieve 
    a HI-POTION. Now enter the former inacessible train directly above the 
    one you moved and this will create a bridge or walkway to Sector 7 Slums. 
    Before you hit the Slums you might want to consider fighting a few more 
    battles and gain a level or two before heading on. When your about to 
    leave the Trainyard deequip Aeris with any materia she may have and move 
    onto Sector 7 and a save point should be right ahead. Save your game now 
    before heading out. You'll notice as you are about to leave Aeris will 
    say that she will comfort Marlene and will temporarily leave your group. 
    When your done go up north of the save point and into the gate. 


SAVE SECTOR 7 SLUMS!!!
    Continue to climb the tower and don't forget to talk to Barret and you'll   
    have a chance to equip Barret with any materia Aeris used or any new 
    armor you may have purchased. Put Barret in the back row and head out. 
    When all done and done Reno will appear and he has just set off the bomb 
    to destroy the support pillar over Sector 7 Slums. You might still have a 
    chance to deactivate it but it's not gonna be easy.

BOSS: Reno HP: 2000
    This fight is not going to be easy. Have Barret or any one of your magic 
    users use any magic spells like FIRE, ICE, or LIGHTNING on Reno. You 
    can't do much about the Electro-mag Rod attack because it'll do a hefty 
    amount of damage and it'll stun one of your allies. Just heal him or her 
    if their HP falls below 200. Watch out for the Pyramid attack that will 
    encase one of your characters and prevent them from pariticpating in a 
    battle. Just have one of your characters target the pyramid and they 
    should be free. Don't forget to use any limit break that comes available. 
    After a tough fight Reno will take a look at the time and move out.

    Here you'll see Tseng of the Turks holding Aeris captive as he boast off 
    in his helicopter. The team tries to stop the bomb with their best 
    efforts but luck runs short on them, but they at least manage an escape.


SHINRA's GOING TO PAY!
    After the explosion Barret is furious and Cloud is mysteriously 
    interested in the Ancients and a wierd voice appears in his head while 
    resting upon a wrecked playground. Before you leave out make sure to pick 
    up the SENSE MATERIA around the little mouse house just below the slide. 
    When all done and done go to Aeris house to check on Barret's daughter 
    Marlene. On your way to Aeris' house don't forget to speak with the boy 
    who had five gil saved up and talk to him and you'll recieve a TURBO 
    ETHER. When you reach inside Aeris' house you'll get a lengthy 
    conversation with Elmyra about Aeris' and the Ancients. Afterwards rest 
    upstairs and don't forget to save outside of Aeris' house. Now go to the 
    northern part of the Wall Market and follow the little kids running 
    around and you'll see the entrance to Shinra Tower. You'll see Barret's 
    descrption of the "Golden Shiny wire of hope" but there's not much you 
    can do now except go to the weapons shop. You know the shop labeled with 
    a pink sign that says "GUN." Purchase the batteries the weapon shop owner 
    is selling for three hundred gil. You must purchase them to advance 
    through the game! Now head back to the "Golden shiny wire of hope" boy I 
    love saying that! When you reach the top after a long climb you'll see a 
    yellow socket to the right. Move up the tangled rails and to the right 
    yellow sewer tube and place the batteries in the socket. You'll see the 
    propeller moving but it seems the weapon shop owner sold you some cheap 
    batteries. Doesn't matter your priority is to get to Shinra's corporate 
    tower. Now the propeller has made a bridge cross the bridge and onto the 
    next junkyard and place the battery into barricade. Now you'll notice a 
    pole swinging around. This part is quite fustrating and it took me twenty 
    minutes to get through this. Basically you just have to aim so you land 
    on the swing pole. Don't worry if you miss you'll just be droppe to the 
    platform below and open to try again. When you reach it make sure to go 
    right and place a battery into the socket to open up a dirty treasure 
    chest to reveal an ETHER. Now head right and onto the big tube that leads 
    to the Shinra Tower.


SHINRA CORPORATE TOWER
    Save your game here. Afterwards your given the option of going to the 
    front or taking the stairs. They both lead to the same place so you 
    decide. If you go through the stairs there are no enemies but it'll take 
    you about fifteen minutes to get past them cause they are extremely long. 
    If you take the stairs explore each set of stairs and check the fifth 
    staircase to pick up an ELIXIR. If you take the front a bunch of people 
    will run out of the building except for some Grenade Combatants. Taking 
    this area is alot shorter than the stairs and you recieve Gil, 
    Expierience, and Ability Points. In this area your forced to fight random 
    encounters, but the battles aren't too difficult. On the second tier you 
    can buy some supplies and watch a video of Shinra Motors before moving 
    on. Now go to the elevators in the back and move to the 59th Floor. In 
    the elevator an alarm sounds and you are forced to fight a number of 
    battles that the team easily wins. When you reach the 59th floor go to 
    the yellow staircase and fight the guards to recieve the KEYCARD 60. This 
    will allow you access to the see-through elevator and will let you go 
    back down to the lobby where you can save and rest. When you reach this 
    floor you'll see four guards the block your path. You can only get 
    through if you move behind the statues when the guards turn to walk. You 
    must also call your fiends over(Tifa and Barret) and signal them to move 
    to each statue when the cost is clear. If you mess up and get caught by 
    the guards you are forced to fight two guards and you must start over 
    from the beginning. Well when I was here I kept fighting the guards until 
    there were no more left and I easily went to the next staircase. It might 
    be different for some people because you have to fight alot of battles. 
    When you reach the 61th floor south of the staircase. He will tell you 
    about Aeris and give you the KEYCARD 62. When you reach the 62nd floor go 
    all the way to the left of the floor and talk to Mayr Domino. He'll give 
    you a challenge to figure out a password. You can visit Hart just outside 
    the office and buy tips from him, but they get steeper everytime. If you 
    can get the password in the first try you get the ELEMENTAL MATERIA. But 
    you can go to the library in the middle of the floor to figure out the 
    clues. There are four different libraries on this floor each of them 
    contains a letter to the password. When you enter each library read the 
    plaque outside to see which library it is. Now check the number on each 
    file. Some numbers don't belong in that particular library. If the file 
    starts with a number 6 check the 6th letter in the file. If you see this 
    file "Modern history of Midgar Space program vol. 1" then just go back to 
    Mayor Domino and pick MAKO as your password because the 16th letter of 
    the file name is the letter M. When that's done the Mayor will give you 
    the KEYCARD 63, KEYCARD 64, and KEYCARD 65. You can save yourself a ton 
    of time if you just try to figure out the password on your own by 
    guessing the password. If you so happen to miss the passowrd on the first 
    try you do not get the ELEMENTAL MATERIA but this materia isn't really 
    important nor would it help much in your upcoming battles. When you reach 
    the 63rd floor you are given the option of getting the Item Coupons or 
    just move on to the next area. If you want to get the items follow these 
    steps:
      First visit the computer on the bottom right handed side of the floor 
      and talk to the computer and you'll get a chance to open three security 
      doors. When you first talk to the computer and recieving the chance to 
      open the three security doors first go ALL the way up to the north part 
      of the floor and open the first door from the right and open the third 
      door from the RIGHT and go to the room in the left to get the coupon 
      and return to the computer for your prize which includes a STAR 
      PENDANT, FOUR SLOT, and ALL MATERIA. Now go back to the same procedure 
      as above and when you enter the room go through the duct and you'll 
      enter at the room in the middle and open the box to recieve the ITEM 
      COUPON, now go out of that room, but not the duct and open the next 
      door on your LEFT and enter the room to recieve the last ITEM COUPON. 
      Now return to the computer to recive your items and head for the 64th 
      floor.
    When you reach the 64th floor go all the way to the left side of the 
    floor where you can rest and save. It's wise to save here so just go 
    ahead and save it. Now head for the lockers in the north part of the 
    floor and check the lockers to recieve the MEGAPHONE. This item is 
    useless now but you'll probably need it later as a weapon. After wards go 
    on to the 65th floor. Here on this floor you are forced to fight serveral 
    pretty easy battles. Now go all the way to the west side of the floor and 
    enter the top room and all the way to the left of the room is your first 
    Midgar part in which you place at the center of the floor, place the part 
    in a counter clockwise pattern. Now go back to the west side of the floor 
    but enter the bottom room and collect the Midgar part on the left side of 
    the room and place it in the next slot in the Midgar model. Now go back 
    to the west side of the floor and enter the top room and get the Midgar 
    part up on the north part of the room. Now place it on the Midgar model. 
    Now go back to the west side of the room and enter the bottom room and 
    get the Midgar part and place it in the Midgar Model. Now go to the room 
    northeast of the floor and collect the last Midgar part and place it in 
    the center of the room. Afterwards you'll here the same sound that opens 
    the boxes as you heard earlier. Now go to the staircase and pick up the 
    KEYCARD 66 that you couldn't pick up when you came in this floor and head 
    for the 66th floor. When you arrive here head for the bathroom in the 
    northwest corner of the floor and climb up the toilet and into the ducts 
    to overhere the meeting in the office. Now head back out and go back to 
    the stairs to the 67th floor. Upon arriving on the 67th floor you'll see 
    a guy in a white gown now follow him to the southwest corner of the floor 
    and into the storage room and collect 4 POTIONs. When you encounter a 
    Soldier:3rd make sure to steal the Hardedge from them. This is Cloud's 
    best weapon of choice as of now. Also fight some Moth Slashers you know 
    the machines with spinning spikes at the bottom and steal a couple of 
    Carbon Bangles from them. This is the strongest type of armor in the game   
    as of now. If you recieved the FOUR SLOTS earlier you might only want to 
    steal two CARBON BANGLES because the FOUR SLOT has 4 linked materia slots 
    so you can give it to Barret and put him in the back and make him your 
    basic materia user or healer. When your in the storage room check the 
    giant tank that reads Jenova and Cloud realizes that Sephiroth is near 
    by. Before you go to the 68th floor equip the POISON MATERIA, which can 
    be found in the center of the floor on either one of your party member's 
    armor with the ELEMENTAL MATERIA in the same slot. And if you have a STAR 
    PENDANT equip that with someone else so you'll be protected from poison. 
    When you arrive you'll see Aeris in a specimen tank along with a strange 
    red dog. When you free them both the mystreious dog offers his help so 
    send Tifa with Aeris and let Barret remain in your party. Now Hojo will 
    send his latest creation.

BOSS: SAMPLE: HO512 & SAMPLE: HO512-OPT HP:1800 SAMPLE: HO512-OPT HP: 200 Item: Tailsman
    This boss is pretty tough, but nothing the team can't handle. Don't worry 
    about SAMPLE: HO512-OPT(the little eye guys) because they'll keep coming 
    back to life. This boss will sometimes poision your party member if 
    he/she is protected by the ELEMENTAL-POISION MATERIA combination then 
    he/she should be fine. This goes the same if someone else is equipped 
    with a Star Pendant. If someone is poisoned you an ANTIDOTE to get rid of 
    it. Always attack the guy in the middle(SAMPLE: HO512) and never hit 
    anybody or anything else. If he goes they go.

    Afterwards collect the ENEMY SKILL MATERIA from the giant lab tank and 
    just keep talking to Hojo's lab assistant and he'll give you the KEYCARD 
    68. Now go back to the 66th floor and head for the elevators. Before you 
    can go anywhere Tseng and Rude cut you off.


IMPRISIONED
    President Shinra explains his interest over the Cetra or Ancients. What 
    he's really after is Mako energy and Aeris is the key to the Promised 
    Land. After the long talk you'll be taken captive in holding cells on the 
    67th floor. When Cloud is in the holding cell speak with the other party 
    members and take a nap. When Cloud awakes he'll notice that the security 
    doors have been unlocked. Go outside the door and talk to the injured 
    guard and go back to your holding cel and talk to Tifa. After you aquire 
    the cell key from the injured guard free the others and follow the trail 
    of blood that leads to the president's office. You'll see that President 
    Shinra is dead and with the look of the sword on his back it looks like 
    the Masamune! Only Sephiroth could handle the destructive power of this 
    sword. Cloud now will take the opportunity to meet the new president of 
    Shin-Ra, Rufus who has his helicopter lying on top of the building. Now 
    when Tifa is gone to stay behind and wait for Cloud give Aeris the 
    LIGHTNING MATERIA and any other materia. Now give Red XIII the ICE 
    MATERIA before you head on. Don't forget to put al characters in the back 
    row. Now when your done head for the elevators and they encounter another 
    high tech machine by Shinra.

BOSS: Hundred Gunner HP: 1600 
    If someone does not have a long range weapon or equipped with some spell 
    materia then your in deep trouble. But you'll want to keep you party 
    members in the back so they sustain less damage. Have Aeris constantly 
    use BOLT because it'll do alot of damage and have Red XIII use ICE while 
    Barret use his regular attacks. When your Limit Breaks are up use them. 
    When you get it down to about 300 HP he'll prepare for its super weapon 
    the Sensor Cannon. It'll take it two rounds for it to actually fire the 
    cannon, but that should be enough to finish him off.

    When he's through he'll transform into the Heli Gunner

BOSS: Heli Gunner HP: 1000 Item: Mythril Armlet
    This boss is similar to the first except when it nears about 250 HP it'll 
    boost up its attacks and sometimes cause some negative status effects on 
    the party. That's why its a good time to equip yourself with the STAR 
    PENDANT or the POISON-ELEMENTAL MATERIA combination. POISON however will 
    not work against either of these two bosses nor any other negative status 
    effects that you can put on them because their machines. Basically this 
    is the same fight as the first and keep your HP above 200.

    After the tough boss fight Cloud has his boss to deal with. Appaerently 
    Rufus is also after the promised land and just when Cloud and Rufus were 
    becoming best friends. Your given the chance to equip cloud, but if you 
    have a spare RESTORE MATERIA equip it with Cloud. 

BOSS: Rufus HP: 500 Dark Nation HP: 200 Items: Power Vest and Power Source
    This fight will be tough because Dark Nation will provide all the 
    potection on himslef and Rufus so kill Dark Nation first and concentrate 
    on Rufus. If your in the back row with Cloud have him change and put him 
    in the front row because with Rufus' barrier and your weakened back row 
    attacks you'll have a long fight against this guy. Just keep pounding on 
    Rufus and use your Limit Breaks when available.

    Afterwards leave and find Tifa but don't forget to save behind the desk. 
    Now set all back row members in the front and front row members in the 
    back for the fight later. Tifa will rush down the stairs and tell the 
    rest of the party to follow her and she'll fill them in on the way. So 
    what's Cloud doing? He's borrowing one of the new high tech Shin-Ra 
    motorcycles while the rest of the party ride on the new Shin-Ra truck. 
    Here you'll enter a mini-game and you'll see the Lifebar above and below 
    Cloud. They are there for two reasons:
      1.If any party member or Cloud loses the green part of the bar you must 
        start over.
      2.The damage incurred will be carried on to the next battle.
    Basically stay near the truck and swat away the motorcycles coming 
    towards you. Never stay far off from your truck because other bikers will 
    follow in and hit the truck causing damage to your party members. Try 
    using the Domino Effect by knocking down a biker in front of another 
    biker so that they both fall down and slide across the pavement. This 
    mini-game is fairly long but still is alot of fun. When you reach the end 
    of the road get ready for yet your fifth boss fight.

BOSS: Motor Ball HP: 2600 Item: Star Pendant
    Remember when you were to switch your party members in reverse order? 
    Well for this boss you'll see why. This boss will be one tough fight. He 
    gets the first attack on your party causing 80-95 HP of damage to every 
    character. Have Aeris use BOLT because as of to this point she has the 
    most magic power you can cause almost 300 HP of damage with her. But the 
    problem is is that you can't choose the three of five thats gonna fight. 
    The only person you know will fight is Cloud. The other two members in 
    your party are random. But if she is in your party for the fight have 
    Aeris' use BOLT. Have Cloud attack regularly in the front row and have 
    Barret attack from the back row since he has a long range weapon. When 
    the Motor Ball starts to stand up its preparing for its Rolling Fire 
    attack that can inflict up to 280 HP of damage to all characters so watch 
    out! Use limit breaks when neccessary. Its good that you have Cloud with 
    the RESTORE-ALL MATERIA combination so he can heal the party after the 
    Rolling Fire attack. If you see him standing up make sure all party 
    members' HP are above 300. And try to do so throughout the fight.

    When the battle is over with you(yes you the player not Cloud) are about 
    to explore some real interesting areas you never saw in the dark and 
    gloomy Midgar. This is the point where everything starts to unfold with 
    the WHITE and BLACK MATERIA and you'll know who Zack is soon enough. Is 
    Cloud really Cloud? Is he a fake? Well I'm not going to spoil it for you 
    here. Until the time comes I'll spill my guts. Sephiroth obviously headed 
    for Kalm and Cloud knows he's out there. What does Jenova have in 
    connection with Sephiroth? Well take once good long kiss goodbye to 
    Midgar because it'll be some time before you'll need to come back here.


SEPHIROTH and CLOUD FIGHTING TOGETHER?
    When you walk out of Midgar go northeast into a Kalm. You might want to 
    save it when you first leave Midgar because some enemies can get pretty 
    nasty out here. Well once you get inside you can search around if you 
    like and if you do first go into the first three houses on the left side 
    of Kalm. When you go inside the first two houses pick up an ETHER from 
    each house. Now go to the next house and pick up the PEACEMAKER, no this 
    weapon is not for Barret, its for somebody else. In the next area pick up 
    the GUARD SOURCE. Now go to the Kalm Traveler's house in the southeast 
    part of town and pick up an ETHER inside. You can visit the shops but 
    don't buy any weapons for Cloud since the weapons here don't match the 
    HARDEDGE. Buy some armor if you like but its best to save your money. You 
    can go to the Materia shop and pick up some new Materia. Only two new 
    materia should you keep your eyes focused on and they are the EARTH 
    MATERIA and HEAL MATERIA. Once your done exploring go to the Inn, your 
    friends are waiting upstairs and the night is free. It doesn't really 
    matter if you go to the Inn first or looked around town first because 
    Barret will still be pissed off at you being so late. This is where I 
    spoil things for you so if you don't want to find out what happens don't 
    read on. When Cloud begins you see him in a truck walking around and 
    being so excited that he's in SOLDIER. When the truck stops another 
    creature created by Mako confronts both Sephiroth and Cloud, Cloud barely 
    tickles the green dragon, but Sephiroth kills it with once swift of his 
    Masamune Blade. Sephiroth level is at 50 and your at level one so you can 
    actually picture how strong this guy is. Once your in Mt.Nibel the 
    monsters create by Mako don't get any easier, but Sephiroth breaks them 
    with an Ice3 spell, while Cloud just stands there as a punching bag. Well 
    at Nibelheim Cloud gets a chance to visit all the people in the town as 
    well as Tifa's house. Go to Tifa's house(the house next to Cloud's on the 
    bottom left corner) and play the piano upstairs and write this down:

Do-Re-Mi-Ti-La
Do-Re-Mi-So-Fa-Do-Re-Do

    Now put it somewhere so you won't lose it. You'll need this for the Final 
    Heaven later on. When your done with the piano and talked to Cloud's 
    mother about him needing a quiet girlfriend go back to where Sephiroth 
    entered. Afterwards you are taken outside and a photographer wants your 
    picture. Sephiroth hesitates a little but goes forth with it. He mentions 
    about giving each one of you a copy of the picture. When you reach 
    Mt.Nibel you stumble upon the bridge and lead Cloud through the 
    mountains. When Sephiroth arives at the Mako reactor chamber he goes 
    berserk with his sword slashing at the test tanks, then it hits him. Is 
    this what I'm truely am? "I knew I was special but not like this" when 
    you have Cloud look in the giant test tank you'll see a once human life 
    form transformed into a hideous and bizzare creature. At this point Cloud 
    freaks out and slumps to the floor. When Sephiroth is gone go back to 
    Nibelheim and go to the mansion in the middle of town. First take the 
    stairs and enter on the right and go down the long tube. Here you'll find 
    a library with Sephiroth in it. It appears he wants to learn about Hojo's 
    Mako expieriments. Sephiroth will spend all night reading the books so 
    have Cloud move to the other room on the second floor and have him rest. 
    When he wakes up the guard is gone and the library has books all over the 
    floor. Go outside the mansion and the town is ablazed! What happen here? 
    It appears that Sephiroth is ashamed of his origin and he goes on a 
    killing spree burning the town and killing the people in it, including 
    Cloud and Tifa's parents. Here you'll see some cool scenes that should 
    look extremely familiar if you have seen the T.V. ads and magazine ads. 
    When Cloud arrives at Mt.Nibel he finds that Tifa wants revenge for what 
    happened to her parents and tries to kill Sephiroth but wasn't very 
    successful. Then Cloud comes and go talk to Tifa and put her to the side. 
    When Cloud goes in the Reacor core Sephiroth is looking over the 2000 
    year old geological stratum called Jenova. It appears that this creature 
    of some sort is Sephiroth's mother. Here you'll go through another scene 
    with graphics that should look very familar. Here Cloud wants all the 
    answers about what Sephiroth has done. Tifa was nearly killed as both 
    Cloud and Tifa appraoched Sephiroth. Afterwards Cloud can't remember what 
    happened after the tragic moment. Now when your story is told go 
    downstairs and talk to Barret to recieve the PHS which is like a phone 
    and you can call and rearrange your party members on a save point or on 
    the world map. This will come useful later on. Afterwards you can fight 
    the Custom sweepers just ouside of Kalm and steal Atomic Scissors, which 
    is Barret's strongest weapon up to this point of the game. If you haven't 
    explored Kalm earlier go ahead and do so now and you might want to 
    restock on your supplies. If your low on money fight the enemies around 
    town and save when your weak. Now its onward for the search for 
    Sephiroth.


SEARCH FOR SEPHIROTH
    When your out of Kalm head east until you see a ranch. This walk wil be 
    fairly long and the enemies might give you some trouble, so take the 
    neccessary supplies and head forth. When you reach this area go inside 
    and into the Chocobo Ranch. First off talk to the closest chocobo near 
    you and say "Wark" after the chocobos dance you'll recieve your first 
    SUMMON MATERIA of the game. It's also the weakest but at this point of 
    the game its alot stronger than what you can dish out! When you go inside 
    the ranch speak with Chocobo Billy and he'll tell you that you need a 
    chocobo to cross the marsh. But he doesn't have a chocobo for you, but 
    you can lure them out with the CHOCOBO LURE MATERIA he has for 2000 Gil. 
    At this point this will most likely be all that you can afford and you'll 
    also need to buy a green to keep the chocobo from running away. Buy a 
    TANTAL green and head out afterwards. Now walk olong the chocobo tracks 
    along the area of the Ranch, you know those "V" shaped marks on the 
    grassy terrain. When you hear sort of a cowboy music that is completely 
    different form regular battles you know that you have a chocobo. When 
    your in battle immediately give the chocobo a green. You might want to 
    move the green to the top so you won't waste time searching for it. When 
    the chocobo is given a green quickly finish off the other enemies and 
    don't hit the chocobo or else you'll have wasted your money you spent for 
    the green and forced to try again. Don't wait to long to give the chocobo 
    the green either because the opponent will attack your party members and 
    the chocobo hates violence and will run off. If you do cause alot of 
    damage to a chocobo he'll attack everybody and run off. After you have 
    captured a chocobo don't hit the X button until you have safely reached 
    the Mythril Mine down south of the chocobo ranch. When you reach the 
    swamp or marsh stay away from the serpant's shadow or you'll be force to 
    fight the Midgar Zolom here are it's stats:

HP: 4000 MP: 348 EXP: 250 Gil: 400 AP: 25 Susceptable to GRAVITY

    As you can see this guy doesn't give much and he will finish off your 
    party in a snap of a finger. While your on your chocobo you won't 
    encounter any enemies except for this one. You won't be strong enough to 
    kill it in a long while. Just stay away from it. When you reach the 
    entrance to the Mythril Mine you'll see a Midgar Zolom slaughtered on a 
    tree. Sephiroth knows your coming and that's his warning sign. Now do you 
    get the idea of how strong he is?
NOTE: You really don't need a chocobo for this part, but your chances 
      escaping from the Midgar Zolom will be down, but that doesn't mean you 
      still don't have a good chance at dodging it. The serpent is about 40% 
      faster than you are, but if you have quick reflexes go ahead and dodge 
      it, but save before entering the marsh. When you reach inside the 
      Mythril Mine go to the right and when you see a vine hanging out climb 
      it and you'll reach the top of a tier go to the treasure bx to collect 
      the LONG RANGE MATERIA, this materia will allow you to put any party 
      member in the back and cause the same amount of damage as if they were 
      in the front without taking alot of damage. Now climb back down and 
      climb the rock stairs on the right and pick up an ETHER on the stairs 
      and go to the treasure chest to pick up a TENT. When your all through 
      go back out to the entrance and from the netrance go south down the 
      cave until you see a treasure chest go to it and open it up to reveal a 
      MIND SOURCE. Now go to the left and in the next sceen you'll encounter 
      Tseng and Rude of the Turks along with the newest member Elena. She'll 
      screw up and talk about Sephiroth heading for Junon Harbor. You should 
      see the words highlighted to tel you exactly where you need to go. Whne 
      your coversation with the Turks is over head north of the cave and into 
      another area, here you'll see a green light the background that's the 
      Mako energy. Pick up the ELIXIR just in front of you and the HI-POTION 
      in the back. Now head out of the Mythril Mine and onward to Junon 
      Harbor. 


FORT CONDOR and the STRATEGY GAME
    You'll notice a trophy like icon on the world map go inside and take a 
    look around. At this point of the game this place is completely optional. 
    You are welcomed to visit this place and participate in the strategy 
    battle by speaking to the man at the top of Fort Condor. You can help pay 
    for troops if you like, but you may want to rest and save at the bottom 
    of the Fort. When your all done leave and head for the grassy area near 
    Junon Harbor. You can't buy any items if you don't participate in the 
    battle. The Materia and items sold here are nothing to worry about 
    because you already have what they're selling.


MYSTERY NINJA LEVEL: 32
    Northwest of Fort Condo you should find a forest with a mystery ninja 
    around. This part is a real spoiler and completely optional and has 
    nothing to do with beating the game. 

BOSS: Mystery Ninja Level: 32 HP: (Basically depends on what level your at the higher your level the more HP she has. 
    Just hit her with your normal attacks and you should be fine. She 
    shouldn't be much of a problem.

    Afterwards talk to to the downed ninja and do not save. She'll ask you to 
    fight one more time, just say your "Not interested." She begins to taunt 
    you and will ask if you are scared of her you reply by "Petrified." 
    Afterwards she turns her back and starts to leave and you tell her to 
    "Wait a Second." She's listening and she asked if you want her along you 
    reply: "...That's right." She agrees and you say "...Let's hurry on." 
    Don't ak her for her name because she'll just leave. Now go northwest and 
    look for a giant cannon sticking out of a military base on the side of a 
    montain near the waters.


JUNON HARBOR and PRISCILLA
    Before you go to the shores give Cloud the LONG RANGE MATERIA and switch 
    him to the back row. Now have Barret equipped with his ASSULT GUN. Now 
    give your thrid party member any other materia and put him or her in the 
    backrow. Make sure the third member has a ALL-RESTORE MATERIA 
    combination. Now when you enter this dark town you might want to rest 
    outside of Junon Harbor using a TENT. Now save your game and head for the 
    shores just south Junon inside the town. Along the shores you'll see a 
    girl named Priscilla playing with a dolphin and she asks you to leave 
    immdiately because she thinks your with the Shin-Ra. When you are about 
    to leave Priscilla gets attacked by a sea serpent.

BOSS:Bottomswell HP: 2000 Item: Power Wrist
    Just have your long ranged characters attack regularly and have your 
    third party member use FIRE or ICE or LIGHTNING on Bottomswell and have 
    that same party member heal your party when your HP drops below 200. This 
    isn't any easy fight, because one of your characters will sometimes be 
    encased in a giant water bubble and can no longer participate in the 
    battle except:

      1. You pop the bubble with magic not physical attacks
      2. Or you can wait till they sufocate and then bring them back to life  
         with a PHEONIX DOWN

    When one of your party members are encased they slowly lose their HP so 
    make sure to take neccessary precuations. When you kill Bottomswell it'll 
    use the Big Wave. Just make sure to keep your HP above 200 and you should 
    be fine.

    It seems that Priscilla isn't breathing! You must perform CPR on her or 
    she'll die. When Cloud's lungs fill up hit the O button to release the 
    air back in. Don't over inhale because Cloud will exhale. Don't worry she 
    can't die because she's not suppose to. When she starts to breathe she'll 
    need to rest. Now go to the lady in front of Junon and take her up on he 
    offer and spend the night at her house. When your done Cloud starts 
    hearing voices and asks Tifa about Nibelheim. When your through go speak 
    with Priscilla and she'll give you the SHIVA MATERIA your second SUMMON 
    MATERIA of the game. Now you need a way to the top of Junon but how? 
    Priscilla got it! You can hop on her dolphin friend and reach the top. 
    First find the spot to want to jump from and call Mr.Dholphin. This is a 
    little easier than the swinging pole at the Wall Market but still pretty 
    fustrating. Just keep trying until you make it.


JUNON BASE
    When your here keep going left until you see a little yellow box. go to 
    that box and switch it to make the lift go down. You'll here some pretty 
    energetic music here and for a reason. The new Shin-Ra president is 
    arriving, Rufus. When you reach to the door at the end your wlecomed to 
    save it but not now. Go to the northern room when you enter and you'll 
    come in the locker room. The captain will just think your out of uniform 
    and he'll lend you another one. In here you are to perform the 
    traditional Shin-Ra greeting. Just follow what the soldiers do and you do 
    the same. You are chosen to give the final greeting which is Cloud's 
    winning pose and the troops will be amazed! When all is done and done 
    follow the commander through a shortcut to the parade. Here gets quite 
    difficult because Cloud must get to the back row without messing things 
    up. You'll see a rating chart at the botom of the screen that basically 
    tells you waht kind of item you get. The higher the rating the better the 
    item(s). 

29% or lower     Grenade
30%-39%          POTION(6)
40%-49%          ETHER(6)
50% or higher    5000 Gil

    After you make it through the new Shin-Ra president will be very pleased 
    and you also know that Sephiroth is here, but you can't do anything now. 
    Your captain will give you a little practice before performing the proper 
    greeting. Take your time to practice and head out. Make sure you visit 
    all the shops in Junon because there are alot of freebies. Make sure you 
    pick up:

1/35 SOLDIER(2)
SPEED SOURCE
POWER SOURCE
LUCK SOURCE
GUARD SOURCE
MIND SOURCE
ENEMY SKILL MATERIA.

    Here you'll find some pretty good shops and you have two materia to look 
    out for, SEAL MATERIA and REVIVE. You can buy some new armor and 
    accessories cause you'll need them. The items in Junon are quite steep 
    but if you perform well you can save yourself the Gil. When your all done 
    go to the dock and you are now tested to perform your greeting. If the 
    president's mood is high your item will be high in value as well. Look at 
    the chart below.

0-50   Sunglasses
51-99  HP PLUS MATERIA
100+   FORCE STEALER(Cloud's strongest sword as of now)

    When your all done go into the boat.


ALL ABOARD!
    When you reach aboard talk to the people wandering around, hey wait a 
    minute! How your other party members get onboard? Well anyways just don't 
    forget the items like the ETHER on the left side of the bottom floor of 
    the boat and the ALL MATERIA just across from the ETHER to the right 
    side. Now there's a save point on the deck of the boat save it cause its 
    a must. Now go to the fron of the boat and talk to Barret serveral times 
    and an alarm sounds off, what! Did one of your party members get caught? 
    Wait their talking about a man in a black cape, that's Sephiroth! 
    Sephiroth is onboard! Now go down and head for the room the guard was 
    previoulsy standing in front of and you'll engage in a storyline. Pick up 
    the Wind Slash just in front of the dead guard and head for Sephiroth but 
    wait, what's this?

BOSS: Jenova-Birth HP: 6000 Item: White Cape & Ifrit Materia
    Now this boss is obviously not an easy fight, but don't worry the other 
    fights with Jenova get easier. First off continue to cast all your 
    summons and when you run out use the FIRE MATERIA to cause some good 
    damage. Watch out when she cast STOP on one of your characters which will 
    paralyze your characters temporarily. Watch out when she uses her Tail 
    Laser which can cause up 400 HP of DMG. Just keep your HP up around 300 
    and move quickly and get organized before the battle. 

    After a long fight your fast approaching Costa Del Sol.


BEACH TOWN
    When you reach here its nice, warm, and pleasant. Too bad! Because you 
    still have a lot of work to do. When you first approach this town go take 
    the stairs next to the entrance and enter the side of the house that says 
    "Costa Del Sol." Inside you can buy the house for 300,000 Gil, yeah its 
    cheap, but you might wanna rather take the items in the basement. Down 
    the basement you'll find a FIRE RING, POWER SOURCE, and a MOTOR DRIVE 
    which is Tifa's strongest weapon up to this point. Go ahead and visit the 
    shops and kick the ball a few times and head out. Now head west to 
    Mt.Corel. And buy those softs! 


HIKING TIME!
    When you reach Mt. Corel you'll find plenty of items worth taking.  When 
    you reach the reactor there's just nothing to do inside for now head down 
    towards the railroad tracks. Occasionally you fall but as long as you 
    hold right or left and quickly tap the O button as your falling you 
    should pick up a Star Pendant and a Wizard Staff. Now when you reach the 
    tracks the look like they cross each other take the top bridge and pick 
    up a W MACHINE GUN for Barret, TURBO ETHER, and a TRANSFORM MATERIA. Now 
    take the high path and go all the way to the end and hit the control 
    switch for the bridge. When you hear birds chriping climb up the side of 
    the mountain and you'll see a bird's nest. Your welcomed to pick up the 
    10 PHEONIX DOWNS but it disturbs the birds and your forced to fight it's 
    mother, Cokatolis. Don't worry she shouldn't be of any threat except that 
    the fact that she can cast STONE on one of your party members. Afterwards 
    go down to the lower tracks until you see two tracks that meet. Turn 
    right as you reach them and into a small mine to pick up a POWER SOURCE, 
    MIND SOURCE, and TENT. Now go back outside and continue down and past a 
    long bridge until you reach  North Corel.

    Here you'll find a dirty town also Barret's hometown. Now see what these 
    reactors are doing? Are you gonna let this happen? Of course not! Your 
    welcomed to visit the shops. Buy some weapons you didn't have before or 
    something strong for Barret. Now go to the left side of North Corel and 
    into Gold Saucer, a fun-filled arcade that's better than playing Marvel 
    vs Capcom! Okay its not that good, but the games sure are fun! When you 
    enter here don't use the save point because it'll cost you five Gold 
    Points not Gil, you can exchange your money for GP if you have enough 
    money and when the guy is standing in the back. Go to the entrance a pay 
    a mere 3000 Gil for the entrance or if you want, pay another mere 30,000 
    Gil for a lifetime pass. Now when you go in and enter the Speed Arena to 
    meet Dio the owner of Gold Saucer. Now head to Wonder Square to pick up 
    Cait Sith to add to your party and head for Battle Arena. With a guy's 
    arm replaced by a gun going berserk against Shinra soldiers, they more 
    than wilingly accused Barret of the mass murder. But can Barret let his 
    emotions about what happen to North Corel release them to an innocent 
    crowd like this? You are now prisoners of Corel for a crimed that was 
    framed upon your party and thrown to an unescapable prison. 


DESERT PRISON
    First off, just watch your items so equip all the materia to your armor 
    and equip as many people with the most valuable weapons and armors and 
    accesories your party may have cause there are Bandits around who will 
    steal all uneqipped items and materia and all other items worth stealing 
    like HI-Potion or ETHERs. You must defeat these bandits quick because 
    you'll lose your item permanately if you don't. Barret is in a depressed 
    state and he leaves but follow him off screen.Now when your in the next 
    screen go to the bottom left corner of the prison to find Barret. He 
    tells about his intervening with Scarlet and a terrible accident happened 
    when Barret and Dyne returned to North Corel, they both loss there arms 
    and were forced to replace them with gun-arms against Shin-Ra. Now go 
    back to the entrance of the prison and through the gate the man was on 
    previously and enter it and go to the right and up north to find Barret's 
    best friend Dyne. Ouch! This guy isn't too happy about Barret's return 
    and he wishes to destroy everything Barret loves most.

BOSS: DYNE HP: 1200 Item: Silver Armlet
    Well its best that Barret is equipped with the RESTORE MATERIA so he can 
    heal himself if it wasn't stolen by the bandits. Also give Barret a HYPER 
    in his regular status so he is on FURY which will double his Limit Break 
    meter's growth. But he might miss sometimes but it shouldn't be a 
    problem. Keep your HP above 350 because he can use his S-Mine attack 
    after his regular attack sometimes and will do a lot of damage. When he 
    has about 300 HP left he will use his Molotov Cocktail which will do 150-
    200 HP of damage so keep your HP up. This guy isn't easy so don't cry 
    when you lose, just try again.

    When Dyne is defeated he is serverely wounded and afterwards he will give 
    a pendant to give to Marlene. Then at the same time he kills himself. Now 
    go rest and visit Mr.Coates an S-Class chocobo racer and your only ticket 
    out of this dead prison. Now Mr.Coates won't be so willing to help 
    because he knows Dyne is dead and now if the party wants out they must 
    win a short course chocobo race. Don't forget to pick up the RUMAH SUMMON 
    MATERIA while your inside his office. When you race all you'll want to do 
    during the entire race is to get a head start by pushing the O button, 
    then stops when you have about 15% of your stamina left and hold R1+R2 
    together to build up your chocobo's stamina. You can basically have the 
    chocobo sprint the entire way having an easy victory by hitting the 
    SQUARE button. Now with apologies from Dio he offers his crappy worn out 
    Buggy which will help you get to your next destination. You the buggy and 
    go south pas the river to reach an area which looks like a model of an 
    old reactor which is Gongaga Village. 


ZACK's HOMETOWN
    Now when you enter continue on the same path and you'll encounter Rude, 
    Elena, and Reno of the Turks. Elena will run off to warn Tseng. You 
    should have Aeris use her Seal Evil or have someone use the CHOCO/MOG 
    SUMMON to paralyze both the Turks before engaging battle.

BOSS: Rude and Reno HP: Reno(2000) Rude(2000) Item: Fairy Tale and X-Potion
    If you use your CHOCO/MOG SUMMON or Aeris' Seal Evil you should be fine, 
    just keep using it until they are paralyzed and start pounding away with 
    your strongest summon and spells. 

    Now go to the center of the reactor and Scarlet and Tseng will show up 
    talking about an explosive new weapon and needs the HUGE MATERIA to do 
    so. Scarlet will talk about junky reactors having bad materia, but if you 
    pick up the glowing red materia you'll recieve the TITAN SUMMON MATERIA. 
    I don't consider this junky, do you? Now go back to the walkway you 
    entered and go back to where you fought the Turks and pick up the 
    DEATHBLOW COMMAND MATERIA just above where you fought. Now head right 
    until you see the screen start to turn red and go up until you see sorta 
    of a giant telescope on top of a canyon and the Buggy breaks down right 
    in front of it. 


BUGENHAGEN and NANAKI
    Here this place is very comfortable and tribal music is soothing to the 
    ears which Barret promised to bring his AVALANCHE members to if they 
    stopped Shin-Ra's mako reactors. Don't forget to talk to the contruction 
    worker and tell him you are not here to study and he'll fix the buggy for 
    you. When Red XIII meets BUGENHAGEN you'll notice that he is Red XIII's 
    father and that his real name is Nanaki. Here you'll learn about the 
    spirit energy and that when living things die their spirit energy is 
    returned to the earth. NOw go to the save spot you saw earlier and save 
    it. And enter the center of Cosmo Canyon and talk with everybody, you 
    know the place with the locked door. After you have talked to Red XIII 
    BUGENHAGEN will appear and unlock the door to the Cave of Gi.


CAVE OF GI
    Here just climb the ladders into the cave. When you first enter the cave 
    alot of empty spaces are along the walls each one of them contains a 
    breakable rock. Each time you break a rock a fight will initiate. There's 
    a secret door in the middle of the cave but I forgot what's in it. Well 
    that's all done go to the next room until you see red on the floor below 
    the rocks. First you might want to go out to the gave on the left and 
    collect the ADDED AFFECT MATERIA which should come in handy and go back 
    once you've collected it. Watch out for liquid gold because you'll slide 
    right into the spikes on the wall which won't kill you but will take away 
    some HP. So don't hold down the X button while on these spots. Now when 
    you past this area you are given a choice of five rooms to go in. Just go 
    to the second room from the left but if you want the item in the fourth 
    room from the left go ahead but you'll fight a tough battle. Well along 
    the way if you took the second tunnel from the left you are forced to 
    fight spiders along the way which are initiated when you touch the spider 
    webs. When your through equip your characters with something that 
    protects fire by using the ELEMENTAL-POISON MATERIA combination. And 
    equip your characters with some CURE or ICE MATERIA and all your summons 
    except IFRIT. Now approach the wall that has a golem on it to ensue a 
    fight.

BOSS: Gi Nattak and Soul Fires HP: 5500 and Soul Fires 1300 Item: Pheonix Down and Wizer Staff
    Well first off attack it with Holy magic like CURE or CURE2. Ice 
    surprisingly will do regular damage despite the fact it is fire. You 
    can't kill it with a Pheonix Down or using LIFE. It'll posses your 
    character with its Soul Fires which will cast FIRE2 about every two or 
    three rounds.  Watch out when Gi Nattak drains your MP and HP. So 
    carrying a few ETHERs or HI-POTIONs should counter that. Use your max 
    amount of summons cause they'll do more damage than you can dish out you 
    can't paralyze it but still.

    After this somewhat easy boss follow Bugenhagen out of the cave and pick 
    up the GRAVITY MATERIA on the way out. Now you'll go into a storyline 
    about Seto, Nanaki's father and realizing the hero that was his father. 
    Now head out of Cosmo Canyon and Red XIII will meet up with you. Now take 
    you Buggy north pass the shallow body of water up to Cloud's and Tifa's   
    hometown, Nibelheim, which is a town in front of a mountain.


NIBELHEIM
    There's basically nothing to do here. And I thought this town was suppose 
    to be a pile of soot remember? Well you can pick up some weapons in the 
    mansion in the back of the town and aquire Vincent but the boss is 
    awfully tough so you might want to wait until your stronger. For now talk 
    to the fallen black mages or whatever and they'll give you an item. Now 
    exit though the back of the town. You might want to save right in front 
    of the mountain so that when you encounter a Dragon you can start off 
    right in front of the mountain just incase you lose cause this guy is 
    tough. Now when you enter the mountain just walk through the linear path 
    but amke sure to pick up a few items on some of the mountain ridges like 
    the RUNE BLADE or the PLUS BARRETE. Next comes the long bridge cross it 
    and enter the next room. This room you'll see pipes to the left screen 
    and enter one of them at a time to reach some unreachable items. Now all 
    you need to do is to go down the ladder and save and fight a few battles 
    to bump up a level or two before fighting the creature standing in front 
    of the exit. There is a door on the left side of the room if you want to 
    pick up a SNIPER CR if you have Vincent in your party otherwise just 
    fight.

BOSS: Materia Keeper HP:8400 Item: Jem Ring
    This guy is tough. His Trine attack will cause 500 HP of damage to each 
    character, fortunately its a lighting based attack so having the 
    ELEMENTAL MATERIA-LIGHTING combination in your armor will protect against 
    it. As usual use your best attacks and magic and limit breaks and 
    summons. Make sure you have a CURE-ALL combination so that after the 
    Trine attack you can keep your HP up. These simple procedures should make 
    a very tough fight alot easier. If you have the ENEMY-SKILL MATERIA you 
    can learn Trine.

    Afterwards pick up the Counter Attack Materia left behind by the Materia 
    Keeper. Now just use a TENT and save and exit the reactor and walk 
    northwest towards the next destination, Rocket Town.


ROCKET TOWN
    When you first enter here your welcomed to shop around and if you talk to 
    the guy standing in front of the item shop and look at the rocket. If you 
    do he'll give you the YOSHIYUKI, which is the strongest sowrd in the game 
    up till now and the only chance you can get the YOSHIYUKI. Now go two 
    houses from the right of the Rocket and enter the house to pick up a 
    POWER SOURCE. From there enter the house that's to the right of thr 
    Rocket and enter the the room in the top left corner to pick up Barret's 
    DRILL ARM, which is a short range weapon  so unless you decide to equip 
    Barret with it, you'll have to move him up front in your row. Now head 
    out the backdoor to see the unusable(as of now) Tiny Bronco. Shera will 
    come in and tell you about the Shinra Space Program that has a 
    possibility to restart when President Rufus arrives. Now go to the Rocket 
    and climb the top to meet Cid, an expert pilot and engineer in mechanics 
    and tools, with a bad attitude due to a crewman's fault that made hi 
    abort a space mission, which was his life long dream. He won't let you 
    use the Tiny Bronco, now leave him be and go back to the house you met 
    Shera earlier. Cid now comes in and lets his mouth unload with his high 
    use of profanity. Now go talk to Cid again and you'll find out that Rufus 
    wasn't even thinking about the Space Program and he wants to use the Tiny 
    Bronco to chase after Sephiroth. Now go back inside the house and go back 
    to the Tiny Bronco and you'll find that Palmer is trying to steal the 
    Tiny Bronco, the wierd guy Shera just told you about.

BOSS: Palmer HP: 6000 Item: Edincoat
    This boss should be pretty easy as long as you use CHOCO/MOG MATERIA or 
    Aeris' Seal Evil to paralyze him. His Mako Gun can couse up to 1,000 HP 
    of damage depending on what armor and materia your eqipped with. If he 
    becomes un paralyzed then keep using the CHOCO/MOG MATERIA to paralyze 
    him again and the fight should be short lived. Afterwards a truck from 
    out of nowhere hits him when he tries to run and I have no idea where the 
    truck came from or how it got there, which is really one of the minor 
    faults in the game.

    Now the plane starts and the team doesn't know how to stop it. The plane 
    runs through the middle of the town and Cid quickly hops on and Rufus 
    orders fire on the plane and the Tiny Bronco puts out a few last miles 
    before it goes crashing into the ocean as a boat. Now head east of 
    Gongaga to a weapon seller.


WEAPON SELLER
    Here is a weapon seller and he'll tell you about the Keystone needed for 
    the Temple of Ancients. The Weapon Seller tells you about selling it to 
    Dio, owner of the Gold Saucer. Now head towards the Gold Saucer.


GOLD SAUCER
    When you enter here just go to the Battle Arena and look at the Show Room 
    which has the Keystone, examine it and Dio comes in. Now you must fight 
    for the Keystone in a little risk battle. All you have to do is fight in 
    the battle and he'll give you the keystone. It doesn't matter if you win 
    or not, but if you do win(which is highly unlikely) you'll be rewarded 
    with the Protect Vest and the Choco Feather which are two very strong 
    pieces of armor up to this point in addition to the Keystone. Now leave 
    the Gold Saucer, and what do you know, the Railroad Tran is out of order, 
    and what a coincidence now that you have the Keystone. You'll have to 
    stay the night at the Ghost Hotel. During the middle of the night Aeris 
    will come in depending on how well you treated her and you'll have a 
    chance to visit all the rides for free. Look out the same time Aeris 
    looks out of the Tran and you'll see some nice graphics that the 
    Squaresoft Team has produced. If you had treated Aeris poorly you'll get 
    a boring talk with some other party member. After you have taken part in 
    a stage show then took the little ride on the Roller Coaster you'll fine 
    Cait Sith with the Keystone, follow him around and you'll soon discover 
    that Cait Sith is a spy as he hands over the Keystone to Tseng of the 
    Turks. You have no choice but to have him remain in your party because he 
    knows where the Temple of Ancients is. Now head out Gold Saucer and head 
    southeast of Gold Saucer and into the giant black pyramid like shape 
    that's planted in the middle of a forest.


TEMPLE OF ANCIENTS
    When you enter here you'll get a quick briefing of BLACK MATERIA and find 
    Tseng of the Turks wounded on the floor. Here he'll give you the Keystone 
    and asks you to place it on the Altar to open up the Temple's maze. Well 
    I can't really help you out much here, do to the fact that's its so 
    complicated to explain, but you should follow the Old Sage around until 
    you fine his quarters or chamber and he'll let you rest unlimtedly. So 
    you can gain some levels and save and head out to the second part of the 
    maze. Once again no dice here either but make your way around until you 
    see another Old Sage and follow him into a room with rolling U shaped 
    boulders. Here is a little bit tricky but if you time it so that the cut 
    out part of the boulder lands where your standing then you should be 
    fine, don't worry if you get rolled over by the boulders because you 
    won't lose any HP or fight random battles. Just keep doing this until you 
    reach the end so that the trap shuts off by itself and then enter the 
    pool you saw earlier. Here you'll see exactly what happened. Afterwards 
    go into the Clock Room. Now there are twelve doors in which you can enter 
    here is whats inside each room:

1- Random Battle
2- Nothing
3- Random Battle
4- Aeris' Ultimate Weapon(Princess Guard)
5- Ribbon
6- Next Destination
7- Trumpet Shell
8- Mega Elixir
9- Nothing
10-Entrance
11-Nothing
12-Exit of Temple(You can't leave now, but later on)

    After you have picked up everything you can knock yourself down into the 
    pit when the second hand hits where your standing you can pick up the 
    Nail Bat which is the strongest sowrd in the game as of now. You'll be 
    force to fight a battle but its a battle that's easily won. Now head to 
    room number 6. When you enter here you'll find that the guy has just 
    locked the door leading to your next area. He'll run into the door on the 
    left and you must follow him, but all you have to do is go all the way to 
    the left side but don't enter the door and jump down, now don't jump any 
    further. Head to the second door from the right and enter in there and 
    he'll give up and unlock the door and let you rest and save. Now enter 
    the unlocked door and you'll encounter Sephiroth and see a couple of 
    scenes. It appears that Sephiroth wants the BLACK MATERIA to damage the 
    Earth and have the Soul energy be a part of him. Devious huh? Try to 
    equip something protects well from physical attacks and not magic before 
    you fight the Red Dragon.

BOSS: Red Dragon HP: 6800 Item: Dragon Armlet and BAHAMUT MATERIA
    This a rather easy fight. MAke sure you hit it with your strongest Ice 
    Spells and use BIO2 or BIO if your not up there yet to gradually reduce 
    his HP. REGEN is an excellent way to keep your HP up and you should never 
    have to heal if you have REGEN along.

    Now Equip the BAHAMUT MATERIA on Aeris after you have picked it up from 
    the floor. Head to room twelve you saw in the clock room earlier. Make 
    sure you save and heal before moving on. Here you'll notice that the wall 
    is warm and its moving.

BOSS: Demon Gate HP: 12000 Item: Gigas Armlet
    This guy is tough. I lost a few times and finally gain some levels to 
    beat this oversized wall. Regen should be casted once the battle starts 
    so you won't have to keep healing.  Use BAHAMUT immediately, it'll do 
    about 3,000- 4,000 DMG. Slow works on him quite nicely and sorry you 
    can't kill it with a PHEONIX DOWN or casting LIFE. Its also immune to 
    Holy Magic like CURE or CURE2 despite it being a undead monster. 
    Sometimes your characters will turn to stone so having 4 or 5 softs 
    should keep you in battle, but he rarely uses it, and if he uses it alot, 
    your in bad luck! Keep hitting him with your strongest attacks except 
    TITAN because is a part Earth and will cut the damage down significantly. 
    After a long tough fight you should win and become very weak.

    After the tough fight Cait Sith will come and sacrifice himself so that 
    the BLACK MATERIA stays out of Sephiroth's hands. As the team exits the 
    temple everything caves in and the Temple becomes the BLACK MATERIA. Now 
    that the dirty work by Cait Sith is done Sephiroth comes in and forges, 
    bends, and manipulate Cloud's mind to force him to hand over the BLACK 
    MATERIA. Later Cloud turns on Aeris and goes Berserk as the third member 
    of your party(whoever that is) has to knock Cloud out as Cait Sith number 
    2 comes along. Thought he was gone didn't ya? Well he didn't die sice he 
    wasn't alive to begin with. He was only a toy(if you hadn't known) and 
    all of the previous stats and armor and weapons and materia is still with 
    Cait Sith #2. Now when Cloud is unconcious Aeris appears in his dreams 
    and tells him she has to go and stop Sephiroth, but Sephiroth knows her 
    intentions and her plans. When Cloud awakens go to the Gongaga coastline 
    to fine the Tiny Bronco and head for the north most continent that has 
    the Tundra climate and head for a giant fossil that stands in the middle 
    of the forest just of the southern part of the northern continent.


THE LUNAR HARP AND CITY OF ANCIENTS
    Here all you need here is the LUNAR HARP to avoid running the same 
    scenario over and over again. You need the Harp to wake the sleeping 
    forest. Talk to the guy standing behind the open treasure chest to ask 
    him to start digging for the harp. It'll cost you 100 Gil which is very 
    cheap to have one man start digging the area you choose, you can place as 
    many as five workers, but all you need is one. Now dig a few feet away 
    just off the entrance of the Sleeping Forest to find the LUNAR HARP. If 
    you want you can buy some DIAMOND BANGLES which offer some solid 
    protection against magics and physical harm or some RUNE ARMLETs which 
    offer poor protection but doubles your MATERIA growth with four unlinked 
    slots. When your done head for the forest. Now when you enter, the forest 
    awoke and lets you pass, after the first walkway you'll enter an area 
    that's lightly densed with trees. Wait a few seconds and you'll see a red 
    materia hopping around. Grab it to recive the KJATA SUMMON MATERIA. The 
    next area is fairly linear but when you first enter walk under the broken 
    tree trunk and pick up the WATER RING in the treasure chest. Equip it 
    with any party member you like but its wise to equip it on the weakest 
    character or most likely the character with the least amount of HP for 
    later. The path to the City of Ancients is an excellent way to earn 
    expierience. Three to five battles will easily gain you a level since the 
    enemies come in groups and each one of them give away lots of 
    expierience. So its not a bad idea to fight a coulpe of battles to bulk 
    up your levels. When you reach the center with three paths, take the path 
    on the right and enter the hut shaped house and pick up an ELIXIR, GUARD 
    SOURCE, and the 2nd ENEMY SKILL MATERIA. The paths ahead are not 
    important and you can't enter there because the team won't let you. The 
    top path just leads to a middle area for later in the game. Now take the 
    left path to find a MAGIC SOURCE and an AURORA ARMLET. Here you'll get a 
    chance to save, and rest. Rest first then save, and you must rest to 
    continue the story. During your nap Aeris will call for you, now you 
    awake and head for the center part of the Ancient city. When you reach 
    the center take the spiral staircase up to fine the COMET MATERIA which 
    will most likely come in handy. When you reach the very center of the 
    city Cloud will stop the team members and he'll take a look at what's 
    going on. He then tries to kill Aeris, but the team stops him just in 
    time. If your wondering whats taking so long when Cloud holds his sowrd 
    and does nothing its because you haven't hit the O button. Just hit the O 
    button when Cloud is about to kill Aeris. Sephiroth can't force you to 
    kill Aeris himself so he comes and finishes his dirty work. Yes, Aeris
    (one of the main characters, like Tellah the Sage in Final Fantasy 4 or 
    General Leo in Final Fantasy 6, you can't bring them back to life with 
    the exception of General Leo, not with a code or game shark) is dead. Yes 
    I was in shock too but not in tears(because I can take it) and Sephiroth 
    flies away(how did he learn to fly?) and leaves you with Jenova-Life for 
    you to deal with. Remember you had the WATER RING earlier? Well this is 
    the time to equip it, all of Jenova's attacks will heal you.

BOSS: JENOVA HP: 10,000 Item: Wizard Braclet
    Like I said before its an excellent idea to equip the WATER RING to turn 
    all Jenova's attacks into healing purposes. If you want to make it a 
    quick fight use TITAN MATERIA or QUAKE2 or QUAKE3 depending on your 
    levels, BAHAMUT is also a good idea and so is using COMET. If you have 
    the ENEMY SKILL MATERIA you can learn AQUALUNG from this ugly monster, 
    but if you don't, then don't worry cause you'll have plenty of chances to 
    learn it later. Its attacks are very strong and can knock out any party 
    member with one or tow rounds. Just wait after your party members have 
    been wounded and let Jenova heal you until her skill has run out. Now you 
    can bring back your party members to life and heal them and take out 
    Jenova. That way you won't lose the expierience or ability points because 
    the expierience and ability points from your dead party members will not 
    be transfered to you like previous Final Fantasy games which is a big 
    minus in the game. Overall you should have no trouble thanks to the WATER 
    RING.

    After the easy battle you will pay your final respects to Aeris as they 
    lay her body in the waters in the city as she sinks back to the Earth. 
    Now is no time to greive, she didn't even budge when Sephiroth was near 
    and she did it for a reason. She was praying for the ultimate WHITE 
    MATERIA to counter the ultimate BLACK MATERIA which is HOLY. Remember in 
    those Final Fantasy games for the Super Nintendo when you had possesion 
    of both HOLY and METEO? Well never mind. The HOLY MATERIA fell into the 
    water but the team didn't know what to do with it. Yes I know your angry 
    and so was I, but Aeris doesn't want you to greive, she wants you to take 
    back the BLACK MATERIA before Sephiroth summons it, now go head for the 
    Correl Valley cave, you know the place you couldn't go to earlier? And 
    don't forget to flip to your second CD.

---------------------------------[ DISC 2 ]----------------------------------

ICICLE INN
    Here your welcomed to explore the town cause there are serveral free 
    items like a HERO DRINK, VACCINE, TURBO ETHER, and an X-POTION. Now go to 
    the back of town and the resident stops you, now Elena comes in and she's 
    furious about what happened to Tseng, now you are given the choice to 
    either dodge her punch by pressing right or left and she'll roll down 
    Icicle Inn or you do nothing and let Elena hit you in the stomach and you 
    faint. She even wonders why you didn't try to dodge her punch. When you 
    wake up you'll be in Ifalno's house or more likely Aeris' mother house. 
    You can check the equipment to learn more about Aeris' mother and the 
    Cetra or the called the Ancients. Now you'll need some supplies and a map 
    of Great Glacier if you ever hope to find your way around. First ask the 
    kid you met earlier about the snowboard and he'll let you borrow it. Now 
    head for the right most house in Icicle Inn and inspect the map that is 
    in the center of the house and take it. Now revisit the guy at the back 
    of town who wouldn't let you through earlier and he'll let you through 
    now that you have some supplies. 


WHOOPIE! SNOWBOARDING!
    Well here this is very linear and very fun. When you encounter a fork in 
    the road it doesn't matter which path you take because your basically 
    going to the same place just taking a different route. This place is very 
    complicated and will often confuse you. The only item of importance is 
    the ALEXANDER MATERIA. The other non-important item includes a MIND 
    SOURCE, POISON MATERIA, SAFETY BIT, ELIXIR, and an ALL MATERIA. Basically 
    you can wait until you pass out from the cold and Mr.Holzoff will rescue 
    you and you can rest and save at his house anytime you want. 
    Coincidentaly his house is right in front of your destination, the Gaea 
    Cliffs. But if you want the ALEXANDER SUMMON MATERIA, follow these 
    instructions:

       Just battle a few times and wait until you faint

       Now when you arrive at Mr.Holzoff's house go outside

       Now return to great glacier and go right

       Just remember that the wind blows you off course so when the wind 
       blows stop and wait until the wind dies down and continue going right

       Just make it past through the linear course until you see some cliffs

       Keep going right until you see your path stop and until you see three 
       different paths in front of you, take the most upper right handed path

       you'll encounter another linear area just keep going

       now take the cave in the upperright hand corner and enter it

    When you enter this cave make sure you have touched the Hot Springs you 
    saw earlier or else you can't intiate a fight.


BOSS: Snow HP: 4000 Item: ALEXANDER SUMMON MATERIA
    Okay this isn't exactly a boss, but it does play the boss music so I 
    count it as a BOSS, but it has low HP and your party should have no 
    trouble with it whatsoever. FIRE2 or FIRE3 should make quick work of her, 
    infact you should only need to cast it once, most likely.

    Now all you can do is just wait and faint until you arrive at 
    Mr.Holzoff's house and continue north towards the Gaea Cliffs. Make sure 
    to rest and save before heading on.


GAEA CLIFFS
    This part is very linear, so just climb up until you reach a cave but at 
    each ledge hit the "square" button to warm Cloud up so that his 
    temperature is at 37 degrees but don't let it fall below 28 degrees or 
    you'll wind up at Mr.Holzoff's place again forcing you to start over from 
    the beginning. When you reach the cave just continue to walk and into the 
    next room. If you encounter a Stilva and you have the ENEMY SKILL MATERIA 
    equipped then you can learn MAGIC BREATH which is a very powerful ENEMY 
    SKILL. All you need to do now is go to the left room and that's it.  When 
    you enter it you'll come across a bridge over the entrance of the cave, 
    go straight and pick up an ELIXIR(I'm not sure if it was an elixir) it 
    should be behind the wall and into the hidden room straight ahead. Now 
    return out of the secret room and stop just in front of the entrance to 
    the secret room and go up and walk around another bridge and into the 
    next area, but don't foget to pick up the JAVELIN for Cid just near the 
    bridge in a blue treasure chest. Now go straight into the next room and 
    you should reappear at the top of the room on a small ledge with a 
    boulder in front. Push the boulder over and watch it carefully to see 
    what it knocks over. Remember where you couldn't get through earlier 
    because of the ice? Well return there and go through that path. Now keep 
    going through these paths until you reach a room with two doors and a 
    treasure chest on the top left corner that's inaccessible for now. Just 
    head right and in the next room you'll encounter some giant icicles that 
    stand in your way, and for some reason they fight back. All you have to 
    do is destroy the Icicles with a regular DEMI spell that costs just 
    fourteen MP's. Ignore the Evilheads because they are hard to hit and will 
    distract you from the real target. Destroy the Icicle and the Evilheads 
    go with it. Just do this four times and reach the treasure chest at the 
    end of the walkway and including the one near the entrance and fall down 
    below. And enter the room with icicle platforms in front of the door. 
    When you reach the other side of the mountain collect the ENHANCE SOWRD 
    that sits right in front of your face in a yellow treasure box and 
    continue until you reach the outside of the mountain and climb again and 
    don't forget to hit the "square" button to keep Cloud's temperature above 
    37 degrees Celcius. Now when you reach inside you'll see a save point, 
    first gain a level or two and have the party touch the hot springs to 
    recover HP and MP and equip yourself with Materia combinations in your 
    armor that protects against FIRE and ICE and QUAKE. I suggest having your 
    MATERIA with FIRE3 and ICE3 before moving on because this next battle 
    will be extremely tough. Now save your game and enter the next room when 
    ready. When you enter the hallway an Old Sage is defeated and now you are 
    forced to fight Schizo.

BOSS: Schizo HP: 36,000 Item: Dragon Fang
    This boss fight is one of the toughest you'll ever encounter. They 
    constantly attack with hard hitting spells like FIRE2 or FIRE3 or ICE2 or 
    ICE3. Use FIRE3 on the right side and ICE3 on the left side. Don't use 
    KJATA because you'll be healing them both and don't use IFRIT or SHIVA 
    because you'll cause damage to one side but recover another side. And if 
    you learned MAGIC BREATH don't use it here. REGEN is an excellent way to 
    start things off as HASTE will to. If you don't have those high fire and 
    ice spells yet use QUAKE3 or LIGHTNING3 or RAMUH, or BAHAMUT or COMET. 
    Just use hard hitting non-ice or fire spells but having ICE3 and FIRE3 
    would be alot easier to manage. When one of the heads are defeated it 
    will cast QUAKE3 causing about 800-1200 HP of damage, and yes they can 
    cast it serveral times before they are defeated. You'll know one of the 
    heads is defeated when the defeated side's head slouches down. Yes all 
    you get is a DRGAON FANG which is a very cheap item since it just cast 
    LIT3 on all opponents and wasted after one use.

    When your done save the game and rest before heading on. Now leave the 
    cliffs through the path of the defeated Schizo and climb up the mountain 
    to reach the sunken crater.


SUNKEN CRATER
    Now just go down the crator until you've reach a save spot. Now save and 
    make sure to pick up and equip the NEO BAHAMUT MATERIA that's just right 
    in front of the save point. When your done continue towards the center of 
    the crater and watch for the green wind and only cross it when the green 
    wind calms down when you enter it while its moving then your bumped back 
    and forced into a fight. Make sure to check the fallen Old sages for some 
    items. In the next are is pretty straight foward(linear, if you didn't 
    know what linear meant) just make sure to pick up a KAISER KNUCKLE for 
    Tifa and check the Old Sages for some items. The next part is the same as 
    before, just enter when the wind is calm or you will be forced into a 
    fight. In the next path don't forget to collect the POISON RING and the 
    MP TURBO MATERIA. Now equip the FIRE RING and keep the the materia you 
    had earlier in your armor that protects against FIRE and have your most 
    heavy magic user with a RIBBON to protect you from Silence. When you 
    reach the next area you will encounter Sephiroth but you won't get the 
    chance to fight him instead he has left a dirty surprise for you.

BOSS: Jenova Death HP: 25,000 Item: Reflect Ring
    Basically this enemy is pretty easy and using your CHOCO/MOG SUMMON 
    MATERIA should paralyze it. You can use SLOW but its not necessary, REGEN 
    is an excellent way to start off again so you won't have to restore some 
    HP during battle until REGEN wears off. When Jenova Death uses silence on 
    the team have your RIBBON equipped party member use ESUNA or have your 
    effected party members use an ECHO SCREEN or a REMEDY. 

    Afterwards give the BLACK MATERIA to either party member in your present 
    group. Now continue on but if your HP is low keep your party healed. 
    You'll flash through a series of past images you saw earlier that you saw 
    in Kalm. When you approach the green barriers these barriers will not 
    dicipate themselves so you need to dodge the green waves and lightning 
    bolts. Continue on until you have reached the crater core. Now Cloud will 
    see images of Zack and he laughs at them, but why is Tifa so sad? Shinra 
    will now come into the picture and whoever is carrying the BLACK MATERIA 
    will get a visit from Tifa and asks you to go to the center of the 
    crater. It was not Tifa but Sephiroth all along. Now the character 
    holding the BLACK MATERIA gives the BLACK MATERIA to Cloud and in turn 
    gives the BLACK MATERIA to Sephiroth. Now the defenders of the Earth are 
    awakened which are more obviously called WEAPONs. There are four WEAPONs 
    and Sephiroth has control of all four. These are very powerful creatures 
    but you only have to destroy one of them. The team escapes in the airship 
    but to no avail.


DEATH PENALTY
    A week later Tifa is locked up in a cell with Barret as they are about to 
    be publically executed on national television. The crater is now in a 
    protective magic barrier, the WEAPONs are running amock, and METEOR the 
    spell the team was suppose to stop has been summoned. All hope of ever 
    stopping Sephiroth has been killed. After you've seen a few scenes a 
    guard comes in and escort you to your deaths. Barret is furious that Tifa 
    is the first to die, but that doesn't matter. She is now strapped to the 
    sides of the gas chamber chair but apparently the guard has dropped the 
    key and does not even know it. Before the switch to the gas chamber is 
    released Shinra soldiers begin to fire on the EMERALD WEAPON and during 
    the distraction Cait Sith reveals himself and frees Barret. The two try 
    to open the gas chamber door but it won't open. Now talk to Cait Sith and 
    look for the control room to shut off the gas chamber. Now Scarlet locks 
    the room and Cait Sith tells Barret to go to the airport. Now the scene 
    switches back to Tifa's scenario and she has the chance to free herself. 
    First have Tifa use her legs(X button) twice to reach for the keys. Now 
    have have her sit up by hitting the "triangle" button. Now hit the 
    "triangle" and "X" button simultaneously together to put the key in her 
    mouth. Hit the "O" and "triangle" button simultaneously together to 
    unlock her arms. Now hit the switch to the left of the chair to shut off 
    the gas chamber. She can't open the door now so you switch to the next 
    scenario. The Shinra soldiers try effortlessly to stop the EMERALD WEAPON 
    but to no avail. The Weapon fires a giant beam into the gas chamber 
    blowing a hole in the wall. Junon responds by unleashing their super 
    cannon which sends off a huge blast that sends the EMERALD WEAPON back 
    into the water. Now climb out of the gas chamber down the long side of 
    the building and down the super cannon and you will meet Scarlet. She'll 
    slap you first but you will have the chance to slap her back so hit that 
    "O" button to slap back. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, its just 
    the fun part of the game. If you want to win just hit the "O" button 
    right before Scarlet gets a chance to slap back. Afterwards Tifa runs 
    down the super cannon and into the new airship, the Highwind. Well I 
    guess Cait Sith number two has better fortune telling skills than the 
    first one. Now you must find Cloud. Talk to everyone on board and head 
    out, but you can stop in the operations room to REST, SAVE, and to use 
    the PHS. Now go back to Icicle INN and talk to everybody for some 
    information about Cloud's dissapperance. They mention about a doctor to 
    the south. Head for Mideel an Island south of the Chocobo Ranch. 


MIDEEL
    When you reach the town pet the small puppy and Tifa will over hear the 
    two guys talking about a spikey haired guy washing up on shore. It's 
    obviously Cloud and now Tifa decides to stay with Cloud. Apparently Cloud 
    has been flooded with Mako poisoning. Cait Sith talks about how Nibelheim 
    was already raided and Shinra's next stop is North Corel. But who's the 
    new leader? Well they picked Cid in the middle of his nap! When you reach 
    North Corel, nothing has changed not even the enemies. When the team 
    reaches the center they can't do a thing but watch the Shinra train 
    leave, now Cid has to steal one of the trains. Once Cid catches up with 
    the train they must fight an enemy on each car, but the fights are easy. 
    When you encounter the Wolfmeister hit it with everything you've got 
    because it has 10,000 HP and you have no time to lose since you must stop 
    the train in ten minutes. The Wolfmeister gives away 10,000 expierience 
    points though! When you reach the front of the train you must fight two 
    Attack Squads which is a pretty easy battle. Now with the guards gone you 
    must stop the train before it colides with North Corel. Just hit the 
    control pad up and down continously and the "Triangle" and "X" button 
    continously to stop the train. If you don't manage to stop the train you 
    not only lose the HUGE MATERIA but you have to pay 50,000 Gil if you want 
    the ULTIMA MATERIA! Don't worry you won't have to start over. If you do 
    save the town you get the HUGE MATERIA nad the ULTIMA MATERIA for free. 
    Now go outside and save. Now head for Fort Condor just south of the 
    Mithril Mines from way back in the game. 


DEFEND FORT CONDOR NOW!
    When you reach here talk to the guy at the top and he'll ask you to pay 
    for some troops to defend against Shinra. You really don't need to 
    purchase any soldiers. When your in the strategy game just let the 
    soldiers come to you and you'll be forced to fight the Enemy Commander.

BOSS: ENEMY COMMANDER HP: 15,000 
    Hit this boss with everything you've got, he isn't even that hard 
    anyways.

    After the battle the Condor is killed but the Baby PHEONIX lives in an 
    egg. Go outside and check the egg to recive the PHEONIX SUMMON MATERIA. 
    Now go downstairs and talk to the guy who has his head on the table. He 
    will give you the second HUGE MATERIA. Now head back to Mideel.


RETURN TO MIDEEL
    Now when you return to Mideel make sure to save it outside. When you 
    enter the town ULTIMATE WEAPON arrives after you have talked to Tifa. Cid 
    blows his big mouth as the WEAPON comes in.

BOSS: ULTIMATE WEAPON HP: 18,000
    Basically just keep hammering away at this guy. But first keep an 
    MBARRIER up to cut down the damage of ULTIMATE WEAPON's attacks. If you 
    don't you'll be eating 1500 HP of damage to every character and don't 
    forget to cast REGEN. 

    Afterwards the tremors the ULTIMATE WEAPON caused forced the Lifestream 
    to burst through the town of Mideel. As Tifa tries to get Cloud out of 
    Mideel they are both caught in the middle of the Lifestream. 


WAKE UP CLOUD!
    Now Tifa has no idea where she is, she runs scared of the dark and sinks 
    into the darkness. Now Tifa enters Cloud's mind first talk to Cloud 
    that's sitting in front of Nibelheim which is the Cloud at the top. Here 
    you'll get the full scenario of what really happened at Nibelheim when 
    Cloud first arrived. Now talk to the Cloud on the left. Then on the 
    right. Apparently Cloud wanted to attract Tifa's attention and joining 
    SOLDIER seemed like the answer. Later when Sephiroth had gone mad and 
    destroyed Nibelheim Cloud apparently was in a Shinra uniform. Afterwards 
    Tifa heads to Mt. Nibel to avenge the death of her parents but fails and 
    Zack comes in(the guy from Gongaga and the guy in the picture) and 
    Sephiroth defeats him. Now Cloud comes in and takes Zack's sowrd and 
    slays Sephiroth apparently, but didn't Cloud get stabbed? We all saw it 
    with our own eyes right? So how did Cloud survive? Also Tifa was with 
    some boys the other day when she was very young and she went to Mt.Nibel 
    and one by one the three boys chickened off but Cloud was still trailing 
    behind her, later the bridge colapsed and Tifa was left in a coma for 
    days and Cloud was balme for hurting Tifa, being at the wrong place at 
    the wrong time. With the hidden truth uncovered Cloud has rejoined the 
    team and now must go to Junon. Before you go anywhere buy some Mimett 
    Greens from Chocobo Bill and feed it to the White Chocobo in the 
    destroyed Mideel up in the left part of town and tickle it behind its ear 
    to recive the CONTAIN MATERIA, which is basically an very strong 
    elemental materia with certain effects.


RETURN TO JUNON
    Remember where you had that big parade while disguised as a Shinra troop 
    for the celebration of the new president? Well now there is no need for a 
    disguise and you can go through the previous unaccesible elevator for the 
    very cheap price of ten gil. When you reach the top of Junon Cloud will 
    mention that something is missing. Well what is it? It's the Junon 
    Cannon! That's not important right now, for now just head straight down 
    the streets and keep going until you see a long hallway that goes up and 
    down, but this time go down instead of going foward. Now when you enter 
    the elevator two Subamrine Crew will attack to get a date with the 
    elevator operator, defeat them an continue on. When the elevator stops to 
    the left of Cloud you will see a dog, you can not access this area or 
    should you need to just keep going down the hallways until you see a save 
    point. Here is a good time to save your game. When your done head towards 
    the Underwater Reactor, when you enter the long underwater tunnel, you'll 
    occasionally encounter a Ghost Ship, you can morph it for a GUIDE BOOK if 
    you choose to decide to fight the EMERALD WEAPON, for more details go to 
    the Side Area section. When you enter the reactor you'll encounter alot 
    of Shinra Submarine Crews but they are not are to beat anyways. After you 
    have defeated all the troops take the underwater elevator down. When you 
    reach the reactor it is basically all linear when you encounter Reno of 
    the Turks he will leave a new invention behind to stall some time.

BOSS: Carry Armor HP: 38,000 Item: God's Hand
    This boss is very difficult so don't cry when you when lose. Lightning 
    spells surprisingly has a normal effect on this creature. It's arm has 
    10,000 HP each and the body is 18,000 incase your wondering. First set up 
    a BARRIER and MBARRIER or just cast WALL once on the entire party. REGEN 
    works really nice as well. HASTE is optional but watch for the Lapis 
    Laser attack causing about 1600 HP of damage to every party member but 
    having your MBARRIER on will cut the damage taken in half. Also when the 
    Carry Armor picks up one of your party members quickly destroy the arm 
    with everything you've got or if it kills the party member bring him/her 
    back to life. If he happens to capture two of your party members and the 
    third party member dies, you all die so becareful. Basically hit it with 
    everything you've got and no status effect like SLOW or MUTE will work on 
    the Carry Armor because it is a machine.

    After the hard fight the submarine escapes off with the HUGE MATERIA. But 
    luckily there is another submarine that is just about to leave, follow 
    the sub but collect the treasure chests on the way because theycontain 
    some very valuable items. There is also a treasure chest that is behind 
    the stairway leading to the submarine and the item contained in there is 
    the LEVIATHAN SCALES I suggest you take them because this is absolutely 
    the only time you can take them, If forgot to take them once and I even 
    tried digging for it in Bone Village but no dice there so just take it 
    although it is completely optional. You should use the LEVIATHAN SCALES 
    to put out the fire at the side of DA-CHAO in Wutai. When you reach the 
    submarine you will be forced to fight serveral battles with some 
    Submarine Crews defeat them and continue on until you reach the cockpit. 
    Now your friends from the parade are here but you do not have to fight 
    them, but if you do you will get the chance to steal a SHINRA ALPHA which 
    is a fairly pretty decent piece of armor, just make sure you steal it 
    from the commander. I chose to fight them though, ha! You should see the 
    reaction you get when you fight them during battle. If you do choose to 
    fight them, just use one COMET2 spell and they should be gone. If you 
    don't want to fight them they'll be held prisoners everytime you use the 
    submarine. Afterwards you will enter a mini game in a submarine battle.  
    Follow the red submarine and do not lose track of it because you have to 
    destroy the submarine in under ten minutes. You can fire up to four 
    torpedos at a time and always hit the R1 button incase you lose track of 
    the red submarine. After you have sunked the enemy submarine you can use 
    the submarine as a vehicle for the rest of the game but the only place 
    you can land it on is the port near Junon. Shinra does not know it, but 
    they accidently release information about the other HUGE MATERIA leaving. 
    When the team surfaces the plane leaves off with the HUGE MATERIA but 
    they know where the HUGE MATERIA is headed, Rocket Town.


RETURN TO ROCKET TOWN
    When you first arrive hear just go to the rocket and make your way to the 
    control room. Cid will be forced into your party on the way and make sure 
    to equip him well. When you get past the Attack Squads you will encounter 
    Rude of the Turks and two Attack Squads. 

BOSS: Rude HP: 10,000 
    There is basically no trouble coming from this boss. Hit it with 
    everything you've got like NEO BAHAMUT or COMET2. First take out the two 
    Attack Squads that will try to put you to sleep. When Rude's HP drops 
    below 1500 he will start to use CURE2, so make sure you save your strong 
    summons for the end of battle. If you have a STEAL MATERIA you can steal 
    a ZIEDRICH from Rude which can make the most strongest elemental spells 
    seem like the most weakest elemental spells. If you do not manage to 
    steal the item fear not, you will be given one more chance near the end 
    of the game.

    When you reach the control room the rocket is about ready to launch. But 
    Cid's dreams haven't passed yet. Cid decides to stear the rocket into 
    outer space. The rocket launches and is in a collision course with 
    METEOR. At this point Cid tells you about the HUGE MATERIA, wait a minute 
    how did Cid know where the HUGE MATERIA was? The HUGE MATERIA is locked 
    in the Rocket's core and Cid's clues will tell you how to unlock the 
    combination. But forget that, take out a sheet of paper and write this 
    down:

"Cirle", "Square", "X", "X"

    That's the combination for the lock. Regardless if you have gotten the 
    HUGE MATERIA or not its time to leave and there just so happens to be an 
    escape pod down through the engine room. Here a chunk of metal falls on 
    Cid and the team is unable to get Cid free and it really was a faulty 
    oxygen tank after all and Cid relizes what a mistake he made. But 
    coincidentally Shera is aboard the rocket and helps the team free Cid. As 
    the escape pod launches itself from the rocket the team witnesses the 
    explosion of the rocket against METEOR. At first the rocket might have a 
    chance to destroy METEOR but METEOR regroups and is on a collision course 
    to Earth with only days to spare. After the scenario take your submarine 
    and head for the underwaters and take your Submarine. Before you go down 
    just save your game and I mean it! When you go down here look for the red 
    submarine you sank earlier and search it for the last red HUGE MATERIA. 
    If you see a floating emerald colored piece of junk lying around in the 
    ocean, whatever you do IGNORE IT! If its in the way of something your 
    trying to get surface and then resurface so that the WEAPON has relocated 
    it self. Check my Side area section for more details. Now take all four 
    HUGE MATERIA to Cosmo Canyon and show them to Bugenhagen and he'll store 
    the HUGE MATERIA in his planetarium but not before you talk about how to 
    get rid of METEOR. Afterwards inspect the BLUE HUGE MATERIA to get the 
    BAHAMUT ZERO SUMMON MATERIA. Now you must head to the City of Ancients 
    but first you will need the key. Now go back to your submarine but save 
    before you go and head along the west wall and keep going until you see a 
    small cut between the rocks and enter it and through a tunnel and at the 
    end you should see the Key to the Ancients, inspect it and take it and 
    head for the City of Ancients.


RETURN TO CITY OF THE ANCIENTS
    Take you airship and head over north of Bone Village and into the City of 
    Ancients. When you reach the city go to the center of the city, no not 
    the place where Aeris got killed but to the place I mentioned earlier 
    that you needed to go for later on. When you reach here go to where 
    Bugenhagen is standing and he will start to talk about how Sephiroth's 
    evil presence keeps HOLY from reacting. You must kill Sephiroth to save 
    the world and that should be sweet! He has taken your family, home, and 
    even Aeris away from you, now you can finally settle the score. As you 
    leave the City of Ancients Cait Sith reports about about the Junon 
    Cannon. Now head for Midgar!


RETURN TO MIDGAR
    When the Highwind reaches here the groud releases huge tremmers as the 
    DIAMOND WEAPON is fast approaching. Land on the coast of Midgar and wait 
    a long while before it finally arrives. Right before the DIAMOND WEAPON 
    approaches the shores save your game. And make sure to put all party 
    members in the back row.

BOSS: DIAMOND WEAPON HP: 45,000 
    Ouch! You finally get to fight one of the weapons and I hope your levels 
    and materias are high enough. First off the basics, cast REGEN and WALL 
    on the entire party. Then cast HASTE but make sure you either have a 
    RIBBON equipped or if you have about ten ECHO SCREENs. Hit this guy with 
    everything you've got and it will still be standing. Your physical 
    attacks will do nothing against him so its a good idea to have a weapon 
    equipped with alot of materia slots, about 6-8 slots should do. Use 
    ULITMA, BAHAMUT ZERO, COMET2 just any of your strong spells and that 
    includes FIRE3 or ICE3 or LIGHTNING3. I'm not sure if DEMI works but its 
    worth a shot. You can also steal the RISING SUN from him which has a 
    quadruple Materia growth in the Japan version but a double Materia growth 
    in the U.S. version. When the DIAMOND WEAPON counts down to one it will 
    do the DIAMOND FLASH attack which will do 2500-3200 HP of damage to every 
    character so watch out and keep plenty of PHEONIX downs or have a PHEONIX 
    SUMMON or a LIFE or LIFE2 spell. DIAMOND WEAPON's basic attack can cause 
    about 500-1000 HP of damage but REGEN should easily counter that.

    Afterwards, the DIAMOND WEAPON is stunned, but is still headed towards 
    Midgar. Just sit back and relax and watch the cool graphics. The party, 
    apparently has given enough time for the Sister Ray to build up energy 
    from the seven Mako Reactors except for the one you destroyed earlier of 
    course. The Cannon's destructive power is huge isn't it? As the Cannon 
    builds up it quiets down and releases a giant cataclysmic blast that 
    blasts right through the DIAMOND WEAPON and blasts through the barrier 
    Sephiroth had up earlier.

    But the DIAMOND WEAPON had already fired the blast towards Midgar and 
    what do you know, he aimed for President Rufus. The president is now dead 
    but the team has more important issues at hand. Now use your TENT and 
    save your game and take the HIGHWIND to the Crater. Before the team lands 
    in the Crater Cait Sith or Reeve alerts the team about Hojo firing 
    another blast to the Crater which will put the entire city of Midgar in 
    danger and unless the team stops the cannon the city of Midgar could 
    explode!


STOP THAT CRAZY HOJO!
    You'll enter Midgar in parachutes and the view is quite breath taking 
    isn't it? Now follow Cait Sith to the underground sewers and save it if 
    you like. When you first arrive take the stairs down and continue down 
    until you see another ladder to the right of Cloud, climb the ladder to 
    get the ATLAS ARMLET. Now go down and go into the doorway that is in 
    front of a tunnel. Afterwards keep going until you see a treasure chest 
    that contains a STARLIGHT MICROPHONE. The floor will drop but take the 
    ladder on the dirty pipe and take the tunnel downwards. Now follow up to 
    the next area on the stairs and you should arrive at the save point. Save 
    your game and if you want to go back for the rest of the items you can. 
    Now when you enter the train tunnels the Turks will appear but it is your 
    choice if you want to fight them. If you do fight them, you will get a 
    good amount of expierience points but not only that each one of the Turks 
    are carrying a special piece of armor which you must steal from them in 
    order to get. If you stole from Rude earlier he won't have the Ziedrich.

BOSS: ELENA, RENO, and RUDE of the Turks HP: 83,000
    This is not an easy fight and is probably just as hard, if not harder 
    than the fight with the DIAMOND WEAPON. You must fight all three of them 
    at the same time. Elena has 30,000 Rude has 28,000 and Reno has 25,000 
    HP. Try to use SUMMONS and Spells that will hit all of the turks at the 
    same time. Start the battle off by casting REGEN and WALL and HASTE. Try 
    to avoid using elemental spells that hits all party members because each 
    one of the Turks absorbs a certain type of elemental magic. Elena absorbs 
    ICE, Rude absorbs FIRE, and Reno absorbs LIGHTNING. They all have no 
    weaknesses and GRAVITY spells does not work. SUMMON MONSTERs are a great 
    way to hit all members as is ULTIMA or COMET2. I think basically all you 
    have to do is concentrate on one of the Turks and when one of the Turks 
    has taken enough damage they all go away.

    Afterwards go back to the save point and use a TENT and save cause you 
    will need it. Now continue on and if you wish take a left and then take a 
    right to collect some really valuable items like Cait Sith's ultimate 
    weapon, or an extremely powerful GLOW LANCE for Cid. Also a really 
    powerful MASTER FIST for Tifa. After you have retrieved all the weapons 
    make sure to take a look at the banner that's all the the way in the back 
    wall of the lobby and go back to the train tunnels and continue forth 
    towards the Sister Ray. Now the team encounters the new weapon built by 
    Scarlet and Heidegger.

BOSS: Proud Clod HP: 100,000 Item: Ragnarok
    This boss has alot of HP and is very powerful so make sure you save 
    before fighting this guy. First off cast REGEN on the team and the cast 
    WALL. Use your strongest spells and summons against it. Its basic attack 
    can cause up to 1000 HP of damage which is the side guns and the Knee 
    Fire and he can do two in a row at any given time. Having REGEN should 
    counter that, but it is also a good idea incase your HP runs really low 
    and you don't want to wait for the REGEN. Also watch out for his MATERIA 
    JAMMER which will prevent a party member from using any magic, so keep 
    some ECHO SCREENs, REMEDIES, ESUNA, or have a RIBBON equipped. The 
    Rainbow Ray will cast Reflect on a party member and since  Proud Clod 
    doesn't have any magic attacks it will prevent the party member from 
    being healed so use DEBARRIER on that effected party member. Watch out 
    for his Beam Cannon, he will prepare for this attack when he gets on his 
    knees, this gives the party two rounds to attack unless you have HASTE 
    casted on your party which gives you three rounds to attack. Watch out 
    and be ready to heal after he does this attack because it will cause 1500 
    to 2000 HP of damage to all party members so have a CURE3 ready. 
    LIGHTNING will not work well against this guy because he has no 
    weaknesses so any negative status effect will not work either. There are 
    two parts to this guy, Armor and Body, it really does not matter if you 
    take out the armor or body first because you will cause the same amount 
    of damage. The Armor has 40,000 HP and the body has 60,000.

    Now equip Cloud's second strongest sowrd in the game which is the 
    Ragnarok after you have defeated Proud Clod. Now save and continue 
    onward. Watch out for the Grosspanzer, it is a random battle occurance. 
    This guy is like a mini boss, he looks like a tank with spikes on its 
    wheels. He has five parts to attack, beware though it might look like a 
    common enemy and has the HP for a boss, about 25,000 total. Its Ram 
    attack hits all party members that causes up to 1000 Hp of damage. Its 
    regular guns causes a 1000 HP of damage to a single character. First 
    destroy the cannon and all you have to worry about is the Ram attack. Try 
    running if you can because this guy gave me some trouble. Now continue 
    going on and if Barret is not in your party you will not find the MISSING 
    SCORE if Barret is not in your party, which is his ultimate weapon. Along 
    the stairway you will have serveral talks with all your other party. If 
    you want you can equip it but Materia will not grow while in the weapon. 
    Before you go any further equip someone with the COUNTER ATTACK MATERIA 
    and a RIBBON before moving on. At the top you will encounter Hojo, here 
    you will learn that Sephiroth is Hojo's son. And he needs to send another 
    blast of Mako energy to feed power for Sephiroth, although Sephiroth does 
    not know it Hojo is not about to let you interfere. Hojo has injected 
    himself with Jenova Cells which has given him mutagenic powers sorta like 
    the G-Virus in Resident Evil 2.

BOSS: Hojo HP: 11,000
    All you have to do is concentrate on Hojo and only Hojo. Its Capsule 
    attack does not do any damage but will call upon the Poodler Sample(HP: 
    10,000) and the Bad Rap Sample(Hp: 13,000). They will always come back to 
    life if you keep killing them. Now prepare for the next battle.

BOSS: Heletic Hojo HP: 64,000
    This boss is a little tough but you do not have to worry so much. The 
    Right Arm is taken out easily because it has 8,000 HP and that is the 
    first thing you should do. The body has 26,000 HP is should be taken out 
    next. The left arm has 30,000 HP and should be ignored. REGEN helps out 
    a lot in this battle but it is not needed.

BOSS: Lifeform Hojo HP: 30,000 Item: Power Source
    This form is the toughest of all three because its Combo attack hits the 
    party four times each hit causing about 250-500 HP of damage and a 
    different negative status effect. So a poorly equipped party member can 
    have POISON, MUTE, SLEEP, and SLOW effected on them all at the same time 
    after one Combo attack. Having the COUNTER ATTACK MATERIA mastered means 
    countering all four of Hojo's Combo attack without wasting a turn. Having 
    the RIBBON means that the party member that has the RIBBON on will not be 
    effected by anything Hojo throws at him. I once came poorly equipped and 
    lost because his Combo attack put all three of my party members to sleep 
    and he kept attacking until I was dead. So having the spell ESUNA ready 
    on a person equipped with a RIBBON is a good way to start out as keeping 
    a coulpe of ECHO SCREENS is not a bad idea. REGEN will keep some effected 
    party members alive for a bit while longer but if your asleep your just 
    delaying your "game over."

    After a strenous battle and getting nothing but a cheap POWER SOURCE you 
    hop on the highwind and approach the crater. MAke sure you make a save 
    point just outside of the crater so you can do other things you have 
    missed earlier in the game. 

-----------------------------------[ DISC3 ]---------------------------------

LET'S SETTLE THIS SEPHIROTH!
    Before you go down I suggest you learn BIG GUARD from the Beachplugs in 
    the beach area outside of Costa Del Sol before entering, just manipulate 
    the Beachplugs and have them use the BIG GUARD on your party members. 
    From here you will need to pack alot of FENIX DOWNs(99 tops) unless you 
    have the LIFE and LIFE2 spells because these enemies have instant death 
    attacks. Try to buy as much TENTs as you can as well. Do not worry, I 
    will try to guide you through on some of these enemies. When you first 
    enter here, it is very different from your last encounter in the crater. 
    At first you will see a treasure chest, pick it up to recieve the SAVE 
    CRYSTAL which is a very important item and key for your survival. Do not 
    use the crystal yet because with this item you can create a save point 
    anywhere in the crater as you wish, but you can only use this once and it 
    can only be used in the crater and no where else. Next to the treasure 
    chest is a door or a cave leading back to the Highwind incase you need 
    anything or just running low on supplies. Some enemies here are the 
    Parasite which can cast L5 Death so levels that are divisible by 5 that 
    means your party member with a level of 50 will die, do not worry though, 
    it almost never casts it though. You can also Manipulate these guys and 
    have them use the MAGIC BREATH on you if you have not learned it yet, 
    otherwise just keep attacking because all they do is the head attack. 
    When you see a Gargoyle I suggest you run unless you have levels that are 
    not divisible by 4, because the Gargoyles use this as their final attack 
    95% of the time. The Dark Dragon is pretty easy but at the levels your at 
    now, he can cause quite a stir. You can Manipulate him and have him use 
    the DRAGON FORCE and the LASER on a party member that has the ENEMY SKILL 
    MATERIA(in my opinion one of the best MATERIA in the game) so he or she 
    can learn the attack. As you continue down the spiral walkway you will 
    see a second treasure chest, which contains a GUARD SOURCE. Use them on 
    any party member and continue on until you reach the next area. Here to 
    the left of the screen you will find a POWER SOURCE and an HP ABSORB 
    MATERIA. Use the POWER SOURCE on anyone you like and continue on. Make 
    sure to explore all of this area if you want the items like a GUARD 
    SOURCE, MIND SOURCE, and an ELIXIR. This place is pretty small and you 
    should be through in no time. In the next area is a little complicated 
    but not too hard. First enter the door on Cloud's right which is the left 
    side of the screen. When you first enter here, ignore the treasure chest 
    that is on a small cliff on the left side of the screen. Here you will 
    notice a small hole on the top right of the screen on the rocks, go 
    inside that hole to reach the treasure chest on the top right cliff and 
    collect and use the POWER SOURCE and continue downward and collect the 
    last GUARD SOURCE in the crater and use it on any party member you like. 
    No go back to where you came in and go out the door. Do not go back up 
    but instead keep going to the right until Cloud falls through and on the 
    cliff he falls on has a treasure chest which contains a MIND SOURCE now 
    use it and continue on and keep going left until you reach the door and 
    enter it to pick up the MEGAELIXIR and go back out and enter the cave on 
    the right and continue through until you are outside and drop down and 
    continue to drop down on the right side until you see a treasure chest 
    pick up the item inside and continue downward. In the next area you will 
    meet up with the rest of the group. Here you will have to form groups 
    that splits into two. Have two members in your party go the right and 
    have the other four members go to the left. But if you choose to go to 
    the right yourself just have three members in your group and send the 
    other three to the left path. After that you cannot have the other party 
    member join you if you had him or her sent down the opposite path. If you 
    take the left path read below:


LEFT PATH
    Hopefully you have at least four people going down this path which is 
    comprised of two paths. Select two party members to go down the the other 
    two to go up. If Cloud chose to go up then continue on and you will see 
    some bright green terrain with a series of almost gold colored boulders 
    all surrounding a small pond. In this area you will encounter plenty of 
    Magic Pots and if you give them an ELIXIR and only the ELIXIR defeat them 
    afterwards to recieve 8000 Expierience Points and 1000 Ability Points. I 
    would not suggest giving up the ELIXIR because it can help you in the 
    fight against Sephiroth. Do not give these guys a MEGAELIXIR though 
    because it just will not work for some reason. Watch out for the Master 
    Tonberry which looks like a Mole holding a lit lantern with a star above 
    their heads. Here are the Master Tonberry's stats:

HP: 45,000
MP: 0
Morph: Ribbon
Steal: ELIXIR
Item: MEGAELIXIR

    At first he may seem harmless but attack him three times and he will use 
    the Everyone's Grudge attack on one party member, if your stats are high 
    it will do alot of damage. If your stats are low do not worry because it 
    should not do more than 500 HP of damage. At this point in the game when 
    Cloud gets hit by this attack he will most likely fall and you will need 
    to bring him back to life. After you have attacked him three times it 
    takes two hits for the Master Tonberry to counter attack depending on who 
    hit him last. Watch out when he gets to close because he can use his 
    Knife Attack which will instantly kill any party member.

    The only items in here are the REMEDY and the MAGIC SOURCE. Now keep 
    going and you will enter another area similar to the previous area. On 
    the right is the IMPERIAL GUARD, VACCINE and the SHIELD MATERIA which is 
    the shining green piece of Materia. On the right is the HERO DRINK. In 
    the next area you will find a bright shining pool of some sort in the 
    very center, inspect it to get the COUNTER MATERIA and just above it is 
    the W-MAGIC MATERIA. And enter the next area and you will be in the 
    crater core with the rest of your party. Now is probably the most perfect 
    spot to use the SAVE CRYSTAL. Save your game and use a tent. If you took 
    the Down path in the left path just follow through the linear path and 
    collect the REMEDY, REMEDY, X-POTION, X-POTION, TURBO ETHER, SPEED 
    SOURCE, and the MEGA ALL MATERIA. To get the MEGA ALL MATERIA which is 
    the shining purple materia keep hitting the "O" button as he jumps on the 
    platform, if you do not he will jump right over it. When you reach the 
    next area you will meet up with the rest of the party. Whether you chose 
    the Down or Up path you will always meet up at the same area. 


RIGHT PATH
    This place is extremely linear, the items worth getting are MEGAELIXIR, 
    MYSTILE, TETRA ELEMENTAL, ELIXIR, and a LUCK SOURCE. When you encounter a 
    Dragon Zombie you can learn SHADOW FLARE from it, but hopefully it will 
    hit the party member equipped wih the ENEMY SKILL MATERIA and also 
    PANDORA's BOX. Afterwards you will meet up with the rest of your party 
    members. NOTE: It does not matter which path you take UP, DOWN, or Right 
    you will always meet up at the same point. When you reach the meeting 
    point talk to everybody in your group and see what item they have 
    collected along the way. REMEMBER: Each party member will give you an 
    item they have collected on the way, but remember your party members did 
    not collect everything. When you have used a TENT and saved go down when 
    ready. When you enter the crater's core sometimes you engage in a random 
    battle you must win, especially against the Ironman. I have composed a 
    guide to beating him, because chances are your levels are not high 
    enough.

Random Encounter: Ironman HP: 20,000
    A very tough mini-boss and you probably have to fight serveral of these 
    before you reach the crater's core. Try to avoid Physical attacks because 
    this will have the Ironman use his Adrenaline skill which is a barrier 
    that will cut down all physical attacks down to half. Hit it with BAHAMUT 
    ZERO, ULITMA, or COMTET2 to deal some serious damage. Its basic attack 
    hits all party members dealing 800 HP of damage to each party member and 
    he can use this attack up to two times in a row. Watch out for the Grand 
    Sword attack which can cause up 1400 HP of damage to a single character 
    so be careful. Its a good way to start off the battle with BIG GUARD to 
    cut down the attacks. Move very quickly because this guy moves fast.

    As you continue to make your way down the core, in the middle Jenova-
    Synthesis will approach you.

BOSS: Jenova-SYNTHESIS HP: 80,000
    Jenova has three parts, two arms and body. The arms are composed of 
    10,000 HP each while the body is 60,000. Try to take out the arms first 
    so you will not have to deal with Jenova's quick attacks. Start off by 
    casting BIG GUARD or WALL and HASTE(BIG GUARD is actually both WALL and 
    HASTE and it only costs 56 MP and you can use it on all party members! 
    You should only have to cast this spell once, in my opinion I see no 
    disadvantages to this) and it is also nice to have Cloud with the SLASH-
    ALL MATERIA to hit all parts of the body at once. COUNTER ATTACK MATERIA 
    is a good way to hit back without wasting a turn. Use all of your best 
    magics and summons like BAHAMUT ZERO, NEO BAHAMUT, COMET2, ULTIMA, 
    anything that is strong and hits all parts of the body. Whne Jenova's HP 
    drops below 15,000 it will start a count-down of 5, when the timer hits 0 
    she will cast ULTIMA which is more than likely to kill your party 
    members. Just pray that the WALL is there to absorb some of the damage. 
    Move quickly and attack hard and the fight should not be too tough.

    After you have defeated Jenova for the last time, it is time to face of 
    against the Big Ogre himself, yes Sephiroth. Here Sephiroth's power stuns 
    the party at will, but while the party is near HOLY they are unaffected 
    by Sephiroth's mind power. Here you will form two or three groups, I 
    suggest two groups because you only have six people in your party. Have 
    your strongest group with Cloud and the other three in another group but 
    have them well equipped and have someone with the RIBBON on and also the 
    MYSTILE. Having the ESUNA spell ready is very important as well as having 
    a RIBBON equipped, the MYSTILE has a 60% magic evade rate, so 6 out of 
    ten attacks whether physical or maigcal you can evade. BIG GUARD is a 
    must. Heal your party's HP and MP to full and remember to equip your best 
    weapons and armors. After you are through it is time to settle the score.

BOSS: Bizzaro Sephiroth HP: 107,000
    Well this form of Sephiroth is not too tough, the only problem is, is 
    that you have five parts to Bizzaro Sepiroth. The head has 9,000 HP, the 
    Left Magic has 9,000, and the Right Magic has 9,000 HP as well. All those 
    three should be taken out first. Next is the Torso which has 30,000, and 
    then comes the main target: the Core: 50,000. You should use magics that 
    hits all parts of Bizzaro Sepiroth. Use your strongest magics like 
    BAHAMUT ZERO or ULTIMA, COMET2 does not really add a punch because 
    Sepiroth cuts the COMET2 damage down to a half. The Core is invincible 
    except when you destroy all the other four parts to Bizarro Sephiroth. 
    Bizarro Sephiroth is incredibly slow at attacking so having HASTE on the 
    group means a huge advantage. BIG GUARD and REGEN is a must. When Bizzaro 
    Sepiroth uses his Fallen Angel attack, it will put all party members HP 
    down to one, but if you have REGEN you will be just fine if you have not 
    used REGEN then use CURE3 if REGEN has lost its affect. This guy can also 
    hit the party members with serveral different negative status effects 
    like Frog, Poison, Mute, etc. Did I mention this guy has a DEMI3 attack? 
    So watch out for that attack, but on the good note it will build your 
    Limit Break guage very fast. Bizzaro Sephiroth also has a physical attack 
    that causes up to 3,000 HP of damage to a single character up front so 
    watch out, and keep all magic users in the back. Bizzaro Sephiroth also 
    can revive fallen parts when he does the Bizzaro Energy and in turn also 
    heal the Torso. This is one of the longest fights, and it took me a good 
    twenty minutes to beat this guy. Also when your Max Summons runs out just 
    switch to your other party when you have defeated one of the parts and 
    then switch back. Also have Cloud use his FINISHING TOUCH over the 
    METEORAIN, that way you can hit all four parts to Bizzaro Sephiroth 
    without the risk of having one of the METEORs hit the Core which will do 
    no damage.

    After this fight the party with Cloud in it will fight the last and final 
    battle. All positive and negative status will be carried onto the next 
    fight except you will still have your maximum amount of summons still 
    intact.

BOSS: Safer-Sephiroth HP: 120,000
    When your BIG GUARD wears down you should still be in HASTE for the 
    remainder of the battle. But when your barriers wear down immediately set 
    them up again and do not wait to cast BIG GUARD the next available party 
    member should cast WALL if your Materia is high enough. Wearing a RIBBON 
    is very important in this battle because his Pale Horse attack will hit 
    you with every status effect in the book. Unless you have a LIMIT BREAK 
    ready Sephiroth will immediately start the battle off by casting WALL, 
    and it will last through the battle unless you have DEBARRIER to remove 
    it, and you must do so if you want to stand any chance of winning. Watch 
    out for the SHADOW FLARE attack, which can cause up 7,000 HP of damage to 
    one character, hopefully if you have SHIELD it can easily nullify it, but 
    if you have not been gaining Ability Points for the Materia then 
    hopefully your BIG GUARD can cut it down to about 5,000, which is 
    probably still enough to kill you. Watch out for Safer-Sephiroth's 
    Summon, the SUPERNOVA. Sephiroth calculates all the math into this 
    whopping behemoth as he summons what the Japaneese think will destroy the 
    world. This is a really long summon and it looks awesome! First he 
    summons the SUPERNOVA from a distant galaxy thousands of light years 
    away, then it enters the Milky Way, then into our Solar System, now is 
    where the real fun begins. The SUPERNOVA then engulfs Pluto, Saturn, 
    Jupiter, Neptune, then enters the sun which destroys Venus and Mercury 
    and the flares of the sun crash land on earth and directly on the party 
    which will drop all the party's HP down to serveral hundred and it does 
    not matter how much HP you have and also it will hit the party with all 
    the negative statuses in the book, but have a RIBBON prevents all of the 
    negative statuses, make sure your REGEN is still working and you will 
    most likely have to use a CURE3 along with the REGEN. Use everything you 
    have against this guy as well as limit breaks. This guy moves fast so it 
    is a good idea to keep HASTE on the whole battle and quickly remove any 
    negative status effects, do this and you should win the long tough 
    battle.

    After the battle, well this part is a real spoiler, so continue to read 
    on if you do not mind having the ending spoiled for you. 

---------------------[ Ending (CAUTION: SPOILERS!) ]-------------------------

    Here the party can only wait for what approaches next. As the party 
    leaves Cloud trails behind them, but Cloud is still feeling Sepiroth's 
    presence. Now as Cloud tries to break free of Sephiroth's hold he splits 
    apart from his body and goes off to finally settle the score. Here Cloud 
    travels through a portal that leads to Sephiroth. Here you will be forced 
    into the last battle against Sepiroth and it does not matter because you 
    are not suppose to lose, so show Sephiroth how strong you have becomed, 
    OMNISLASH style. Regardless if you have the OMNISLASH or not Cloud will 
    do it anyways and if you have not seen yet, here is your chance to sample 
    just how powerful it is, as Cloud goes berserk and does count' em twenty 
    slashes each causing at least 3,000 HP of damage to him. If you just wait 
    for Sephiroth to attack Cloud will just counter attack and you will see 
    no OMNISLASH. After the quick battle Sepiroth's body and mind rips apart 
    after his humiliating defeat and bursts into a stream of light. Cloud 
    sees Aeris' and reaches for her hand but when reality starts to break 
    loose it is really Tifa who is trying to pull him up and escape, but the 
    rocks around Tifa break off but Cloud's quick reflexes save her as they 
    jump onto the next platform. Tifa wonders if the other party members are 
    safe and they are and suddenly hit with a small earthquake as the 
    Highwind falls down below. The party hops on aboard but something's 
    wrong, they can not get free, but luckily Cid's excessive cursing and 
    emergency switch boosts the Highwind out of the collapsing crater. As the 
    party escapes they wonder if they had worked fast enough for the HOLY 
    MATERIA to work and METEOR is fast approaching as the scene switches to 
    Midgar as Marlene looks out the window and METEOR has already started to 
    destroy Midgar, but HOLY moves and slows down METEOR but HOLY is not 
    enough and hope looks bleak. Wait! What's that? The Lifestream? It is 
    countering METEOR along with HOLY as METEOR begins to break up. 
    Afterwards Aeris' face appears. The credits roll and at the end it is 500 
    hundred years into the future and Nanaki is the only one left alive from 
    the group as he sees Midgar bright as day and full of green plants and he 
    has never seen a more prettier site. 

                                  THE END

BOSS: ULTIMATE WEAPON 40,000 Item: Ultima Weapon
    Here just start the battle off by using BAHAMUT ZERO and he should fly

SUNKEN GELNIKA
    West of the Underwater Reactor you will find the sunken ship in a passage 
    between some rocks. This area is not big and is very linear. When you 
    enter here use the save spot because these monsters are tough if your 
    levels are low, otherwise they are just pushovers. In the room to the 
    right of the save point is the DOUBLE CUT MATERIA, ESCORT GUARD, 
    CONFORMER, and a MEGAELIXIR. TO the left of the save point is Reno and 
    Rude of the turks, unless you have encountered them in the second trip to 
    the Shin-Ra tower in the train tunnels a fight will start. 

BOSS: Rude and Reno of the Turks HP: 24,000
    Not very tough each of them carries 12,000 HP and you can paralyze them

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

UNLIMITED SOURCES
    Well have you ever wondered is it possible to raise your stats after your 
    at level 99? Well me niether, but you can get unlimited sources by 
    morphing each creature into an item. There are six different creatures 
    aboard the Gelnika each of them morphs into a different source:

Bad Rap-LUCK SOURCE
Poodler-SPEED SOURCE
SERPENT-MIND SOURCE
Unknown-POWER SOURCE
Unknown2-GUARD SOURCE
Unknown3-MAGIC SOURCE

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

LUCKY 7 EFFECT
    When your HP is over 7,777 and an opponent or ally hits you and your HP 
    falls exactly on 7,777, the characters name will emit a Rainbow Glow and 
    goes berserk landing hits non-stop doing 7,777 damage each time until all 
    enemies are gone. After battle the party member who was effected by the 
    Lucky 7 Effect his or her HP will drop to 1.

=============================================================================

    the safe using this combination:

            Right-36, Left-10, Right-59, Right-97

Afterwards a boss fight will initiate.

BOSS: Loss Number HP: 7,000 Item: ODIN SUMMON MATERIA, COSMO MEMORY, SAFE KEY
    This boss is pretty easy if you came here either on the second DISC or 
    the third DISC. Just use CHOCO/MOG to paralyze it and pummel it or use 
    ULTIMA, COMET2, BAHAMUT ZERO, TYPOON, or FLARE once. One of these spells 
    should finish it off if your magic is high.

    Now go to the basement using the spiral staircase and go to the locked 
    door just before the library and enter it and you will encounter a man in 
    a coffin named Vincent. Tell him about Sephiroth and talk to him again 
    and he will just close his coffin. Enter the library and now leave and 
    before you hit the spiral staircase Vincent will approach you and join 
    your party.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

AQUIRING YUFFIE
    Before your first trip to Junon you should find a nearby forest and you 
    will fight Yuffie.

    You can aquire Yuffie anytime you want might I add.

BOSS: Mystery Ninja HP: Depends on Levels 
    Afterwards, Yuffie will be lying on the ground, and DO NOT USE THAT SAVE 
    POINT! That means Yuffie gets away! Inspect Yuffie and copy the following 
    dialogue:

Yuffie: "You Spikey Headed Jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!"
Cloud: Not interested.
Yuffie: "You're pretty scared of me huh!?"
Cloud: Petrified.
Yuffie: "I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!"
Cloud: Wait a Second!
Yuffie: "You want me to go with you?"
Cloud: ...That's right.
Yuffie: "All Right! I'll go with you!"
Cloud: ...Let's hurry on.

    That's it.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

SECRET ROOM IN COSMO CANYON
    In the Item Shop in Cosmo Canyon when the team first arrives the doorway 
    that looks a little like a window is cut off, but revisit this exact same 
    place later in the game and the doorway is now open. The items in the 
    room are ELIXIR, MAGIC SOURCE, and the FULL CURE MATERIA.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

KEY TO SECTOR 5
    In Bone Village you can find the KEY TO SECTOR 5 in the second or third 
    DISC around the tent, most likely infront of the tent's entrance. Tell 
    the Site Manager that you are looking for normal treasure. Afterwards you 
    can go back to Midgar and go to the Wall Market and visit the Item and 
    Weapon shops to pick up both the SNEAK GLOVE(129,000 Gil) and PREMIUM 
    HEART for Tifa.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

THE SIX FLYERS
    In Wutai, Turtle's Paradise is holding a contest and giving away prizes 
    for whoever can locate all the six flyers posted around the world. Start 
    looking in these places:

FLYER 2: Right next to Turtle's Paradise, in Yuffie's basement right next to 
         the trap room.
FLYER 3: The INN in Cosmo Canyon right next to the INN employee's front desk.
FLYER 4: The Weapon Shop in Cosmo Canyon, it is directly north of the save 
         point.
FLYER 5: In Midgar visit the boys house who had five gil in his drawer, check 
         to the left wall.
FLYER 6: You only have two chances during your visit and revisit to Shin-Ra 
         tower, check around the lobby.

    When you have found all six FLYERS go back to Turtle's Paradise to 
    recieve a POWER SOURCE, MIND SOURCE, MAGIC SOURCE, SPEED SOURCE, GUARD 
    SOURCE, LUCK SOURCE, and a MEGAELIXIR.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

WHY DID CLOUD BECOME A MERCENARY?
    After Cloud's encounter with the Lifestream go to the library in the 
    basement of Nibelheim. Here you will see that both Cloud and Zack 
    underwent the Mako treatment and Zack was the only one out of the two who 
    had took the Mako energy well enough. After Zack breaks free he also 
    frees Cloud and helps him escape, later they hitch a ride on the back of 
    a truck towards Midgar, on the ride Zack tells Cloud that he wants to 
    become a mercenary to make alot of money, but Cloud hears little as he is 
    still a little dizzy from the Mako energy. Just before they reach Midgar 
    Zack fights off some Shin-Ra troops but they overwhelm him and they shoot 
    Zack dead, the troops investigate Cloud and thought that Cloud was a 
    goner anyways. Cloud, still a little dizzy went over to his friend Zack 
    to see that if he was still breathing, but sadly Zack died defending 
    Cloud. The only way Cloud feels he can repay Zack is by becoming a 
    Mercenary like Zack wanted to be and by taking his sword and swear 
    revenge on Shin-Ra.

WUTAI
    You will need Yuffie for this next area(but you do not need her in your 
    party), otherwise it is just a regular town. Before you go anywhere I 
    suggest you get out a sheet of paper and write down the materia that is 
    equipped with each party member in the exact links and slots and keep the 
    sheet of paper after you are through with Wutai. The town of Wutai is on 
    the northern part of the most western island. You should come back here 
    after probably around the end of the second DISC, so that you are strong 
    enough to face off against the five Mighty Gods in the Pagoda. When you 
    come close to Wutai Yuffie will stop you but before she can finish Shin-
    Ra troops come after you. After you have defeated the troops, something 
    valuable is missing...YOUR MATERIA! Now head for Wutai and talk to the 
    town people and they will talk about Godo and his house in the north part 
    of Wutai. When your in the northern part of Wutai check the house to the 
    right and enter it and you will see Master Godo sleeping in his room, 
    talk to him serveral times and Yuffie will finally pop out of hiding. She 
    does not seem very happy and Godo chaces his daughter out of the house. 
    Along the right side of the house you will see a fake wall all the way to 
    the right of Godo's bedroom, check it to recieve Red XIII's HAIRPIN. Now 
    go to the Item Shop in southern Wutai and pick up the MP ABSORB MATERIA, 
    but before you put it in your pocket Yuffie comes down and snatches it 
    from you. Now go to the house that in to the right of the entrance of 
    Wutai and inside you will see a granfather and a boy, check the blind to 
    the left side of the room to scare Yuffie out of her hiding place. 
    Afterwards check the pot that is in front of Turtle's Paradise, the party 
    will seal off both bridges and Cloud will approach the pot, well what do 
    you know, it is Yuffie! Now she apologizes and she says she left all the 
    party's materia in her basement, she asks you to pull a lever, and it 
    does not matter which one you pull because they are both a trap, now 
    Yuffie has tricked you and you fell for it! She runs off, but first you 
    must free your other party members. Now head to the northern part of 
    Wutai and to the left house you will see that the gate that was 
    previously locked is now unlocked, but how to get in...wait! I have it, 
    bang the gong to open the door to Yuffie's hideout and inside you will 
    learn that the girl crazy, overweight Corneo is back and this time he has 
    captured both Elena of the Turks and Yuffie, but before you can do a 
    thing you will engage in a fight against some Shin-Ra attack squads. 
    Afterwards go to the southern part of Wutai and you will walk into Reno 
    and Rude of the Turks, do not worry because you will not have to fight 
    them this time, but they tell you that Corneo is hiding in the Da-Chao 
    mountains. Now go Da-Chao located in the back of southern Wutai and find 
    Corneo. When you find Corneo he has strapped both Elena and Yuffie to the 
    side of the Da-Chao statues, but before you can resue them have Barret 
    switch his LIMIT BREAK to Level 1. You will engage in a battle against 
    Rapps, Corneo's ugly pet.

BOSS: Rapps HP: 6,000 Item: Peace Ring
    Have Barret use his MIND BLOW to knock out 100 MP from Rapps so that he 
    does not use his AERO3 attack that can cause up 1,400 HP of damage to a 
    single character. Then pummel him and use your LIMIT BREAKS as they come 
    up. This boss is a little tough, but with quick blows and having lots of 
    HI-POTIONS, this should be a pretty easy fight.

    Afterwards Corneo is not about to play fair but Reno comes in and drops 
    Corneo to the mountains below. Now that you have your Materia back you 
    can save, but your MAteria is all out of order, so if you have that sheet 
    of paper I told you about earlier you will be fine. Now put Yuffie in 
    your party and you might want to visit the Cat House that is on the top 
    right corner of southern Wutai. Give Yuffie your strongest Materia and 
    head for the Pagoda to face off against the five mighty gods. 

    When you reach the pagoda you will first face off with Gorki.

BOSS: Gorki HP: 4,000 Item: X-POTION
    Watch out when he uses DEMI2, but you can instantly beat him with either 
    ULITMA or COMET2.

    Next continue up the pagoda and onto the next fight, heal if you were 
    weak from the last battle, if you so happen to lose, do not worry, you 
    can try again.

BOSS: Shake HP: 5,000 Item: TURBO ETHER
    You can paralyze it if you want with the CHOCO/MOG SUMMON MATERIA, but 
    when you have BAHAMUT ZERO in your possesion, why would you wanna waste 
    your time? Just use any strong spell once and he should be toast. Just 
    watch out when he does his Rage Bomber attack that causes up to 600 HP of 
    damage.

    Continue up the pagoda and enter the next battle. And heal if your life 
    is low.

BOSS: Chekhov HP: 6,000 Item: ICE RING
    This guy is real easy to beat, just use any strong spell to knock him out 
    like BAHAMUT ZERO, ULTIMA, COMET2, or FLARE. Sometimes he can stun you 
    with his Stare Down attack but having the RIBBON equipped makes it 
    impossible.

    Continue up the pagoda and enter the next battle. And heal if your life 
    is low.

BOSS: Staniv HP: 6,000 ITEM: ELIXIR
    Just pummel this guy to bits with your regularr attacks if you want, 
    otherwise use a strong spell to kock him out quick because all he does is 
    use his War Cry attack which cause SADNESS.

    Continue up the pagoda and enter the next battle. And heal if your life 
    is low. But wait, Yuffie's father is the might god of the pagoda? Yuffie 
    will have a hard time with this next battle.

BOSS: Godo HP: 18,000 Item: LEVIATHAN SUMMON MATERIA and ALL CREATION 
    Okay he is a little easy since your levels are high. Use either BREAK, 
    FREEZE, TORNADO, FLARE, ULITMA, COMET2, or BAHAMUT ZERO with every chance 
    you get. But when the battle starts you might wanna start the battle off 
    by casting REGEN on yourself. After three or four rounds he should be 
    defeated.

    Afterwards you should get the LEVIATHAN SUMMON MATERIA and the LEVEL 4 
    LIMIT BREAK ALL CREATION. That is basically it, there is nothing else to 
    do here.

DA-CHAO FIRE CAVE
    When you try to find Corneo you might have bumped into a cave that is 
    blocked off by intense fire, if you have picked up the LEVIATHAN SCALES 
    in the Underwater Reactor then you can use them here to put out the fires 
    and collect both the ORITSURU for Yuffie and the STEAL AS WELL MATERIA.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

MASTERED MATERIA
    Remember when you went to store the HUGE MATERIA in Bugenhagen's 
    planetarium? Well if you have mastered materia you can mold it to form 
    one materia that does not affect your stats like magic and summon materia 
    would. Here is the materia you must master in certain categories if you 
    want a master materia for that group:

RED SUMMON MATERIA: MASTER SUMMON
CHOCO/MOG 
SHIVA
IFRIT
RAMUH
TITAN
LEVIATHAN
ODIN
BAHAMUT
KJATA
ALEXANDER
NEO BAHAMUT
PHEONIX
HADES
BAHAMUT ZERO
TYPOON
KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND

GREEN MAGIC MATERIA: MASTER MAGIC
BARRIER
COMET
CONTAIN
DESTRUCT
EARTH
EXIT
FIRE
FULLCURE
GRAVITY
HEAL
ICE
LIGHTNING
MYSTIFY

SHIELD
TIME
TRANSFORM
ULITMA

YELLOW COMMAND MATERIA: MASTER COMMAND
DEATHBLOW
MANIPULATE
MIME
MORPH

STEAL 
THROW

    ONCE you have mastered each one of these they can be molded into one, and 
    you can summon monsters unlimitedly.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


ANCIENT FOREST
    You can only get here if you have a Mountain Chocobo or better or if you 
    have defeated the ULTIMA WEAPON. When you enter here take the first three 
    insects and place each one of them in a Pitcher Flowers(the pods behind 
    the bridge). Then quickly use the small hill to the left and use the 
    Pitcher Flowers(who are now eating the flies) as platforms and hop 
    across. You can get the item on the Mutant Flytrap if you just barely 
    step on the plant and if you do so you will recieve the SUPERSHOT ST. Now 
    in the next area you must pick up an insect and reach the highest ledge 
    and put the insect to the left side of the Pitcher Flower so that it 
    jumps into the Pitcher Flower. Quickly let a frog eat an insect and place 
    it in the next flower pitcher and wait a while until Cloud will be 
    launched to the other side. Now pick up the Beehive and put it in the 
    Mutant Flytrap and it will shut automatically and then you can collect 
    the SLASH ALL MATERIA and also do not forget the treasure box's location
    (the treasure box that is unaccesible right now). Now put the frog back 
    in the right Flower Pitcher and wait a while and he will be flung towards 
    the next area. In this area put the two insects in the pitcher flowers 
    and Cloud should be able to reach the springy stamen which brings him up 
    above the Forest floor and into the high canopy and wal all the way to 
    the right and pick up the TYPOON MATERIA. Now go back all the way to the 
    left side of the Ancient Forest and Cloud will climb down a limb so he 
    can reach the previously inaccessible treasure box which contains a 
    MINERVA BAND. And go back to the area before you had gotten the TYPOON 
    SUMMON MATERIA. Now put an insect in the Pitcher Flower and pick up the 
    beehive after you have used the Pitcher Flower as a platform. Put the 
    Beehive in the Mutant Flytrap. Now pick use the other insect and put it 
    in the Pitcher Flower. Grab the other insect and put it in front of a 
    forest tree(the tree with a hole in it) to lure out a frog. Now leave the 
    frog alone and put it in the pitcher flower and then grab the frog and 
    put it in the Pitcher Flower and you will be propelled to the next area. 
    In this area is only a cave, the APOCALYPSE and an ELIXIR is all that is 
    in here. Once you exit through the top part of the cave, you will have to 
    go through everything again incase you decide to come back here on any 
    item you have missed.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

MORE GIL AND EXPIEREINCE POINTS
    There are two very special materia in the game that can increase the 
    amount of GIL and Expierience Points you gain and you can only get it if 
    you have enough GP at Gold Saucer. There is a lady standing inside the 
    entrance of Wonder Square and she will ask you to exchange your GP for 
    some prizes. There are two prizes labeled with "????????" one of them 
    cost 1000 GP and the other 2000:

1000 GP: GIL PLUS MATERIA
2000 GP: EXPERIENCE PLUS MATERIA

    With these you can double the amount of GIL and EXPERIENCE gained from 
    battle, but you cannot pair two of them up in the same person and get 
    four times the amount of GIL and EXPERIENCE gained though.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

AMERICAN WEAPONS
    All I can say is that you will need all the Master Materia and levels you 
    can get to beat these guys except for the ULTIMATE WEAPON and DIAMOND 
    WEAPON of course.

    During your trip back to Midgar on the second DISC you will encounter the 
    DIAMOND WEAPON coming from sea.

BOSS: DIAMOND WEAPON HP: 45,000 
    Ouch! You finally get to fight one of the weapons and I hope your levels 
    and materias are high enough. First off the basics, cast REGEN and WALL 
    on the entire party. Then cast HASTE but make sure you either have a 
    RIBBON equipped or if you have about ten ECHO SCREENs. Hit this guy with 
    everything you've got and it will still be standing. Your physical 
    attacks will do nothing against him so its a good idea to have a weapon 
    equipped with alot of materia slots, about 6-8 slots should do. Use 
    ULTIMA, BAHAMUT ZERO, COMET2 just any of your strong spells and that 
    includes FIRE3 or ICE3 or LIGHTNING3. I'm not sure if DEMI works but its 
    worth a shot. You can also steal the RISING SUN from him which has a 
    quadruple Materia growth in the Japan version but a double Materia growth 
    in the U.S. version. When the DIAMOND WEAPON counts down to one it will 
    do the DIAMOND FLASH attack which will do 2500-3200 HP of damage to every 
    character so watch out and keep plenty of PHEONIX downs or have a PHEONIX 
    SUMMON or a LIFE or LIFE2 spell. DIAMOND WEAPON's basic attack can cause 
    about 500-1000 HP of damage but REGEN should easily counter that.

    The other WEAPON is the ULTIMATE WEAPON which is not so tough.

BOSS: ULTIMATE WEAPON 40,000 Item: Ultima Weapon
    Here just start the battle off by using BAHAMUT ZERO and he should fly 
    off. You only have to lose him 8,000 HP anyways. But probably not before 
    the ULIMATE WEAPON has used the SHADOW FLARE on one of your party members 
    which causes up to 9,000 HP of damage. 

    When he flies off revive the party member to full if he or she is 
    wounded. Now go search either Nibelheim, Midgar, Mideel, or Cosmo Canyon. 
    After you have repeated the same steps just keep doing this until he 
    stops at Cosmo Canyon, right in front of the Ancient Forest. Afterwards 
    Cloud will get the ULTIMA WEAPON which is the strongest weapon in the 
    game and can easily deal 9,999 HP of damage with each hit.

    Here is where the stakes get high, both the RUBY WEAPON and the EMERALD 
    WEAPON are equally tough and very hard to beat, but if you follow these 
    steps and have the required items and levels, then you should be able to 
    beat them. First you must get the FINAL ATTACK MATERIA at the Battle 
    Arena, you do this by collecting both OMNISLASH and the W-SUMMON MATERIA. 
    Afterwards talk to the lady again and have Cloud equipped with his 
    ULTIMATE WEAPON and take the special battle and after seven battles you 
    face off against the suped up version of Proud Clod and if you beat him 
    you will recieve the FINAL ATTACK MATERIA and that is the only thing you 
    should fight the special battle for. Next You must also morph a guide 
    book from the Ghost Ship in the underwater reactor and give it to the 
    Kalm Traveler in Kalm and after you have recieved the UNDERWATER MATERIA 
    equip it on anyone of of your party members that will help fight the 
    EMERALD WEAPON. Also pack your party members down with HP PLUS and MP 
    PLUS MATERIA so that they have 999 MP and 9,999 HP. You can find the 
    EMERALD WEAPON in the ocean by using your submarine, it should be 
    wandering around somewhere, so just bump your submarine into it to 
    initiate the fight.

Items or status suggested/required:
    ALL PARTY MEMBERS AT LEVEL 90 OR HIGHER
    KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND SUMMON MATERIA AT LEVEL 2 OR HIGHER
    W-SUMMON MATERIA
    MASTER MAGIC
    MIME
    BIG GUARD ENEMY SKILL
    MYSTILE
    UNDERWATER MATERIA
    MASTERED PHEONIX SUMMON MATERIA(link with mastered FINAL ATTACK MATERIA)
    MASTERED FINAL ATTACK MATERIA(link with Mastered PHEONIX MATERIA)
    MASTERED REVIVE MATERIA(optional)
    OMNISLASH
    HIGHWIND
    CATASTROPHE
    MASTERED DOUBLE CUT MATERIA
    ULTIMATE WEAPONS(optional)

BOSS: EMERALD WEAPON HP: 1,900,000 Item: Earth Harp
    Hopefully you have the UNDERWATER materia equipped on either party member     
    to eliminate the twenty minute time mark, making the fight easier. Well 
    you can start the battle off by casting KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND twice with 
    the W-SUMMON MATERIA and have your party MIME it, afterwards have your 
    party members attack with DEMI which will cause 9,999 damage until he 
    almost dies of course. Have another party cast BIG GUARD and put all 
    Magic users in the back and have the attacker hit with the 4X-CUT
    (basically Cloud) using his APOCALYPSE sword(if you want to triple your 
    Ability Points, but if you want to deal 9,999 Damage you can equip him 
    with his ULTIMA WEAPON). Next have someone cast REGEN and BIG GUARD on 
    the entire party. Now keep attacking with DEMI and Cloud's regular 
    attacks, but if you want you can MIME Cloud's 4X-CUT attack dealing alot 
    of damage. When the smaller EMERALDS come out quickly knock them out 
    because they can hit you with four consecutive attacks before you can do 
    a thing about it. Two EMERALDs drain 300-700 MP while the other two drain 
    1500-4000 HP. Each EMERALD has 20,000 HP so knock them out quickly by 
    having a party member either cast KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND once or casting 
    BAHAMUT ZERO twice and MIME it the other party members. This guy can 
    attack hard and fast, but without his EMERALDs, he just another pushover. 
    The EMRALD WEAPON can attack with the TET-RAM STORM which will deal 9,999 
    Damage to every party member, so having the linked and Mastered SUMMON 
    PHEONIX MATERIA and FINAL ATTACK MATERIA should bring your party members 
    back to life, but you must have at least 180 MP before the EMERALD WEAPON 
    kills you otherwise you can not cast the PHEONIX and therefore you will 
    die and cannot come back. The EMERALD WEAPON can only attack with its 
    super weapon if one of the EMERALDS are still active. Continue to pummel 
    him away with the repeating steps but I suggest you have Cid, Barret, and 
    Cloud in your group because their LIMIT BREAKS cause massive damage and 
    the EMERALD WEAPON's attack can easily build up their guages with one 
    hit. So keep repeating the process and you can obtain: 

    Experience Points: 50,000 Ability Points: 50,000 Item: Earth Harp

    If Cloud has his APOCALYPSE sword any materia contained in it will 
    recieve 150,000 Ability Points! The same goes for the SCIMTAR! Now go use 
    a TENT and save your game outside and go to the desert you went to 
    earlier(with Corel Prison in the middle of the desert) and move the 
    Highwind or a Gold Chocobo into the beast to initiate the fight. But 
    before you fight take the time to equip one party member with the 
    following:

    FINAL ATTACK-REVIVE MATERIA COMBINATION(both mastered)
    MASTER SUMMON
    W-SUMMON MATERIA
    MYSTILE(armor)
    ENEMY SKILL MATERIA(to cast BIG GUARD)
    MASTER MAGIC
    RIBBON(accessory)

    Afterwards kill the other two party members before fighting the RUBY 
    WEAPON and move that character to the front row and make sure to pack 
    them down with HP PLUS and MP PLUS MATERIA so that they have 999 MP and 
    9,999 HP.

BOSS: RUBY WEAPON HP: 1,050,000 Item: Desert Rose
    First wait for the RUBY WEAPON to put its claws in the sand and use 
    KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND twice with the W-SUMMON. If you have three alive 
    members in your party the RUBY WEAPON will use his Whirlsand Attack which 
    sucks the party member into the sand making him or her unavailable to use 
    for the entire battle and he will use this attack twice making the battle 
    extremely tough, that is why you must kill the other party members you do 
    not want to fight RUBY WEAPON, in a random encounter around Gold Saucer. 
    After that RUBY WEAPON will counter with ULTIMA, but if you have the 
    MYSTILE you will easily dodge the magic attack. Afterwards set up BIG 
    GUARD and then HASTE and use a TURBO ETHER to restore your MP. The RUBY 
    WEAPON has three parts, Body, Claw1, and Claw2. The body has super 
    defense meaning all Magic and Physical attacks cause one tenth the normal 
    damage except for KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND SUMMON MATERIA, TYPOON SUMMON 
    MATERIA, and BAHAMUT ZERO SUMMON MATERIA. The Claw1 which is the Claw on 
    the left drains your MP by up 600, and the Claw2 can damage you with a 
    single attack that does up to 9500 HP of damage but if you are put in the 
    front row and have the BIG GUARD on then damage will be cut down to a 
    third of the regular damage. The Claw have 150,000 HP each and can be 
    revived over and over again, once you destroy the body the whole creature 
    dies. Watch out for the Ruby Flame attack which is incredibly powerful 
    that can cause up to 8,500 HP of damage to you and not to mention hitting 
    you with every single status effect in the book, but having the RIBBON on 
    can easily counter that and it has a COMET2 spell which is very powerful 
    and can most likely leave you with very little HP, but having the MYSTILE 
    equipped means that you can dodge at least two of the Comets that hit you 
    or maybe all four. Once you are revived just repeat with W-SUMMON KNIGHTS 
    OF THE ROUND ATTACK until he dies, but make sure your MP is above 100 so 
    that you can cast LIFE2 before you die, do not combine the PHEONIX SUMMON 
    MATERIA with the FINAL ATTACK MATERIA which will bring all your party 
    members back to life and that makes the RUBY WEAPON use his Whirlsand 
    attack and the possibility of taking your main character out of the 
    battle. Keep repeating the process and you can gain:

         EXPERIENCE POINTS: 45,000 ABILITY POINTS: 50,000

    So if you used your APOCALYPSE sword in the battle against EMERALD WEAPON 
    and you have used your APOCALYPSE sword in this battle you can gain 
    300,000 Ability Points for KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND SUMMON MATERIA leaving 
    you with 200,000 left to go, which is a long way but still! After the 
    battle you recieve the DESERT ROSE which is basically a useless item.

    Now take both the DESERT ROSE and the EARTH HARP to the Kalm Traveler in 
    the right house in Kalm and with the EARTH HARP you can recieve a three 
    piece set of Mastered Materia which are the MASTER COMMAND, MASTER 
    SUMMON, and MASTER MAGIC. Give your DESERT ROSE to the Kalm Traveler and 
    he will give you basically a useless prize which is a GOLD CHOCOBO, well 
    why is it useless? Well you have already gotten KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND 
    SUMMON MATERIA right?


=============================================================================
=============================================================================

CHOCOBO BREEDING
    First off you will need at least two million Gil if you want a gold 
    chocobo and you will endure a long process that takes days to complete. 
    Buy at least four Chocobo Ranches for 10,000 Gil each by speaking to 
    Chocobo Bill. Now have your CHOCOBO LURE MATERIA equipped and capture a 
    good and average chocobo. If you have done so send them back to the Ranch 
    and to tell if you have got a good and average chocobo:

Good: "Mmm, this one's not bad"
Average: "This is a pretty average chocobo"

    That is all you should hear to see that you got the right chocobos and 
    make sure one of them is a male and the other one is a female. Now go to 
    the Chocobo Sage in the mountains up north that is directly north above 
    Bone Village. Inside you will see a Green Chocobo talk to it and it will 
    drop an ENEMY SKILL MATERIA. Now talk to the guy on the top who is the 
    Chocobo sage and he wil tell you about Chocobos, afterwards buy as much 
    SYLKIS GREENS as you can. Go back to the ranch and feed your chocobos by 
    talking to Chocobo Billy, try to spread out your Greens to both the 
    chocobos, try to max out their stats for the long term better result. 
    After you have maxed out their statistics race them at the Chocobo Race 
    in Gold Saucer. During the race you can leave your Chocobo on Automatic 
    control as he sails by Class-C. After winning three races(does not have 
    to be won consecutively) you are moved to Class-B. Just let your chocobo 
    run on Automatic and if he or she does not win then run them on Manual. 
    After you have won three races you have moved up a rank which is the 
    Class-A. You do not need to proceed any further. Do the same for your 
    other Chocobo, so now you should have two Class-A chocobos. NOTE: 
    Occasionally Cid or Tifa(mostly Cid) will ask to ride a chocobo if they 
    are in your party, this does not change a thing, not even the prizes won 
    it is your choice if you choose to let him or her ride or not. Afterwards 
    go to a small island forest that is directly north of the Chocobo Ranch 
    and steal a ZEIO NUT from the Goblins. Return to the Chocobo Ranch and 
    have your two chocobos mate with one another and feed them a ZEIO NUT. In 
    the morning you should either have a RIVER CHOCOBO(blue) or a MOUNTAIN 
    CHOCOBO(green), if not just try again. It does not matter which one you 
    get, but for the easiest way to reach the ultimate chocobo follow the 
    steps below:

MOUNTAIN CHOCOBO-
    Two Class-A chocobos mate with a ZEIO NUT.

RIVER CHOCOBO-
    Two Class-A chocobos mate with a ZEIO NUT. NOTE: After you have either 
    Chocobo do something for ten minutes in the game and come back and have 
    the save parents mate again to get the other chocobo and make sure you 
    have one Male Blue or Green Chocobo and a Female Blue or Green Chocobo, 
    keep trying until you have both.

BLACK CHOCOBO-
    Have one Male Blue or Green Chocobo mate with a Female Blue or Green 
    Chocobo(both chocobos must be Class-A or higher) and feed them a ZEIO 
    NUT.

GOLD CHOCOBO-
    Have a regular Class-A chocobo(male or female) mate with a Class-S Black 
    Chocobo and feed them a CAROB NUT which can be stolen from the Vlakorados 
    near the plain area around Bone Village.

    That's all you need to have your Ulitmate Chocobo, and each time a new 
    offspring is born their parents statistics are passed down so do not 
    worry about feeding them 100 SYLKIS GREENS again, but the offspring can 
    be fed more greens to max out greater statistics.

    Now with your new chocobo you can reach all four normally impossible to 
    reach materias:

MIME COMMAND MATERIA-
    There is a mountain cave southeast of Wutai which can be reached by a 
    Green Chocobo or a Gold Chocobo.

QUADRA MAGIC SUPPORT MATERIA-
    Just north of Mideel Island and southeast of the Chocobo Ranch you will 
    find a cave surrounded by shallow water on the lower part of the island. 
    Have a Blue or Gold Chocobo ride off the coast east of the Chocobo Ranch 
    and walk along the shallow water and find your entrance to the cave.

HP<-->MP MATERIA-
    Directly north of Nibel Mountains have a Black or Gold Chocobo reach 
    across a small river and into a cave that is surrounded by brown rocks 
    and a small river(which is the one you have crossed).

KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND SUMMON MATERIA-
    Take your Gold chocobo and head to the northeast corner of the World Map 
    and find an island that has a forest in the middle of the island 
    surrounded my mountain ranges and into the cave. 

NOTE: This island is not located on the World Map.

-----------------------------[ MATERIA LISTING ]-----------------------------
=============================================================================

    Materia is practically the whole basis of this game, without it there 
    probably would be no storyline. As you all know that once a piece of 
    materia is mastered a new duplicated materia is born which you can master 
    over again and so on. Below is practically all the materia in the game 
    but if I am missing something please tell me.

--------------------[ Final Fantasy games Review Index ]---------------------
=============================================================================

    Well here is the section where I rate all the Final Fantasy games or 
    those that are carrying the Final Fantasy name.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy: 20 out of 10 Platform: NES
    This is the game that started it all. You are the chosen four LIGHT 
    WARRIORs chosen to protect the Earth from Chaos and Destruction. 
    Fortunately a mysterious force is causing the Earth to rot, the Wind to 
    stop, the Fire to cool, and the water to dissappear. As the chosen four 
    light warrior move towards Corneria Castle they cannot predict what comes 
    next.

    This is probably one of the top 5 games of all time, it had a nice 
    storyline, very long gameplay, and a nice plot. The music in this game is 
    too remarkable, that you will just play the game to listen to the game's 
    catchy music. There are alot of puzzles in this game and each event you 
    do opens two more doors until the very end. 

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 2: 18 out of 10 Platform: Famicom
    Can this can be as good as its predessor? Four Warriors, each with a good 
    natured soul, but with parents that were brutally killed in the castle of 
    Fuun. The Empire of Baramekia have called monsters from a far off place 
    in hopes of ruling the world. The castle of Puun is now taken and the now 
    four orphan warriors must find a way to sustain peace and no matter the 
    cost.

    I have only played the game for an hour and this game is almost as good 
    as its predessor with excellent soundtrack and excellent storyline, the 
    towns in this game very redone with excellent detail. The battle is music 
    is a little catchy also, but the gameplay is what sets the game apart. 
    This game had everything the first one did but I like the storyline in 
    the first one better.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 3: ? Platform: Famicom
NEVER PLAYED IT.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 4(U.S. Final Fantasy 2): 20 out of 20 Platform: SNES and SFAM
    The first game for the new 16-bit system and how did it fare out? 
    Monsters appear more by the day, people being killed by night, and Cecil 
    the Dark Knight of Baron can only wonder why he has taken so much from 
    the innocent people of Mysidia. As he returns the crystal to the King of 
    Baron he questions the kings orders and now has been thrown out of rank. 
    Now Cecil and the Dragoon Knight Kain lead off towards a battle that can 
    save the world.

    The graphics really hasn't changed much from Final Fantasy 3, they have 
    only been more colorful. The storyline in this game undergoes a massive 
    Automated storyline meaning an event just takes place without you having 
    to push the "A" button. This game is really neat and interesting due to 
    the fact that you do not find out who the real mastermind is until the 
    bitter end, and no it is not Golbez. The music in this game has taken 
    a lot more liveliness making the music better than ever. 

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 4H: 22 out of 20 Platform: FAM
    Well this is the hard version of the game and its amazing what they have 
    taken from the game in the U.S. Where are these monsters coming from? Why 
    is it that Cecil, the Dark Knight of Baron perform such cruel acts to 
    innocent people? Now the Dark Knight Cecil and the Dragoon Knight Kain 
    set off into a boundary that's far more dangerous than the two has 
    imagined.

    This game really stays to the same plot as the other one but alot of 
    spells and abilities were in this one like Cecil's DragonWave attack, or 
    the fact that a Ring was being carried to the town of Myst and not a 
    package. The same storyline is hear with the same memorable music but 
    some of the things in this game were a little different. But overall this 
    game was very unique and harder since the fact that all the hidden 
    passages have been covered up.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 5: 30 out of 10 Platform: FAM
    This is my favorite game ever! It has a little bit of the same storyline 
    has Final Fantasy but this game was alot different. The Wind stops and 
    fire corrupts in haywire. The King of Tycoon fly off to see what is wrong 
    with the Wind Crystal, suddenly after the King leaves a Meteorite hits 
    the castle as Lenna falls to the ground below. Butz, a traveler that 
    always along side his best chocobo Boco wander to see what was the mishap 
    as he finds a young lady injured and an old man showing signs of memory 
    loss. Why is there so many Meteorites fallen lately, what is happening 
    with the Crystals of the Earth? As Butz goes off he does not realize he 
    is part of the key to stopping the catastrophes.

    Basically a well maintained game with fabulous music and probably the 
    best plot I have seen. This game is very long and the storyline really 
    packs a punch to the entire plot and you will be hooked on this game for 
    weeks without stopping. This game has alot of mysteries and solving each 
    mystery leaves another mystery waiting to be solved. Truely the best game 
    ever in my opinion.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 6(U.S. Final Fantasy 3): 19 out of 10 Platform: SNES and SFAM
    Many consider this game to be the best Final Fantasy and alot better than 
    Final Fantasy 7, do you agree? In a time long ago, the War of the Magi 
    had erupted a 1000 years ago between the humans and the espers. Humans 
    were corruptive and wanted the Espers' powers but the humans were to 
    strong and powerful forcing the Espers to flee across a gate. A thousand 
    years later an evil empire is ruled by the villanous Emperor Ghestal and 
    his valiant servant, Kefka. The empire wants the powers of the Espers and 
    they have done many cruel things to get there way. Terra Branford, part 
    esper and part human is being controled by the Empire to do their evil 
    biddings and later she is finally released from her mind hold. Now that 
    she is free, what will she do? The world is about to fall apart and 
    unless she does something about it there will be no world.

    This game is better than Final Fantasy 7, in my opinion and the game 
    takes so long to complete. One of the most memorable music in this game   
    in my opinion is the boss music. The music in this game goes so well with 
    each event its like magic almost. The graphics in this game are really 
    well done and to me they look better than Final Fantasy 7's, in a matter 
    of opinion. This game was very well made and the storyline is just 
    undescribable. The plot all goes in order with the game unlike Final 
    Fantasy 7 and all in all this was one of the best games and can honestly 
    be in one of the top 5 of all time.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy 7: 7 out of 10 Platform: PSX
    With high technolgy and powerful magic, two elements combine in a world 
    like never before. You are Cloud, the Soldier that was put under the 
    influence of Jenova cells who has been chosen by destiny to save the 
    world from both Shinra's earth energy draining power plants and 
    Sephiroth's Meteor. With the help of your new found friends can you save 
    the world from destruction?

    Well thanks to all those people who have cleared me up on those 
    questions. At first I was a little puzzled on some questions, but still 
    one questions me:

    Why does those vehicles like the Buggy or Tiny Bronco just dissappeared 
    off the map?

    Overall this game was pretty good, but compared to the storylines of 
    other Final Fantasy games I just didn't like this one as the others. I 
    mean sure the story with Cloud and Spehiroth was great, but FF6 had depth 
    and went into all of the 16 characters' backgrounds, FF5 had personality 
    where you would see Faris one day as the leader of a pirate gang and the 
    other day a beautiful princess. But overall FF7 didn't dissappoint, and I 
    did enjoy playing every minute of it.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Mystic Quest: 6 out of 10 Platform: SNES and SFAM
    Well I have played this game for a while and quickly turned it off, 
    apparently this game has no initial plot and the game was meant for 
    beginners, so that is probably why it has such a low rating.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Legends: 10 out of 10 Platform: GB
    Well this is not part of the Final Fantasy series but since it carries 
    the name I might as well play the game and review it. All through the 
    world the news has spread about Queen Asura's treachery. She is the one 
    who is destroying paradise which is at the top of a giant tower. What 
    wonderful place that can be called paradise lies at the top of the tower? 
    Many have said the the tower leads to other worlds and even to a world of 
    water! Some say it can lead you to the future where magic becomes 
    obsolete and high technology is the way to cruise. But the people who 
    have traveled through the tower have never came back, it is because they 
    have found the true paradise at the top of the tower? Or is it because 
    they were killed by the monsters in the tower? Battle your way through 
    worlds of: Land, Water, Space, and Future city in a non-stop adventure. 
    Because what really lies up top of the tower is...

    Well all I can say was this game is different, but not too different that 
    will cause you not to like it. In this game the enemies give away alot of 
    gold but no experience, so how is one to gain levels? Well you do not 
    gain it you buy it! Also weapons in the game are limited to a certain 
    amount of uses, sorta like your buying darts to throw. Some weapons in 
    the game can be used unlimitedly. This also goes the same for shields, 
    but helmets, armor, and gloves can be used unlimitedly. Also in this game 
    you can save wherever you want at anytime, even when you are standing 
    next to a boss! Well overall this game was unique but was very fustrating 
    due to the fact that a certain robot that did 594 DMG to every character 
    when your HP was around 300. 

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Legends 2: 12 out of 10 Platform: GB
    Well Legends was good but how about the next one? A long time ago ancient 
    gods possessed a powerful entity called the Magi. But the Magi was too 
    powerful so the gods has separated the entity into 77 pieces, yes that's 
    right 77. You have been given one of those pieces. It is your job to find 
    all 77 pieces before anyone else does and you must find your father. A 
    tower leads you through to guide you through all 77 pieces as each piece 
    is lying about. Search for these pieces and restore the power of the Magi 
    and protect it.

    This game did not improve much from the last one like it still has buying 
    limited use weapons and enybody can equip any armor and also the fact 
    that it still stuck with you choosing from a human, mutant, or a monster 
    in your party. The only thing is, is that you gain experience from 
    fighting battles, but there is no status screen for you to see how much 
    you need to reach the next level. But the storyline is practically 
    flawless and the music is as enjoyable as all the other Final Fantasy 
    games. Overall this game had an excellent plot and excellent game play.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Legends 3: 15 out of 10 Platform: GB
    A thousand years ago a war had started to gain control of the Idyllic 
    world called Pureland. People say that "he who gains this power, gains 
    our souls" and that is why the warriors must protect it. The fierce 
    warriors of the Pureland entity were locked away in this war but by the 
    means of a highly powerful space craft which has been given to you. The 
    greedy people that were locked away by the Talon has broken free of their 
    hold and the entity is consuming all life that touches it, it is now up 
    to you to stop it.

    All I can say is that this has got to be one of the best games yet for 
    the gameboy. The storyline goes into the automatated sequence that Final 
    Fantasy 4 went through and this time you are given a status screen so you 
    earn your levels instead of buying them like you did in Final Fantasy 
    Legends. The storyline also has a good plot and the gameplay is one of 
    the longest I have seen. The music in this game is not bad either as well 
    as the graphics which are pretty good for an 8-bit system, but then again 
    who said graphics was a game anyways?

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Tactics: 5 out of 10 Platform: PSX
    Well I really did not like this game much, sure I like strategy games but 
    this game, each battle was extremely time consuming like probably twenty 
    minutes of your time. Probably the best Strategy game in my opinion was 
    REALM, which was one of the most oldest and most addictive strategy games 
    I have ever played.

=============================================================================

Final Fantasy Adventure: ? Platform: GB
    Never played it.

=============================================================================
