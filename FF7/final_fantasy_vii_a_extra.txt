A quick note from KM:

Hello!  No, this isn't another update, it's more like a quick addition
I'm putting here so that everyone will notice it.  I'm asking that you
guys DON'T E-MAIL ME ABOUT FF7 QUESTIONS anymore.  I've answered so
many e-mails I can't possibly count them all, and even though I stopped
the US FF7 FAQ back in January, people still e-mail me constantly, and
I don't have the time to answer it all.  If you want to use my FF7 FAQ
on a web page, go ahead.  If you want to use this FAQ in any other way
(such as in a publication or there is some sort of legal or credit
issue,) then you MUST contact me first, but otherwise, that's it!  You
can't please everyone, which is a big reason why the FAQ won't be
updated anymore!

I'm not trying to be rude, but it gets a little tiring at times.  I
realize that there are some mistakes still in the FAQ that I never got
around to correcting (the Emerald Weapon does damage equal to the
materia that you wear, there is no use for the miniature soldiers, you
cannot have chocobos that can fly, and any character who isn't in Disc
2 or 3 cannot be used without a GameShark code, and Bahamut Zero can be
gotten from Cosmo Canyon, this is in the FAQ but no one notices [ditto
with info. on how to get the Underwater Materia in the US version!]),
but I've done this thing for more than a year now and I'm tired of FF7,
geez!  Besides, those of you who keep up on the legal side of things
know that I have other reasons for not wanting to continue the FAQ....
Anyway, if you _do_ send me a question, your mail will be erased!  I
hate to end the FAQ on this sort of note, but that's how it is.

(Please note that this is the last revision of the Japanese FF7 FAQ.
If you own a US copy of FF7, I have an English FAQ that you can find
at most Final Fantasy-related sites, including my own homepage at:
<http://www.fortunecity.com/bally/orange/25/>.  I've had a lot of
fun working on this guide and I appreciate everyone who contributed,
but at this point, there's not much of a reason to continue this
version of the FAQ now that the English release of FF7 is available.)


This FAQ is divided into two parts:

The Complete Walkthrough    - You're not reading this file.  It contains
                              a guide for the entire game, and has
                              information on how to play the game.

Extra Stuff You Should Know - The file you're reading now.  This file
                              focuses on secrets in the game.  In
                              addition it has extensive lists of materia
                              orbs, limit breaks, monsters and
                              speculation concerning FF7 rumors.

Both of these files can be found at the 'main' address (cgfm2's homepage)
Other sites that carry this FAQ may not have both files, or may have
older versions of the FAQ (it was just one file until v1.6).  If you're
asking why I split up this FAQ, it's because it was too big for me to
edit on my computer.... ^_^;  Both parts will be updated under the same
revision number--you can find out which file was updated by looking
under the 'Revision History' section.  Some sections can be found in
both files, simply for ease of use and to create a more uniform
appearance.

                          ++++++++++++++++++++++

VERSION 2.2  (November 12, 1997)
Minor corrections and URL changes.  Just a reminder that this is
the last revision of the FAQ, and that you should download my US
FF7 FAQ if you need help in the game.

VERSION 2.1  (August 19, 1997)
Stuck the disclaimer back in part 1 of the FAQ, and made a few
touch-ups.

VERSION 2.0  (August 10th, 1997)
More minor corrections.  I think now I have everything covered :)

VERSION 1.8  (August 8th, 1997)
Added information Yuffie stealing 'disabled' materia, and made
various corrections I forgot to add to v1.7 ^_^;

VERSION 1.7  (August 4th, 1997)
The Disc Two and Three Walkthroughs have been entirely re-written,
and are now in English.  In addition, the Monster List has been
updated.  More corrections have been made as well, in addition to
extra information about the sub-quests, the URA battle, and more.

The FF7 FAQ is more or less complete at this point (I didn't think
I'd be saying that for a _long_ time).  There are still some minor
things to be fixed/added here and there, but this is the last major
revision that I'll be making.

VERSION 1.6x  (July 10, 1997)
A mini-update, I guess.  Everything in the Disc 1 Walkthrough is now
in English, and the Translations and Shopping List sections have been
updated.  Two new sections, Ultimate Weapons and Items and Equipment,
have also been added, in addition to the various usual minor fixes.
The 'Rumors and Speculation' section has also been updated.

VERSION 1.6  (June 20, 1997)
Finished the Materia List and revamped the 'Rumors and Speculation'
section.  Changed the order of some sections and updated lots of
other stuff, including the Translation section.  The Disc One
walkthrough is now completely rewritten--Disc Two should be done
by the next revision or so.  Also added the initial release of the
monster list.  If you haven't noticed, the FAQ has been split into
two files, too.  Also updated the 'Earn Lots of AP' Game Shark code.

VERSION 1.5x  (June 1, 1997)
Added the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code, in addition to some info.
about the hidden (or at least undocumented) Materia Orbs; you may want
to take a look at the 'Underwater Breath' materia.  Also updated the
Rumors and Speculation section, Materia List and added all remaining
master AP scores for the Materia Orbs.

VERSION 1.5  (May 31, 1997)
Added the 'Item Select' Game Shark code!  Fixed up minor changes made
in later releases of v1.4 so everything is up to date at this point.
Also added master AP scores for most of the materia in the Materia List.

VERSION 1.4  (May 29, 1997)
New sections have been added: 'Shopping List' (to make help with
purchases), 'Learning Limit Breaks' (self-explanatory), and
'Translations' (a list of items, etc. and their translated names).
Several sections have also been updated (like the Enemy Skills List
and Materia list).  I am currently re-playing the game to fix
mistakes and clear up any poorly written sections; Disc 1 is a
little over half complete and I will work on the other discs soon.
As usual, more corrections and updates have been made (especially
for my translations :)).  I've added some Game Shark codes that
were submitted to me in the 'Secrets and Strategies' section, as
well as more info on the FMV Viewing Trick.  Finally, the disclaimer
has been tweaked a little (hopefully for the last time :)).

VERSION 1.3  (May 6, 1997)
Updated the Enemy Skills List, Materia List, and Raising Chocobos
sections.  Added information on other Bonus Areas and Cosmo Canyon.
Added the 'Kamedouraku Flyers' and 'All 7 Fever' tricks, as well
as the 'Infinite Limit Break Use' and 'Start with Gold Chocobo' Game
Shark codes.  There's also a new section, the Limit Break List.
General updates and corrections have been made throughout the FAQ.
Now that I have many of the 'correct' names for the items, locations,
etc., most of the names in this FAQ have been changed.  The disclaimer
has also been changed somewhat.

Keep an eye out for a complete listing of monsters and their abilities;
the initial release will be added to this FAQ in an upcoming revision
or be released separately.

VERSION 1.2  (April 20th, 1997)
Complete overhaul of the Enemy Skills list.  How to get the Bahamut
Zero materia, info. on red sub and events at Cosmo Canyon added.  New
ASCII title, and a new URL added (for those of you who want to
understand this game's storyline).

VERSION 1.1  (April 14th, 1997)
Added the FMV Viewing Trick to the 'Secrets and Strategies' section.

VERSION 1.0  (April 12th, 1997)
The Disc Three walkthrough is done, making this version the 'official'
release (since it now guides you through the whole game).  Added the
'Piano Trick', explained how to get the Alexander Materia and how to
reach the lower chest in the east wing of Sephiroth's Mansion.
Altered the Introduction and Revision History sections a bit, and
updated the Enemy Skill List and Materia Orbs sections.  Also added
how to get back into Midgar City.

VERSION 0.4x  (April 7th, 1997)
Various corrections/updates, among them the 'Character Select' code
and info. on the Sleeping Man, as well as the monster in section 4a.

VERSION 0.4  (April 6th, 1997)
The walkthrough for Disc Two is complete!  This FAQ now provides a
complete guide for both Disc 1 and 2 at this point.  The guide for
Disc 3 is currently underway.

VERSION 0.3  (April 5th, 1997)
Began work on Enemy Skill and Summon Materia charts.  Fixed up some
misc. info. and other things in the FAQ, and added the Mini-Battle
game strategy to the 'Having Fun' section.  Added 'Body Heat' Game
Shark code, and more information concerning the 'Character Select'
code.

VERSION 0.2  (March 31st, 1997)
Fixed information on the 'bug' Materia (it's actually Techniques of
the Enemy).  Added the 'Character Select' Game Shark code, which
among other things, lets you play with Aerith AFTER Disc One or even
use Sephiroth!  The Disc Two Walkthrough has just been started and
will be added in good time.

VERSION 0.1  (March 28th, 1997)
First release.  Bare-bones walkthrough for Disc One and other basic
information.  Still more to add and correct.  Contains the 'No Time
Limit' Game Shark code.

Began construction of VERSION 0.0 on February 14th, 1997.


                            ++++++++++++++++++
                             13. INTRODUCTION
                            ++++++++++++++++++

"The town of Midgar is under the tight grip of Shin-Ra, the infamous
conglomerate.  The Shin-Ra Electric Power Company has been exploiting the
life force of the planet, destroying its' precious nature.
Meanwhile, the underground rebel force with a mission, Avalanche, managed
to blow up Makon Furnace No. 1.  Their goal is to destroy Shin-Ra and
stop their atrocities.  It turned out that Cloud, one of the former
Shin-Ra soldiers, helped the explosion.
Can just a handful of brave soldiers save the life of the planet?
Shin-Ra is much too big an enemy to fight against.

THE FATE OF THE PLANET IS ON THIS BATTLE."

So begins Final Fantasy VII's saga, set in a futuristic world where swords
and sorcery are combined with guns and machinery.  This FAQ is designed to
guide people through the game, providing not only a walkthrough for the
adventures contained on each disc but also information on basic gameplay,
secrets and tricks, and more.

This FAQ is based entirely on the Japanese version of FF7.  Therefore,
some things in this guide may not apply to the English version of FF7 when
it is released (presumably on September 7th, 1997).  Furthermore, as the
writer of this FAQ neither speaks nor understands Japanese, this guide is
not 100% accurate.  Although mistakes will be corrected in future
revisions as soon as they are noticed, some parts of this guide are bound
to be unclear on the subject or run the risk of supplying false info.

Any Japanese names that you come across have either been submitted to me
by someone else or I have translated them using a kana chart (and since I
don't know the first thing about the Japanese language, my translations
may not be correct).  Now that I am doing item and name translations,
(as of v1.3 onwards) this is more true than ever.  If you see a
translated name and would like to know the English equivalent, (assuming
there is one) then please refer to the 'Translations' section for details.

Whenever possible, I'll write NSS (Not So Sure) after anything that may
be incorrect or unconfirmable.  Furthermore, the I'll try to provide
names of monsters, cities, locations, etc. when possible, but many things
may be referred to as 'the big brown hut', 'the four-armed red frog
monster', etc. because I don't know the exact name.  This FAQ tries to be
as understandable and clear as possible, but this is not always the case.

Due to the size of this game, the FF7 FAQ will be revised whenever it is
necessary, and can be found at:

                 www.fortunecity.com/bally/orange/25/

You can find revisions elsewhere (look at the top of the FAQ).  While I
update the FAQ whenever I have the spare time, I can't guarantee that
other places will have the latest revision.


                       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                        14. SECRETS AND STRATEGIES
                       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=========================================================================
GETTING YUFFIE KISARAGI
=========================================================================

You can get Yuffie in your party during any disc.  If you're in Disc 1
and are riding around in the Buggy, that will work, too.  The two
places that she appears most often are the forests beyond the Gold
Saucer (in the Gongaga Area), and the small wooded area near the Condor
Fort.  After a few battles, you'll fight Yuffie (seems to be a 1 in 15
chance, if you ask me).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: MEI NO NINJA  <Mysterious Ninja>     LV: 37  HP: 1950  MP: 280

Just attack, really.  The Summon Materia 'Titan' works well.  Yuffie can
do all kinds of cool attacks during this time, but not once she joins
you!  Yuffie's level, HP and MP vary depending on what level your
characters are at.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the battle ends, you'll be in a plain with Yuffie lying nearby.
There's also a Save Point here.  However, if you touch the Save Point,
then go to your menu screen to save, Yuffie escapes and steals 200 gil!
Don't worry, you can meet her again.  You'll have to talk to her several
times to get her to join.  As she and you converse, she'll ask you
several questions, and you can reply in two ways.  To get her to join,
respond like this:

  Bottom answer, Top answer, Bottom answer, Top answer, Bottom answer

Put another way, respond using the second reply, then the first reply,
then the second reply... and so on.  After that, you can name her, and
she'll hook up with Cloud and the rest of the gang.  Note that if you
choose the top answer for the last question she asks, you can name her,
but she'll steal 700 gil from you and run away.  You'll have to repeat
the whole process if you want to get her in your party.


=========================================================================
GETTING VINCENT VALENTINE
=========================================================================

The second 'optional' (or hidden) character in the game, Vincent can
also join your party during any disc.  You'll need the gold key from the
safe in Nivelheim's Shin-Ra Mansion (see below if you don't know how to
open it).  Go down to the pink cavern leading to Sephiroth's library
(it's in the Shin-Ra Mansion, the entrance is in the stone wall in the
eastern wing).

Remember the door to the crypt you couldn't get through?  You can now
enter it.  Stand at the foot of the purple coffin and hit O.  The lid
will fly off and Vincent will talk to you.  Choose the bottom reply when
he asks you a question.  When the coffin closes, press O again.  Choose
the second (bottom) reply when Vincent poses another question, and you
can name him.  Then, try to leave the cavern and he'll join you.  Vincent
can join you from the first time you reach Nivelheim onwards (but not
during Cloud's flashback).

THE SAFE IN NIVELHEIM
=========================================================================

What most people forget when trying to open the safe is that it's just
like a real combination lock...so you have to go in more than one
direction when inputting the numbers.  Furthermore, unless you're
fast enough, you'll run out of time if you try any other combination.
The code is:

        RIGHT TO 36, LEFT TO 10, RIGHT TO 59, RIGHT TO 97

This means that you hold right and scroll through the numbers, then
hold left until you reach 10, then hold right for the last two numbers.
Don't forget to press O to verify each entry.  When the safe opens, a
Summon Materia (Odin) pops out, and you are assaulted by a big goon
(how'd he fit into that little safe?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: ROSUTONANBAA  <Lost Number>          LV: 35  HP: 7000  MP: 300
This boss can be taken out just by attacking and using Limit Breaks.
Magic spells (Flame, Cold, Lighting) that are at level 2 are also
okay to use.  Heal yourself and use Summon Materia (like 'Sumon Chocobo
and Moogle', and you'll win in no time.  Aside from physical attacks,
all this guy can really do is use a Thunder 2 spell on you, but it only
does 400-500 points of damage to one character, so it's nothing to
worry about.  Rarely, he does a double-fisted hammer punch to one
character that averages 2200 points of damage, though, so pack in some
Phoenix Tails before trying to tackle him.  If you blow off his red
half (the one that uses magic) his physical attacks become more
aggressive, so keep your HP up.  Likewise, if his purple half is
destroyed first, the Lost Number will use more mid-level spells, like
Quake 2, against your party.  It is possible to kill this boss without
either part of it dying (by stunning it using the 'Summon Chocobo and
Moogle' spell).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not only do you get an item from the boss once you beat it (it's the
manual for Red 13's Level 4 Limit Break, the Cosmo Memory), but there's
also a gold key lying in the safe that you can grab (Chi x x no Key).
Don't forget to take the Red Materia!  Apparently, there's a paper in
the lower room in the right wing of the mansion that hints at the correct
combination for the safe, but someone like me can't read it :(  Once
you've read the paper, you can find hints throughout the house (by the
piano, next to the chair in the bedroom, etc.)  Refer to the Disc One
Walkthrough for more information.

Did the code still not work?  Remember, the safe's lock is LIKE A REAL
COMBINATION LOCK.  So, when you're turning to 36, you can either land
on it or creep up to it, but you can't hit 37 and go back.  This
applies to the rest of the digits, too; you can't go farther than the
number you want.  If you do (i.e. you go to 09 when trying to get to
10), you'll have to start all over again.


=========================================================================
THE SLEEPING MAN
=========================================================================

Get over 100 wins by fighting battles.  To see how many wins you have,
get in the Highwind or ride a Green, Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo
ever so slightly south and a little ways to the east of Midgar City,
where you'll find a cave surrounded by mountains with a river nearby.
Inside the cave is a sleeping fellow who (usually) tells you how many
wins you've gotten so far.  Not only do you need to have over 100 wins,
but the last two digits have to be the same (100, 111, 255, 733, etc.)

When you have the correct number of victories, talk to the sleeping
man.  He'll toss and turn, then give you an item (Mithril).  Next,
go to the house on the penninsula near the Gold Saucer (you should
recognize it since it's full of weapons inside).  Talk to the man in
the house, and when he gives you a choice, pick the top option.
You'll lose the Mithril, but you now have the choice of opening the
long wooden chest by the bed to get a Gold Bracelet, or examining the
metal lid on the upper floor at the end of the walkway to get the
manual for Aerith's Level 4 Limit Break.

It's probable that you can do this with less than 100 wins, but I'm
not certain of that.  Someone want to verify it for me?


=========================================================================
PIANO TRICK
=========================================================================

Go to Nivelheim (the town by the pointed mountains on the Western
Continent).  Enter Tifa's house (the second building on the right side)
and head upstairs to where her piano is.  Choose the bottom option,
then the bottom option again to play it (you can't use the top option
if you want the manual).  Then, press:

        X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X

                              or*

        D, L, U, L1+T, L1+S, D, L, U, L1+X, R, D, L, D

 * You can also use a combination of buttons and direction presses.

I'd like to stress that as far as I can determine, the result of
playing the piano is random.  Sometimes, nothing happens, other times,
you'll find 1 gil, and other times, you'll find Tifa's Level 4 Limit
Break Manual (keep reading).  I'd also like to state that I've gotten
her manual _without_ having Tifa in my party.  I'm not sure how I did
it, but I have a save file that proves it (see? see!)  I thought I did
it by playing the melody once, exiting out, playing it again, exiting
out again, and then getting back on the piano and pressing L1+T.

But, the way that you're _supposed_ to do it is to stick Tifa in your
party, go to the piano, play it once using the 'button only' method,
and she'll eventually find a letter from her master, Zangan (the caped
guy you saw during the first Nivelheim flashback).  Tifa will get the
Final Heaven Limit Break Manual after reading his letter.


=========================================================================
KEY TO MIDGAR CITY  (AREA 5 KEY)
=========================================================================

<Disc 2 or 3>  First talk to the man standing by the doors back at
Midgar City.  He won't appear until after you've gotten the Highwind
and rescued Cloud from Mideel Village.  Talk to him, then return to the
excavator's village on the Northern Continent.  Chat with the man by the
door and pick the first option, then the second or third option.  While
you could place diggers and hunt for the Key yourself, if you want to
cheat, go over to the destroyed plane atop the dinosaur's skull.  See
the one excavtor near the bottom of the screen?  Near him is a tiny
piece of metal sticking outwards; position yourself underneath it and
press up so that your character is looking forward, then dig.

You can use the Key to enter the locked gates near Area 7 and look
around Midgar City.  If you go into the church where you met Aerith,
you can see her bending over the flowers; she'll flicker and disappear
after a second.  There's not a lot to do here, but if you go back to
the Wall Market and go to the 'ITEM' building with the machine gun
inside it, you can get Tifa's Ultimate Weapon by examining the computer
before the gun fires upon you (you don't need Tifa to get the item).
Also, remember the man in the gun shop that you bought the Zinc Batteries
from to reach the Shin-Ra Building back in Disc 1?  The man in the left
side of the shop will sell you an accessory (Nusuzoku no Shoute) for
129,000 gil this time around.


=========================================================================
KAMEDOURAKU FLYERS
=========================================================================

There are six of these flyers scattered throughout the world.  You can
find them in the following locations:

Flyer No. 1:  Midgar City...the town next to Aerith's house.  Go to
              the second floor of the southeastern building and look
              at the papers taped to the wall by the stairwell.

Flyer No. 2:  Shinra HQ...on the first floor, check out the board with
              the papers on it near the elevators.  The only time you
              can read this flyer is at the beginning of the game or
              when you raid Midgar in Disc 2.

Flyer No. 3:  Gold Saucer...go to the Ghost Square and enter the hotel.
              Read the sign that says 'SHOP' next to the shop entrance.

Flyer No. 4:  Cosmo Canyon...check the left wood post of the Tigerlily
              Arms Shop.

Flyer No. 5:  Cosmo Canyon...the gold paper by the door on the second
              floor of the inn (the entrance is behind some hanging
              cloth near the bonfire).

Flyer No. 6:  Utai...the bottom floor of Yuffie's house; it's the wall
              scroll to the right of the doorway.  You can't get there
              unless you've done the sub-quest (refer to the 'Bonus
              Areas' section).

You don't have to find the flyers (they look like pieces of paper) in
order.  Whenever you have read all six of them, go to the restaurant
in Utai (the large building in the southwestern corner of town).  Talk
to the barkeep and you'll get a Power Up, Guard Up, Magic Up, Mind Up,
Speed Up, Luck Up, and a Last Elixir.


=========================================================================
ALL 7 FEVER
=========================================================================

As easy as this trick sounds, it's harder to perform than you might
think.  One of your characters has to have a current HP of 7777 (or a
maximum and a current HP of 7777...I'm not sure yet).  This can be done
by getting injured, equipping materia, or raising levels.  When that
particular character enters a battle, the message 'Ooru 7 Fiibaa' (All 7
Fever) will appear.  It will show up every time the 'fevered' character
attacks, too.

During this time, the person affected by the 'All 7 Fever' will make one
_normal_ attack against each enemy when their Time Bar is filled, even if
you have materia such as Slice Everybody or Everything Affect All
equipped.  However, assuming they don't miss, that person will always
strike for 7777 damage, even if an enemy has special defenses.
Furthermore, that person behaves as if he/she was berzerked (i.e. you
can't select commands for them since they will do nothing but attack),
and can take no other action (even if you're wearing a Counter materia).
They can still lose HP or be affected by enemy abilties/magic/etc.

There are two major drawbacks to this trick; your current HP drops to 1
point after the battle (it can be healed by normal means), and you can't
repeat the trick unless you have 7777 HP exactly.  Since I think your
maximum HP has to be 7777 too, this means that you can't repeat that
trick once you raise a level, since you will gain HP and it will affect
the amount of HP a materia is adding/taking away from your 'real' total.
This means that the only way to permanently keep this trick is to get
really good at using materia orbs to customize your character's life,
or by killing that character before the end of the battle so that they
don't gain experience ^_^;


=========================================================================
FMV VIEWING TRICK
=========================================================================

All you FF7 owners out there should try this!  Go to any point in the
game with an FMV sequence (such as starting a new game--the part where
Cloud runs up to the Makoro furnace).  Open your PSX and put in another
disc.  When you continue playing (the game won't crash) the FMV sequence
will be replaced with one from the disc!  (Using the last example, put
in Disc 3 and you'll see the sequence with the stone pillars rising from
the center of the last level; it's the same bit you see after killing
Jenova Synthesis before fighting Sephiroth for the last time.)

What's really weird is that you can keep playing the game with another
disc in your system!  I beat the whole first part of the game and the CD
would load up the various levels!  I don't know for sure, but I guess
that means that the ENTIRE game is written on each disc (barring the FMV,
obviously)!  If you want to verify this, try starting up a save file from
disc 3 and replace it with, say, the first disc.  You can do the
submarine/snowboard sequences, or go to any place you couldn't go to in
the first disc--and all the data loads up!

Going back to the trick, though, you can try this anywhere, and you
usually get cool results.  For instance, near the end of Disc 2, the
Weapon monster rises up from the sea and attacks Midgar City--and gets
decapitated by the Mako Cannon.  I switched to the first disc before
viewing the FMV and saw parts of the intro, and some parts from the
FMV during/after Aerith's death!  If you're fast, try switching the
discs during the opening FMV when you start a new game; with Disc 2
inserted, it showed some more FMV of Aerith (this is when you return
with Buugen Haagen to the Ancient City).

Even stranger is the fact that you can still see text/graphics over the
FMV in some cases, such as Cloud and the Avalanche member running
offscreen just after the furnace explodes near the start of the first
disc, or Cid talking to Cloud on his phone during the part where the
Weapon attacks Midgar City (of course, this is over the FMV from the
disc you've chosen).  And as I mentioned before, you can play normally
after the FMV is over, even with the other disc in your PSX!

In earlier versions of this FAQ, I said that there was 'hidden' FMV of
a silver car rotating around.  Several people e-mailed me and informed
me that you can normally view this in the Shinra HQ during Disc One.
What's interesting, though, is that when I saw this FMV by using the
trick above, I had switched Disc One with Disc Three (at the FMV with
the bridge collapsing in Cloud's flashback).  This means that it's on
at least two of the three discs.  Why it's there is another story.
Also, the scene with the planets in Buugen Haagen's observatory (which
is only in Disc 1) will also be partially displayed if you switch it
with Disc 2 or 3.


=========================================================================
ALWAYS RUN FROM BATTLES
=========================================================================

Interestingly enough, you will instantly flee a battle if at least one
character is petrified, stopped, or paralyzed while in the 'running'
pose.  So as long as you are not fighting a boss or have been ambushed
(see the Running section for more detail), you can always escape simply
by letting the enemy do one of the above attacks to you, or by doing it
to yourself (via Spell Materia)!  This is also useful if all your members
are paralyzed, stopped, or whatever, and your last character is about to
suffer a similar fate.  Simply try to run away (even if you can't), and
you'll escape the moment you are hit by the attack.  The only exception
to this trick is that if you are petrified and your other teammates are
dead or petrified, then you will always lose.  This doesn't work on boss
battles, by the way.


=========================================================================
RAISING CHOCOBOS
=========================================================================

This section is based upon a summarized guide written by Nikki.  Some
information is also taken from a more detailed guide written by Crow.
Their addresses can be found in the Special Thanks section near the end
of the FF7 FAQ.

You're going to need a lot of money, patience, and luck if you want to
raise chocobos.  The payoff is that you can breed chocobos that can fly,
swim, climb over mountains and go to places normal vehicles can't reach.

a)  Go to the Chocobo Farm once you've accquired the Highwind.  Enter
    the house (not the barn) and talk to the person there.  Choose
    the first option, then choose the top choice.  Doing this will let
    you purchase one of the stalls in the barn.  You'll need to purchase
    all six, but they cost 10000 gil a pop.  If you want, you can do
    the process with only four stalls, but you'll have to kick out the
    chocobos you don't need to make room for the newer ones.

b)  Leave and get on the airship.  Fly to the northern continent and
    land near the lone house surrounded by grass (it's exactly to the
    northwest of the farm).  Equip one character with a Steal (yellow)
    materia and keep walking around on the grass until you fight a
    large red reptile (Brachosaur?)  Try to steal from him until you
    get a Karabu Fruit (you'll get a message with an exclamation mark
    if you stole something).  Run away or beat him, then repeat the
    process three times so that you have three Karabu Fruits.  You can
    also get this item from the same enemy if you go to the tip of the
    penninsula near the excavator's village on the Northern Continent
    where the dark grass is.

c)  Now, go to the chocobo tracks near the Gold Saucer (by the shore).
    Equip someone with a Chocobo Attract materia and walk along the
    tracks until you enter a battle with a Chocobo.  Don't kill the
    chocobo, but do kill the other enemies.  When the battle is over,
    press X to dismount and select the top option to make the chocobo
    return to the farm.

d)  Go to the tracks on the Southern Continent, near the forest where
    you found Cloud in Disc 2.  Unlike the walking kind, you can get
    running chocobos here.  Just repeat step (c) to catch one.  Wait
    a second--save your game.  If you didn't get the right type of
    chocobo (more about this in part e), you can reset the game and
    try again: the chocobo's gender is determined randomly each time,
    so you can end up with the correct gender if you keep resetting
    and naming the Chocobo until you get the one you want.

e)  Return to the chocobo farm.  Talk to the guy standing still in the
    barn and choose the 3rd option, then the first choice twice.  Name
    your chocobo, then repeat with the other bird.  This will also place
    your chocobos in the stables.  You can tell by their stance (walking
    or running) if they are the right type.  To tell your chocobo's
    gender and race ranking (more on this later), go up to them in the
    barn and press O.  Next to their name are two characters.  The last
    character is the same, but the first character identifies the
    chocobo's gender:

          Female (me):        |        Male (o):       |
                       __    /                   ---------
                          \/                         / |
                         / \                      _/   |
                      _/                            ___|

    You'll want to make sure that the running chocobo is female and
    the walking chocobo is male.  If you have a chocobo walking with
    his head down, put it in a stall, then talk to the man again and
    choose the 6th option from the top.  Pick that chocobo and choose
    the top option twice, then the bottom option once to let that bird
    go so you can get another one.  If the sex of the chocobo is wrong,
    just use the trick in the above section to change it.

f)  Do you have the correct type and gender?  Talk to the man in the
    barn again and choose the fifth option from the top.  Choose one
    of the chocobos by walking up to it and pressing O.  Pick the top
    option, then repeat with the other chocobo.  When you get another
    choice, pick the top option.  A list will appear.  Remember the
    items you stole from that reptile in the north?  It will appear
    as the item 7th from the top (there should be a 3 next to it
    since you stole 3 items).  Choose and and choose the top choice.

g)  Hopefully you got a green Chocobo!  If you got a blue one or a
    yellow one, reset and try to mate the two chocobos again (repeat
    step f).  You'll want a blue chocobo, but if you get one right
    now, it's harder to breed a green one -NSS-.  Keep note of your
    chocobo's gender--it's important.

h)  At this point, you can't mate the yellow chocobos again or the
    green chocobo.  If you don't want to wait, repeat steps (c)
    through (f) and try to breed a Blue Chocobo who is the opposite
    gender of your Green Chocobo.  If you have time on your hands,
    though, waste it and come back later.  You can re-breed your
    two yellow chocobos and try to get a Blue Chocobo.  Either way,
    it will take _a lot_ of tries, but you save the trouble of
    capturing and renaming chocobos if you waste some time and just
    re-breed your two yellow birds.  Remember the item that you
    used (Karabu Fruit), will now have a '2' next to it since you
    already used one.  Don't worry, it will still stay in the same
    place on the menu.

i)  Okay!  Now, you should have a Blue chocobo and a Green chocobo of
    opposite genders.  If you caught another pair of yellow chocobos,
    you won't have any more stall space and you'll have to let the
    two yellow ones go.  If you simply breeded them again, you'll
    still have two stalls left open.  Since the Blue chocobo is a
    newborn, you'll need to waste some more time before you can breed
    it to the Green one.  Hop in the Highwind and fly back to the
    house on the grassy patch in the Northern Continent.  Talk to the
    purple geezer and choose the first option.  He will offer to sell
    ou items; buy 40 of the ones that cost 5000 gil (Shirukisu
    Vegetable).

    Return to the Chocobo Farm and give ten of them to your blue
    chocobo and 10 to your green chocobo.  You can do this by picking
    the fourth option when you talk to the man, then picking the
    Shirukisu Vegetable (it's the next to last one).  Pick the chocobo
    you want to feed it to and press up or down on your controller to
    increase the number.  Then press O twice to feed the chocobo.

j)  Go to the Gold Saucer (you can get there from the sky lift in
    North Corel).  Go to the Chocobo Square, enter the main
    building, and talk to the girl in front of the 'STAFF ROOM'
    door.  Choose the first option and pick either your green
    chocobo or your blue chocobo to race.  Then pick the top choice
    two times and press Start at the next screen to start the race.

    The point of racing is to improve your chocobo's race ranking.
    Remember what happened when you checked your chocobo's stats?
    Underneath the gender was the race ranking.  You need to improve
    it from a C to an A-class ranking, and you can do so by racing.
    It doesn't matter if you lose; just keep racing until you gain
    new classes.  Refer to the chocobo-racing tips in section 3o if
    you need help, although it's easy to win the races using
    Automatic Sequence Mode.  Every time you win a race, pick the
    top option to get an item, the bottom option twice to get an
    item, or the bottom option, then the top option to get some GP.
    Remember, to raise a class level, you have to come in first place
    (and even then you may need to get a high score such as 1-2 or
    1-2 a few times before you'll gain a level).  When you do raise
    a race ranking, the girl will tell you.  You can see your
    chocobo's class every time you race it (at the screen before the
    race starts).  Obviously, it will take quite a few races before
    you can hit class 'A' (it took me around 3 races to raise to
    the next class each time).

k)  Fun, wasn't it?  Get back in the Highwind and return to the
    Chocobo Farm.  Refer to step (f) and breed the blue and green
    chocobos together.  With a little luck, you'll find a black
    chocobo in one of the empty stalls the following day.  Yes,
    you may have used up your last piece of Karabu, but you won't
    need it anymore.  Once again, take note of your black chocobo's
    gender.

l)  There's an elongated island with a forest on it northeast of the
    Chocobo Farm.  Go into the forest and wander around until you
    run into a tiny monster wearing boxing gloves (Goblin).  You can
    steal a Zeio Fruit off of it--you only need one.  After you
    get it, fly to the chocobo tracks on the west edge of the Northern
    Continent and capture one; you can get the dashing kind here.
    Then go back to the farm, name your yellow Chocobo, and put it in
    the stalls.  If it isn't the opposite gender of your black chocobo,
    reset and try the naming process again.  Refer to step (e) if you
    forgot how to do this.

m)  You should have 20 Shirukisu Vegetables left, so feed 10 of them to
    the dashing yellow chocobo and 10 to your black chocobo (just like
    how you did it in step i).  Now for the real fun part--you have to
    get an A-rank class for both the yellow and black chocobos!  So,
    just repeat what you did back in step (j).  It will take a while,
    but when they're both at race ranking A, leave the Gold Saucer and
    return to the Chococbo Farm.

n)  Now, breed your yellow and black chocobo together.  This time,
    use the Zeio Fruit (it's at the very bottom of the list).
    Once again, refer to step (f) if you have trouble navigating
    the menus.  It may have to retry a few times, but you'll end up
    with the gold chocobo eventually.  Now you can go anywhere on
    the World Map!

YELLOW CHOCOBOS can go anywhere you can normally get to on foot.  The
sole advantage is that a chocobo is a lot quicker than walking.

BLUE CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers, but they can't go past waterfalls.
They can also walk in shallow water, just like Cid's airplane could.

GREEN CHOCOBOS can run over mountains, even the pointed mountains by
Nivelheim.  They can also dash over _most_ cliffs and drops.

BLACK CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers and move around in shallow water.
They can also run over mountains and cliffs.  Unlike the blue or green
chocobos, the black variety can go over any cliff or drop: even
walk up or down waterfalls, enter the canyon surrounding the Ancient
City, or walk _over_ the ice forest that you have to traverse in Disc
2 after the snowboard scene!

GOLD CHOCOBOS can do everything a black chocobo can--they can also
walk in the ocean, allowing you to go anywhere you want, even into
the dirt pit surrounding the Gold Saucer (just like the Saucer
vehicle).  Truly the ultimate in transportation!

In case you didn't know about it, you can rotate the chocobo you're
viewing when using the various options in the Chocobo Farm by holding
the R1 or L1 buttons :)

Unlike chocobos that you capture and ride around on, the ones that you
ride out from the Chocobo Farm are a little tamer.  They'll stay where
you get off them until you ride them again, and you can do this as much
as you want and return them to the Farm whenever you want (although you
can only have one chocobo out at a time).  If you're riding a chocobo
and you try to enter the Highwind, you'll find it in the 'Chocobo' area
of the the ship.  You'll automatically be riding the chocobo when you
land the ship, too.

UNCHARTED ISLES
=========================================================================

Head due south from Cosmo Canyon in the Highwind, then go a little to
the west.  You'll see an island that's part dirt, part grass, with
a smaller grassy island nearby.  This isle doesn't appear on the Map,
but if you land the Highwind on the grassy plain and run around in
the dirt long enough, you can fight Sabotenders (better known as
Cactrots; those little cactus guys from FF3)!  You can't get Rename
Cards from them or anything like that, but it's kinda fun fighting
them.  Actually, the name of this island is 'Cactus Island' so it
makes sense to find them here.

To get to the second isle, head for the two islands near to each other
on the northeastern edge of the map.  Then go north (and a little more
to the east), and you'll come across an oval-shaped island surrounded
by mountains.  There's a cave entrance here, but you can't land there
in the Highwind.  For more about the island, refer to the Bonus Areas
part in section 6.  The name of this place is 'Round Island'.

GAME SHARK CODES
=========================================================================

I'm not much of a code-maker myself, but here are some cheats you might
want to try.  Remember, you need a Game Shark or a Pro Action Replay for
these to work.  Some people have reported problems with these codes
(such as, these codes don't work with a PAR).  FYI, I made these codes
using a Game Shark with PAR software (version 1.98), so I really don't
know why it wouldn't work on both devices.

All of the codes in this FAQ were made by me, unless otherwise stated.
If you want to reprint, submit, or display these codes, please give
credit where it is due.  If you want to submit a code, just tell me
the code itself, what it does, and include any glitches/problems with
the code.  Oh, and please tell me the code's creator if you didn't make
it yourself.  Remember, these codes were made to work on the Japanese
version of FF7--they _may_ work on the English-text version or Japanese
re-released version, but I don't know for certain.


FF7 MASTER CODE                                         80000000 - 0000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the cheat that lets you use other codes with this game.  I don't
know if it (and the other codes listed here) will work on every disc,
but if a code doesn't, then I'll let you know.


NO TIME LIMIT - 1ST POSITION                            800F5E88 - FFFE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With this code, anyone in the first position always has a full Time bar.
This means that he or she can repeatedly choose commands and will do
them as fast as he is able.  The other two characters act normally.

The plus side to this is that you can attack many times in a single turn
of combat.  Also, if you reach your Limit Break, you can repeatedly
activate it as long as you start doing so before the first Limit Break
begins.  (As an example, I used an old file and was able to kill the
boss of the Shinra Boat in the first round.  This was possible because
Barett already had a full Limit bar when the battle began.  I rapidly
selected Barett's Heavy Shot whenever the menu popped up.  He did
something like 20 Heavy Shots in a row.)  While this is obviously useful
when attacking or using Limit Breaks, you can't 'stockpile' Summon uses
or Magic casting.  Even if you select to summon, say, Ifrit nine times,
you'll get a message for the subsequent 8 summons and nothing will
happen.  Similarly, if you choose to cast a spell five times but don't
have enough MP, then you'll only use the spell until your MP runs out,
at which point you get a message telling you so and nothing happens until
your commands 'run out'.  Just because you have a full Time bar doesn't
give you extra initiative, either; enemies will still attack you when
they are able (once you've stopped performing a command), and your allies
will do whatever you told them to do (once again, as soon as you stop
doing something).  This code is especially useful if you're using the
'Control Enemy' Materia, since you can have them do whatever you want
as many times as you want (as long as they don't get hit).


CHARACTER SELECT - 3RD POSITION                         8009B376 - FF0x
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter this code, but replace the last digit with one of the following:

        x = 0  -  Cloud Strife
            1  -  Barett Wallace
            2  -  Tifa Rockheart
            3  -  Aerith Gainsborough
            4  -  Red 13
            5  -  Yuffie Kisaragi
            6  -  Cait Sith
            7  -  Vincent Valentine
            8  -  Cid Hiwind
            9  -  <Young Cloud>
            A  -  <Sephiroth>
            B  -  <Chocobo>
            C  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)
            D  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)

When you start the game, the character in your 3rd slot (position) will
'turn into' the character you've chosen.  If the graphics are messed up,
try entering and exiting the PHS screen to clear things up a bit.  If
the code doesn't work initially, try checking your character's stats in
the PHS screen or switching that character in and out of the PHS screen.
This code works much better if you use a new game or have a saved file
in which the third character slot is empty.  Basically, the code works
like this:

If you want to have any of the 'normal' characters, i.e. Cloud to Cid,
then they'll usually start off at level 1.  The game won't freeze or
mess up if you talk to someone or if an event occurs, but if you're not
supposed to have that character yet, they won't appear or interact with
anyone.

The sole exception to this is Aerith.  Like Cloud, she cannot be removed
from the party, or even the PHS system once she is put in reserve.
Furthermore, the game WILL freeze or hang if you put her in her party
once she's left for the last village, or if you have her join at any
point from the end of Disc One onwards.  What's really weird about this
is that in some cases (like after the snowboarding event on Disc 2, when
the party comes to in the snow), she DOES have her own dialogue (these
seem to be 'any character' quotes, though).  Those of you who want
another code can try:


PLAY AS AERITH - 3RD POSITION                           801D3330 - 3313
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It only lets you select Aerith, but seems to mess up less than the
character select code.  To choose her, go into the PHS screen, place
your character on the 3rd person (who you don't have to remove), and
press the O button twice (as if you were going to check his/her
status).  With this code, Aerith is 'invisible' during most events/
conversations and says nothing.


As for the 'Character Select' code:

Make sure that you don't have the same character in the third space
that you're going to use with the first code (i.e. don't have Cait
Sith in the third space and then enter a code for Cait Sith).  The
result is that you can make 'copies' of that character, but not
select others.  Unless you want to have, say, two Baretts--then put
Barett in the first or second space and then use the Barett code
in the third space.

The special characters are the ones whose names are in brackets.  While
you probably recognize Young Cloud and Sephiroth from Cloud's flashback
after reaching the World Map, the Chocobo and the two 'Nau Purintingu'
portraits don't have any real stats, they'll just have Cloud's instead.

The problem with the special characters is that you cannot turn another
character into them, or their stats 'merge'.  The result is that not only
does that character not even appear, but they lose all their HP instantly
(and don't appear, either) during battle sequences.  Right now, Young
Cloud and Sephiroth are the only 'special' characters that don't merge
instantly.  The Chocobo face appears when you try to raise Chocobos in
the second disk, so that explains that.  The character that I called
'Kanjimaru' is in fact translated as 'Now Printing' in English.  Mr.
Kelley (who translated the name) suggests that it was perhaps a test
portrait made by the programmers (sort of a default portrait perhaps
used before the actual portraits were drawn/decided upon), or simply
a joke by the programmers, which makes sense as the portrait has no
real stats, equipment, or anything else.

So, to play with one of the special characters, you have to have a blank
opening.  I've been having some trouble 'creating' a blank space using
the PHS system, so I was forced to find a file when there are two
characters or less.  The Shinra boat (Disc One) was the one file I had
on hand to use, so it's the one I'll use in my example (the file's at
the second Save Point, just before you meet with your friends and
encounter Sephiroth).  You could also start a new game since there's
no one in the third position.  If you can't get this code to work
(especially with one of the special characters), try it with a blank
space for optimum results.  So, to test out one of the special
characters at the Shinra boat, for example:

Enter the code and start the game, then choose the file.  Cloud will
be at the top, and at the bottom will be the messed-up portrait and
stats of either Young Cloud or Sephiroth.  Go talk to Barett, in
order to speed up events, then go meet your friends.  When you're
asked to pick new party members, kick out the 'special' character and
take two other characters.  This prevents the game from glitching in
the next scene.  Be sure to turn off the Game Shark so that your new
allies won't suddenly 'become' Young Cloud or Sephiroth.

Then, talk to one of your allies and remove your third member.  Flick
up the switch on the Game Shark, and you've got your special character!
You can try them out in battle if you'd like in the hold below, but
don't try to meet Sephiroth with Sephiroth in your party or the game
will crash.  For some strange reason, if Red 13 is your third member
and you turn the switch on to enable the code just before the battle
with Sephiroth's creature, the two won't merge and you can fight the
boss with Sephiroth.

Special notes about the characters:

SEPHIROTH is still automatically controlled by the computer.  However,
you can de-equip and take his Materia for your own!  Even better, you
can use this code at the very start of the game to have Sephiroth
accompany Cloud into the Shinra reactor!  If you leave the code on
and have him switch places with Cloud, you'll have three Sephiroths
to fight with!  (This does crash the game with a high rate, though).
BTW, even if you remove Sephiroth's Materia, he can still cast magic
in battle!  If you start a new game with him as your character, you
can't select Materia since you can't choose that option yet.

While YOUNG CLOUD has a Limit Break, it (like Sephiroth's) doesn't
really exist (it can't be used in battle, even if you try it with
the 'Infinite Limit Break Use' code below).

The CHOCOBO and both NOW PRINTINGS always act as if they are 'merged'.
I have yet to find a way around this, so they are unplayable for the
time being, even though you can get their portraits (I doubt you
can play with either of them).

Unfortunately, the code for VINCENT VALENTINE almost always results
in a 'merged' (and hence, unplayable) version of Sephiroth, even if
I activate him in a blank space.  Once you get Vincent (normally),
both this and the Sephiroth code give mixed results, at best.  Even
without Vincent, this code gives you some strange results.  For
instance, even though Sephiroth doesn't really have a Limit Break,
the name that is given is Vincent's initial Break.

As you can see, this code is far from perfect, and I haven't been able
to test the codes fully.  If you have trouble using these codes,
remember that you MUST have a blank space to put one of the 'special'
characters or the code won't work and both characters will merge.
Also, don't be surprised if the game hangs, especially during character
events, even if the code you're using is for one of the 'normal
characters' (Aerith in particular).

With both of these codes (characters & Aerith) it's a good idea for
you to flip off the code after getting the character you want to
lessen the chance of the game hanging.



BODY HEAT ALWAYS STAYS AT 31 DEGREES                    80074DC4 - 2000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This code has no effect on the game unless you go to the outside ledges
of the Frozen Mountain.  While there, your body heat will stay at a
constant 31 degrees, and neither tapping the S button or being exposed
to the cold air will have any affect to your temperature.  This way,
you can explore the mountain freely without worrying about passing out.
The number may fluctuate a bit (it sometimes stops at 91), but your
heat will still be unaffected.


INFINITE LIMIT BREAK USE - 3RD POSITION                 800F619C - 00FF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as this code is activated, your Limit Bar instantly fills up
and stays full until you use a Limit Break.  It then immediately fills
again, allowing you to use your Breaks as often as you'd like.  The
only side effect is that you can 'choose' Breaks that you don't really
have--this has no affect on the actual game aside from wasting a turn
and if you try to use one, you get a message telling you that you don't
have enough MP.  This code has no effect on Vincent after he's done
any of his Breaks, and it doesn't allow characters to use Limit Breaks
when they normally can't (Sephiroth, Young Cloud, Cait Sith <once
he's used the Slot Suit and gotten three moogles>, or characters who
can't use them due to their status, such as petrification).  I really
want to get a '1st position' code so I could use it with the 'No Time
Limit' code...imagine what you could do with that.  In fact, I've
been trying to get most of my codes to work for players in other
positions, so maybe I'll have some new stuff for you coders to cheat
with when the next revision is put up.


START WITH GOLD CHOCOBO                                 800E54B4 - 0004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This code suffers from some MAJOR drawbacks, but at least it's usable.
If I can tweak it enough to get a real chocobo select, then this code
will be updated.  When activated, it turns your chocobo into a gold
chocobo.  The color and type remain the same, but you can cross cliffs,
mountains, rivers, shallow water, oceans, go up waterfalls, etc. (as if
you were riding a gold chocobo).  However, this code has it's share of
flaws, namely:

You can't do this with wild chocobos that you catch: you have to catch
a chocobo, send it to the Chocobo Farm, name it and ride it out of the
farm, _then_ activate the code.  This effectively prevents you from
using this code until about halfway through Disc 2 when the option of
chocobo breeding is available to you, so you can't cheat wildly on the
first disc and do things like skip to new areas, bypass levels, or
grab the Knights of the Round Materia at such an early point in the
game :(  Secondly, you can't leave the World Map while the code is on,
so you'll have to turn off the code before entering any area.  When
you come back out, the chocobo will have 'reverted' to normal, so
you'll have to get back on and flip the switch up again to re-activate
the code.  Also, the code sometime glitches if you enter the dirt pit
around the Gold Saucer.  I had to have all the chocobo types before I
could make this code in the first place, so it didn't help me much. :(


ITEM SELECT                                               8009B4xx - yzzz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is THE code that I've been wanting to make since I bought this game,
and I'm quite overjoyed to have it.  I wish there were more secret items
in the game, and I would have really liked to get some Key Items, but
that's another code for another day.  Don't forget that you can sell
these items for loads of cash (as long as the switch is up), and you can
use them to empower your characters (try the '-Appu' items) early on in
the game.  Enjoy!

Please take note:  As long as you follow the below guidelines (remember
to be careful when putting in the two 'location' digits), this code
should work.  Several people have been complaining that they can't get
the code to work--even the people with the same GS and version number
as mine (1.98).  If you've _carefully_ tried this code and can't get any
results, then you may simply not be able to use the code on your game.
I have NO IDEA what causes this and I'm sorry I can't offer more help to
those with problems concerning this code or the Materia Select code
(they both work in the same manner).

And yes, saving your game with this code _will_ save the items into
memory--you'll still have to be careful that you don't end up with the
'battle' glitch' described below.

An example code would be 8009B4A8 - 202A for the Ghost Hand item, for
those of you who don't understand how the x/y/z entries work.

xx = Location where item appears on the Item Select Screen.  You can
     change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
     multiple items of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
     (i.e. C2, 9A, or 88) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
     would put an item over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
     game may freeze or the item may not appear.  Finally, try to keep
     the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

  y = No. of items; you'll have an infinite amount unless you turn
      the switch off (usually).  The number you enter is converted
      to hexidecimal form (so what you put in won't correlate with
      the # of items you get).  Keep in mind that 0 is a valid
      number and can be used.

 -   Codes ending in 066 - 07F give you these items.  As of right now,
     I don't know what their purpose is (they may be disabled Key
     Items, I think).
 -   Codes ending in 080 - 08F are swords for Cloud.
 -   Codes ending in 090 - 09F are claws for Tifa.
 -   Codes ending in 0A0 - 0AF are cannons for Barett.
 -   Codes ending in 0B0 - 0BD are combs for Red XIII.
 -   Codes ending in 0BE - 0C8 are rods for Aerith.
 -   Codes ending in 0C9 - 0D6 are spears for Cid.
 -   Codes ending in 0D7 - 0E4 are shurikens for Yuffie.
 -   Codes ending in 0E5 - 0F1 are megaphones for Cait Sith.
 -   Codes ending in 0F2 - 0FE are handguns for Vincent.
     The code ending in 0FF looks like a gun, but it is in
     fact Sephiroth's Masamune blade.
 -   Codes ending in 100 - 11F are defensive bracelets.
 -   Codes ending in 120 - 13F are accessories you equip.
 -   Codes ending in 140 - FFF are 'glitch' items that don't exist
     and have no purpose/effect on the game.

If you have this code activated and you go into a battle, you may get
a strange effect that prevents you from fighting the battle.  As the
battle begins, these messages will appear, one after the other:

                      
                  
                  xx  

I think it would be translated as:

                xxx: ### / Error Occurred: ##
                L1+R1+SELECT x Reset xxx
                System Error x xx xxxx

Should you press L1+R1+Select at any time, you're instantly taken out of
the battle.  While you don't gain AP, gil, or experience points or items,
you don't lose anything, either.  Not only can this be used to bypass
normal battles, but it can be used during boss battles and the game will
continue as if you had fought and beaten the boss!

This is pure speculation on my part, but I think this is probably some
sort of error checker/debugger that was used by the game's programmers
to test battle sequences, probably to fix up any flaws in the 'Active
Time Battle' system.  This seems possible because the number seem to
indicate your party's Agility compared to the enemies (I think).  And
assuming my translations are correct (assuming, mind you :)) it would
make some sense.

Keep in mind that this may still happen even with the code off.  So,
it's a good idea not to have this code on when you go into a battle.
The best procedure would probably be to put in the codes for the items
you want, then save your game and load it without using this code.
Then, make sure that you don't have any spare items left in your menu
(use them, sell them, or try 're-equipping' them to reduce the amount
that you have--if you re-equip them you'll still keep one, but the
others will vanish).  Of course, if you don't want to fight any battles,
then leave the code activated :)


MATERIA SELECT                                            8009B6xx - 00yy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well well!  Here's an interesting code.  It works very much like the
Item Select code above, except that you have to go into the Materia
Screen.  As long as the switch is up, you have an infinite number of
whatever Materia you've selected.  The only bad thing about this code
is that it will sometimes start off the Materia orbs with 'beyond master'
levels, meaning that you can use all their abilities, but you can't get
another one by mastering it.

xx = Location where the materia appears on the Materia Menu.  You can
     change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
     multiple materia of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
     (i.e. A0, C4, or 86) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
     would put a materia over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
     game may freeze or the materia may not appear.  Finally, try to
     keep the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

 - Codes ending in 00 - 0D, 10 and 12 are Independant Materia.
 - Codes ending in 0E, 0F and 17 - 23 are Combination Materia.
 - Codes ending in 13 - 15, 24, 25, 27 - 2C and 30 are Command Materia.
 - Codes ending in 31 - 3E, 40, 41, and 44 - 49 are Magic Materia.
 - Codes ending in 4A - 5A are Summon Materia.
 - Codes ending in 2D - 2F, 89 are game glitches and not real Materia.
 - However, equipping the '089' materia will raise most of your stats.
   to 255 and your MAX MP to 999, although your HP will be dramatically
   reduced.
 - All other codes (5B - FF, excluding 89) are game glitches and not
   real Materia.

Here are materia charts for each of the 'disabled' materia.  Please note
that the abilities/AP levels of these materia tend to fluctuate, even if
you put these in using the Game Shark, saved your game, and then played
again without the GS codes on.  Refer to the 'Main Menu' section of the
first part of the FAQ for information on Materia descriptions, etc.

SUICHUU KOKYUU  (Underwater Breath) - Independant Materia          1 star
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Has no description.

It says it's ability is 'SuichuuKokyuu*'

This materia seems to have no effect when equipped, nor does it affect
anything or anyone at any point in the game, as far as I can tell.
Unlike all other materia, it has only one star.  I would assume that
this Materia starts off mastered, but because of the Materia Select code,
I have way over a million AP and I can't seem to make that number go
down.  It could be that you have to master it (just like other materia)
but then it would be the only materia in the game that starts off with
no mastered star levels.


* The info. box will give the stats. of the last Materia the cursor was
  on should you move it around (unless it was last on an Independant
  Materia, in which case it will display 'SuichuuKokyuu' for the ability
  name).

Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (11).

NOTE:  If you want to learn more about this materia, please refer to the
'Rumors and Speculation' and 'Documents' sections for more detailed
conjecture.  For those of you who keep asking, I've been to the Ancient
City and _nothing_ happens.  Believe me, I've experimented with this
materia in just about every possible way and it doesn't seem to have
any effect in the game.

HOUSOKU  (Law*) - Command Materia               20000 AP          2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Has no description.

LV1:  ZENINAGE  (Coin Toss)  
      Just like the 'Zeninage' skill of the 'Nageru' materia.  Although
      it doesn't say it, you also have the Nageru skill (Throw) in
      battle, too.

Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (26).

*  Mr. Kelley points out that this is most likely a joke by the
   programmers.  'Law' is what lawyers deal with, and the listed skill
   given for this materia is Coin Toss.  As in 'you have to throw away
   your money when dealing with lawyers'.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUUSUTAA  (Booster) - Combination Materia       90000 AP          5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Has no description.

It says it's ability is 'Buusutaa'.

So far, it doesn't seem to affect any Materia I equip it to.  From the
name, though, I'd imagine that it's supposed to increase the range/
effectiveness/power of the Materia that you combine it with or perhaps
increase the amount of AP you earn for that Materia.

Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (16).


Here are some codes sent in by contributors:

ALWAYS HAVE 9999999 GIL                                 8009B9F8 - 967F
submitted by <erwind@sby.mega.net.id>                   8009B9FA - 0098
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as this code is activated, you'll always have 9999999 gil, even
if you win a battle or purchase something (you can turn the code off to
spend and gain money normally, and it won't drop down to the original
amount you had before you used this code).  If you turn off the code and
earn a lot of gil, the numbers may look a little buggy, but it's not a
harmful effect and it won't do anything to your game (and the amount
will appear normal when you're purchasing items from a shop).


GAIN LOTS OF EXPERIENCE POINTS FROM BATTLES             8009BF70 - FFFF
submitted by <erwind@sby.mega.net.id>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With this code turned on, you'll win much more EXP. from enemies than
you would normally.  You don't need to use this code to keep your new
exp. levels, either, since you can save them into the game just as if
you had earned them normally.  I wonder how the 'Experience Up' materia
would affect this code?


GAIN LOTS OF ABILITY POINTS FROM BATTLES                8009BF74 - 0FFF
submitted by <erwind@sby.mega.net.id>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This works pretty much like the above code; simply turn it on and when
you win a battle, you'll always earn a ton of ability points (AP),
usually 4000-8000 points per battle.  You can save your game normally
to keep any materia orbs that you've mastered or leveled-up, too, so you
don't have to keep using this code.  If you affix a Materia Orb to a
weapon that increases the rate at which a materia levels-up (such as
Cloud's Apocalypse weapon), then you'll gain double or triple the amount
of AP that you would normally.

A special thanks to Deuce <deuce@scsn.net> for discovering that if you
change the code to 8009BF74 - 8FFF, you will gain far more AP per battle
(around 36800 points) than you would normally.

THE CHARACTERS
=========================================================================

Who's going to help Cloud fight against the Shin-Ra?  Read on to discover
friends (maybe even foes) who hook up with Cloud as the game progresses.

AERITH GAINSBOROUGH  (22 years old)
A beautiful woman with a mysterious atmosphere.  She met Cloud when she
was selling flowers in (Midgar, and now she plays an important role in
Cloud's adventure.  She is better at magic attacks than attacking with
weapons.


BARETT WALLACE  (35 years old)
The leader of "Avalanche".  His overwhelming power and a gun made
especially for him would destroy anything.  He lost his wife in the
past and now lives for his little daughter, Marin.


CAIT SITH  (age unknown)
No one knows where he is from.  The way he talks lets us guess he is a
male being.  He gives life to the fat stuffed animal of Moogle and rides
its back.  His attacks during the battle are worth seeing; it is as
though everything in a toy box were coming out.  Fortune telling is his
hobby, but what he says is never reliable.


CID HIWIND  (32 years old)
A pilot who dreams like a boy.  In the sky or on the water, no one steers
better than him.  He is dreaming of traveling the endless starry sky.  A
man always willing to face danger with a lance in his hand.  He also has
an amazing knowledge of mechanics.


CLOUD STRIFE  (21 years old)
A former soldier of Shin-Ra.  He is now a member of the rebel force
"Avalanche", and is getting involved with battles that would decide the
fate of the planet.  There is nothing that his sword would not destroy.


RED XIII  (age unknown)
Sex unknown.  Red XIII has decidedly red fur and looks threatening, but
has an intelligence level that is well beyond that of humans.  The only
thing known about Red XIII is that it attacks the enemy with its claws
and fangs.  A very mysterious beast.


SEPHIROTH  (age unknown)
He was also a Shin-Ra soldier, and Cloud was under him.  Only Shin-Ra's
confidential files know his past.  He was one of the best soldiers
there.  His long sword has an incredible power, and he is the only one
who can use it.  No one knows where he is now.


TIFA ROCKHEART*  (20 years old)
An optimist who encourages the members of the party.  Despite her cute
appearance, she is a real martial arts fighter who only uses her fists.
She is also an important member of "Avalanche".  She has known Cloud
since they were small and has feelings for him but still cannot tell
him so.

* It may be 'Lockheart', for all I know.


VINCENT VALENTINE  (27 years old)
A guy with a dark, mysterious atmosphere.  It seems that the past
relation with Shin-Ra is making him travel with Cloud and others.
It is known that his slim body possesses some kind of amazing power
and abilities.


YUFFIE KISARAGI  (16 years old)
She is a member of a Ninja family with long history, but she does not
care much about it.  She decided to join Cloud's party only because she
wanted to get "something".  She is a clever, selfish girl, but plays an
important role in battles by using her Ninja tricks and skills.


=========================================================================
MATERIA ORBS*
=========================================================================

As you play the game, you'll find, buy, and be given Materia Orbs.  When
equipped, these orbs have various functions (like Relics from FF3), and
become stronger as you use them (like the Classes from FF5j).  There are
five types of Materia:

        Green   -       Spell Materia.  When equipped, you can cast
                        spells like Thunder, Fire, Cure, Barrier, etc.
        Yellow  -       Command Materia.  These give you the ability
                        to Steal, Throw, Mimic, etc.
        Purple  -       Independent Materia.  These will increase
                        your scores, like Max HP or Speed.
        Blue    -       Support Materia.  These augment the power
                        of certain other Materia.  For instance,
                        the 'Select All' Materia, when combined with
                        a Flame materia, lets you cast a fire spell on
                        all foes.
        Red     -       Summon Materia.  These let you summon monsters,
                        like Chocobo, Shiva, Bahamut, or even Chupon!

* My tv has some strange color properties.  This means that when I
  mention a 'Purple Materia', it may actually be a Blue Materia.  I
  didn't even realize this until after first releasing this FAQ, so
  try and bear with me, okay?  I'll avoid incorrect naming in the
  future, but I may still get it wrong sometimes.  Sorry! ^_^;

You can equip Materia from the Main Menu, and mix and match them in
any way you want.  This is how they work:

Weapons and bracelets have a certain number of 'holders' on them.  You
can equip one Materia per holder.  So, if a sword has one holder and a
bracelet has five holders, you can equip six Materia in all.  The benefit
to equipping a Materia is the skills/magic/etc. it gives you.  The bad
part is that equipping Materia tends to lower your statistics.  While
this is only temporary, you'll have to decide if you value skills or
scores more when equipping certain Materia.  To restore your stats. to
normal, simply unequip the Materia you're using.  You'll notice that
some holders aren't connected, and some are (it looks something like
this: 0=0 ).  Connected holders are used to couple an Independent
Materia with another Materia, since Independent Materia have no effect
on their own.

When you win a battle, you gain AP (Ability Points).  Each Materia has
a number of stars, representing its' 'levels'.  All Materia start off
at level 1, but can be increased to their max. level.  The more level
stars a Materia has, the stronger and more useful it becomes.  To
gain a star level, you have to gain a certain number of Ability Points,
just like raising levels or learning Esper magic (in FF3).  However,
only Materia that you have equipped earn AP.  Luckily, that Materia has
the same number of points no matter who uses it.  For example, let's
say Cloud keeps the Summon Chocobo materia equipped for a long time,
and manages to raise it to level 2.  If Barett, who's never worn that
Materia before, equips it, he can also use it at level 2 strength.  When
you do 'master' a Materia (by gaining all its' levels), you will
instantly get another Materia of the same type!  Even though it will
begin at level 1 (i.e. unused), this means that you can have as many
Ultima or Summon Bahamut materia as you want (for example), providing
you max out the ones you already have beforehand.  Be sure to sell off
Materia that you don't need; if you have a full Materia list with no
empty places and you master a materia that you have equipped, it will
appear in a random location on the list, permanently erasing the Materia
that was in it's place (guess the programmers at Square never bothered
to check that out, did they?)

You'll want to be careful if you have more than one of the same Materia,
because you have to raise them seperately.  And there's no point in
giving two of the same Materia to the same person!  Try to figure out
what Materia works best with which person (i.e. give the MAX MP up
Materia to a good magic-user, and give the Certain Kill materia to a
character with low normal attack power).  Also, take note of the way
the holders look; if they don't have silver dots in them (like this:
O=O or just O), then you can still equip Materia, but you can't level-
up them since none of the AP you gain in battles will be distributed to
the Materia in that weapon or item.  The tradeoff is that such equipment
is usually very strong.


=========================================================================
HUGE MATERIA / MASTER MATERIA
=========================================================================

From Disc 2 onwards, you have the chance to find and collect four 'Huge
Materia'.  They can be gotten from these locations:

Blue Materia   - North Corel.  You have to save the town from being
                 destroyed by a train during Disc 2.

Yellow Materia - The other Huge Materia is located in the Condor Fort--
                 you can only get this during Disc 2.  What you have to
                 do is win the 'mini-battle' sequence atop the tower or
                 you won't receive the Huge Materia.

Green Materia* - Rocket Town.  After you and Cid blast off in his ship,
                 you'll have to enter the code command to free the huge
                 Green Materia.  If you can't save the Materia, it's lost
                 for good.  This quest can only be done during Disc 2.

Red Materia    - Red Submarine.  If you were able to sink the red sub
                 during the return trip to Junon Town in Disc 2, you can
                 capture the huge Red Materia from the sunken submarine
                 at any time during Discs 2 or 3.  If you weren't able
                 to stop the sub, then this Materia is permanently lost.

* In one game, I tried beating every quest but Corel.  I had three of
the materia, Yellow, Green, and Red.  I always thought the Blue Materia
was part of the Rocket Town sub-quest, but I guess not.

While you have to get two of the Huge Materia in order to make the game
progress during Disc 2, you don't need to collect all four of them.
However, you can get the powerful 'Master Materia' from the Huge Materia,
as well as the strongest Bahamut summon materia, 'Bahamut Form Zero', so
it's advisable that you try to find them all.  You can receive the
following materia from each Huge Materia:

NAME                DESCRIPTION              PREREQUISITES
Master Magic        Cast any magic spell     Huge Green materia and a
                                             'master' level for all 21
                                             magic materia.

Master Command      Use most commands        Huge Yellow materia and a
                                             'master' level for seven
                                             command materia (see below).

Master Summon       Use all summon spells    Huge Red materia and a
                                             'master' level for all 16
                                             summon materia.

Bahamut Form Zero   A summon materia         Huge Blue materia and the
                                             Bahamut and Bahamut Reborn
                                             summon materia orbs.

Once you've fulfilled the prerequisites to get a certain master materia,
simply return to Buugen Haagen's observatory in Cosmo Canyon and touch
the correct Huge Materia (I hope you have the Huge Materia on you/have
already taken it to the observatory in Cosmo Canyon beforehand!)  Pick
the first option and the screen will glow; pick the top option to get
your master materia or the bottom option if you want to get that
particular master materia later.  You do have to have all the mastered
materia on hand, but it doesn't matter whether they're equipped or not.

If you're trying to get Bahamut Form Zero, then all you have to do is
touch the huge blue materia and you'll automatically receive it after
choosing the first option; you have to get this summon spell before you
can receive the Master Summon materia.  There's good news and bad news,
though:

 - All of the Master materia do not have level stars, so you can't
   simply 'master' them and get a second Master Materia.  Wearing
   one doesn't effect your statistics, either (so all of you who
   were hoping for a 'MAX MP +80%' or something like that will be
   disappointed!)

 - When you receive a Master materia, you lose all the materia that
   you mastered.  This means that not only will you be left with a
   bunch of low-level materia (since you get another materia of the
   same type when you master it, remember?), but you'll have to master
   each of them if you want to get a second Master materia of that
   type.  The good news is that if you have two mastered orbs of the
   same type (say, two Flames and you're trying to get the Master
   Magic materia), you'll only lose one and keep the other.  So, if
   you have two mastered Kujata materia and you get a Master Summon
   materia and want another one, you'll only have to level-up 15 orbs
   instead of 16 since one is already mastered.

Individual notes on the Master materia:

 - If you affix a combination materia like Affect All or Random Magic
   Strike to the Master Magic orb, it will affect all the spells!
   However, not all combination materia work with each spell.

 - When you master a Summon materia, you can call a particular summoned
   beast five times.  With the Master Summon materia equipped, you can
   summon any beast an infinite number of times (providing you have the
   MP for it)!  Like the Master Magic materia, Combination materia
   attached to this orb will affect all summon spells.

 - You only have to master the Steal, See Through, Throw, Metamorphosis,
   Certain Kill, Manipulate and Mimicry materia orbs in order to get the
   Master Command materia.  This may sound good, but then again, all you
   get are the above abilities of those materia: this orb won't let you
   use other commands like Swordplay, Double Item, Techniques of the
   Enemy, or Continuous Slice, for example (but you can equip these
   seperately, if you like).

 - And of course, there are no Master Combination or Master Independant
   Materia :)


=========================================================================
MATERIA LIST
=========================================================================

This section lists each Materia and explains it's abilities and other
information.  A new addition to this section is 'AP to Master': this
tells you how many AP you will need to master that materia.  It's easy
enough to check your current AP level in the Main Menu, but you can't
figure out what the master amount of AP is until you're at the next
to the last level--the reason for this addition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name in Japanese

Levels: Translated Name*    MP Cost    Effect when used

Changes to status when Materia is equipped:

Who has it when they first join you:
Where you can buy it from:            (may change depending on what Disc
                                      you're currently on)
Where you can find it at:             (* anything else you should know)

* The translated name is often not the exact Japanese equivalent, but
  rather, what the _intended_ meaning is.  For example, the -ra and
  -ga endings to some of the spells don't actually mean anything aside
  from denoting the strength of the spell.  Because numbers were used
  in previous American FF games, I use '2' or '3' in the FAQ, although
  that isn't exactly a 'by the book' translation.  For more details,
  please refer to the 'Translations' section.

   seasoning on you (buy it for 1500 gil from the Chocobo Farm; it's the
   same one you use to learn Chocobockle; the 5th item from the top).
   Choose the top option when you examine the chocobo, then choose the

   can still do it even after the town is partially destroyed.

*3 Berserk is useful against magic-casting enemies because they're
   forced to attack and can't use spells.  You can also use this
   spell on yourself; while the ally can do nothing but attack, his
   attack power is greatly increased (but this is true for enemies
   hit with this spell, too).

*5 Reflect reflects a magic spell to the opposite party (foe to ally, ally
   to foe) even if the caster and receiver are both allies or enemies.
   If a spell affects more than one person, only the people with Reflect
   will have the spell reflected.

   Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, a reflected spell (at least, if
   the reflective power is automatic or due to an accessory like the
   Reflect Ring) will bounce back and forth until it 'breaks through'
   a target's reflectiveness (which will still be there--it's not
   permanently removed) or misses.  This is quite a change from the
   normal 'reflect one time' rule of other FF incarnations, and whether
   it was programmed in purposely or is a glitch remains to be seen.

   Riflek doesn't work against Juuryoku-type spells, Inseki-type spells,
   Ultima, Shield, Debarrier, or Dispel.

LV1: NAGERU  (Throw)  
     You can throw one of the weapons in your inventory at an enemy.
     You'll lose the weapon you throw, however.  The only items you're
     allowed to throw are: swords (Cloud), rods (Aerith), cannons
     (Barett), shuriken (Yuffie), megaphones (Cait Sith), handguns
     (Vincent), and spears (Cid).  You cannot throw a weapon an ally
     is equipped with.

LV2: ZENINAGE  (Coin Toss)  
     Once you learn it, this command and Nageru switch constantly while
     the Battle Window is open.  If you choose it, you must then decide
     how much money you will _keep_ by using the controller (just like
     purchasing a certain amount of items).  No matter how much gil you
     toss, the maximum damage is always 9999.  The ratio of gil to
     damage points is 10:1, so you'd better have a lot of money.

This command makes you do a physical attack at roughly 2/3rds less
damage.  If your foe is killed with this hit, he will transform into an
item for you to take.  Not all enemies can be morphed.

HISSATSU  (Certain Kill)                        40000 AP          2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


When used, an ally will try to make a critical strike.  This attack
misses often, but still hits more frequently than a regular critical
attack does.

AYATSURU  (Manipulate)                          40000 AP          2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can control an enemy with this command.  If it works, your character
can't do anything aside from controlling the enemy.  Not all enemies can
be controlled, and on top of that, this command doesn't always work.
While an enemy is under your command, you can do nothing aside from
direct it (you can't perform normal commands, only pick commands for the
monster under your control).  If you're using this materia and Subete
Zentaika, you'll attempt to control all monsters, but you can only
control one, no matter how successful you are :(

TEKI NO WAZA  (Techniques of the Enemy)         n/a              24 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can learn certain skills normally available only to your enemies
with this materia equipped.  To learn a skill, the enemy must use it
on you (even if you dodge it or are killed by it), and you must then
proceed to win the battle.  Each time you gain a new skill, one of the
24 stars in the Materia Menu lights up and the skill's name is added
to the gray box beneath it.  Using enemy skills costs MP, in most cases.
You can also check out Enemy Skills in the Magic Menu.

MONOMANE  (Mimicry)                             100000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can mimic the last action one of your allies made when using this
command, whether it was spell-casting, using up an item, activating a
Command Materia, summoning a monster, changing rows, etc.  You won't
lose any HP, MP, items, or anything else that would be used up or
depleted normally.  Since Monomane mimics the last action made, you can
skip through the other allies until it is your turn again to repeatedly
imitate yourself.  And while you can't mimic Limit Breaks, you can
imitate your own Breaks.  What's really cool about this materia is that
you will imitate the person's combination materia, too.  So if someone
casts Faira, and it's combined with Mahou Midareuchi, then you will
use Mahou Midareuchi as well when you mimic them without having to have
it equipped!

W MAHOU  (Double Magic)                         250000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This command lets you cast two spells, one right after the other.  MP
consumption remains normal and you have to have enough for both spells.
The great thing about this materia is that you can still use Mahou
Midareuchi, Zentaika, Subete Zentaika, MP Turbo, or any other materia
that affects magic along with this to affect both spells that you're
casting.

W SHOUKAN  (Double Summon)                      250000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can summon two monsters, one right after the other, when this Materia
is equipped.  You have to have enough MP to perform the summons, and if
you've already called a monster the maximum number of times, you can't
call it again using this command.

You must have enough items to use, though.

PURPLE - INDEPENDENT MATERIA
============================

Note that when more than one of the following Materia are worn, their
bonus is culmulative:  HP Up, MP Up, Lucky, Magical, and Speed.  This
means that you can wear more than one for an even higher increase in
your scores (but you can only wear so many--try to equip lots of the
same type of Materia and you'll see that your stats. remain the same.
The rest of the Purple Materia (Gil Up, Teki Yose, etc.) have no
additional effect of two or more of them are worn at once.  The only
exception is when you wear the Counter Materia; see below for details.

LV1: HP 10% Up       When equipped, your Maximum HP increases by the
LV2: HP 20% Up       listed amount, allowing you to gain back more HP.
LV3: HP 30% Up       Your HP cannot be raised above 9999, though, and you
LV4: HP 40% Up       lose your HP bonus when this materia is de-equipped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


LV1: MP 10% Up       When worn, your Maximum MP increases by the listed
LV2: MP 20% Up       amount, allowing you to gain back more MP.  Your MP
LV3: MP 30% Up       cannot be raised above 999, though, and you lose the
LV4: MP 40% Up       MP bonus when this materia is taken off.

MPMP IREKAE  (HP/MP Replace)                    80000 AP          2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This materia switches your maximum HP score with your maximum MP score.
While this allows you to have up to 9999 MP, your HPs can never go
beyond 999 while wearing this materia.  Interestingly enough, equipping
an 'HP Up' materia will increase your MP amount (up to 9999), and
wearing a 'MP Up' materia will increase your maximum HP (but you still
can't go beyond 999 Hit Points).

LV1: Luck 10% Up     This materia raises your luck score (which helps
LV2: Luck 20% Up     determine your critical hit (Hissatsu) rate.  If

LV1: Magic 10% Up    This materia raises your magic score (which helps
LV2: Magic 20% Up    rate the effectiveness of Mahou materia).  When
LV3: Magic 30% Up    de-equipped, your magic score returns to normal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


LV1: Speed 10% Up    This materia increases your speed rating (which
LV2: Speed 20% Up    determines, in part, battle initiative and your
LV3: Speed 30% Up    ability to dodge attacks).  Should this materia
LV4: Speed 40% Up    be taken off, your speed will go back to it's
LV5: Speed 50% Up    former level.

ENKYORI KOUGEKI  (Long Distance Attack)         80000 AP          2 stars

You may attack from the back row without any reduction in your attack
power.  This materia has no effect if you are in the front row.

Find:                In the Mithril Mine.

KABAU  (Protect)                                40000 AP          5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


LV1: 20% Up          The character wearing this Materia will block
LV2: 40% Up          an enemy's attack by standing in front of one of
LV3: 60% Up          his allies when they are attacked.  It won't
LV4: 80% Up          always happen (unless you're at 100%), and that
LV5: 100% Up         ally will keep guarding even if his HPs are low.
                     This only works when another ally is hit by a
                     physical attack, not by magic or certain enemy
                     abilties.

KAUNTAA  (Counter)                              100000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


The character wearing this will counterattack using his weapon if he is
targeted by an enemy (the attack doesn't have to be physical, and it
doesn't have to be aimed specifically at the person wearing the Counter
Materia.  In fact, it doesn't even have to hit or do damage in order
to trigger a counterattack).  Damage is the same, just as if you had
attacked normally (it's even possible to miss).

A counterattack is made only against the enemy you hit; combining this
materia with Subete Zentaika, Renzokugiri, or any other materia that
affects your ability to attack will have no effect.  However, I'm not
sure how Enkyori Kougeki would affect this materia.  The chance of you
countering when hit raises at 20% per star.  You won't counterattack
your friends if they attack you, BTW.

Note that the more of these that you wear, the more times you make a
counterattack.  So if you have 4 Counter materia equipped and an enemy
hits you with a physical attack, you will strike that foe 4 times.

Find:                Caves behind Nivelheim, or you can receive it as a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBETE ZENTAIKA  (Everything Affect All)        160000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like Zentaika, this materia allows you to target all allies or enemies
instead of just one.  However, the Subete Zentaika affects _every_
ability your character possesses.  The ability must be a selectable one
(in the Battle Window), and not an ability such as Counter or Cover.
This Materia doesn't work with Summon Spells or the ability to use Items
(even with W Item equipped).

Every time you hit an enemy with magic, 1/10th of the damage you did is
given back to you in the form of MPs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


When paired with a Mahou or Summon materia, the MP cost raises by about
1/3rd the original amount.  However, the effectiveness of the spell cast
is increased by a third as well, whether it is damaged inflicted or HP
restored.  The only exception to this that I've found so far is the
Knights of the Round materia--pair it to MP Turbo and the cost raises
only 5 points, yet the amount of damage is still raised by a third.

Find:                In the Temple.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZENTAIKA  (Affect Everybody)                    35000 AP          5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


When linked to a green materia, you will target that spell on all allies
or enemies instead of just one.  This allows you to hit them all with
that spell.  The more levels you raise this materia, the more times you
can do this; after enough uses of that spell, you'll have to target
one enemy again until the next battle.  Note that Zentaika will not work
with the following materia: Altema, Chiryou (Resist only), Fulkea, Fuuin,
Inseki, Ridatsu, or Shield.

Initially Equipped:  Red 13

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAHOU MIDAREUCHI  (Random Magic Strike)         200000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This can be combined with Spell or Summon Materia.  When used, the spell
strikes 4 times, with the target randomly chosen each time.  The damage
that spell would inflict is reduced, but the you only lose MP as if you
had casted the spell once.  The same applies if it is combined with a
Summon Materia.  This Materia works with every magic spell and summon
skill except for Escape and Knights of the Round.

Find:                One of the bonus areas...refer to section 5b.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUIUCHI  (Surprise Attack)                      150000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you have a Mahou, Summon, or Command materia attached to the Fuiuchi
materia, then the character wearing them will instantly use the
attached materia before the allies or enemies can attack.  However,
there is only a small chance of this working, but you can increase it
by raising this materia's levels.  This materia doesn't work against
enemies that are supposed to attack first (such as the armored tank
that you fight after escaping from Shinra HQ in Disc One).

MAHOU KAUNTAA  (Magic Counter)                  300000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Despite it's name, you can attach a Mahou or a Summon materia to this
materia orb.  If you are attacked, there is a chance that you will
counterattack with whatever spell or Shoukan you have equipped, providing
you have the MP for it.  The chance of you making a counterattack
increases 20% per level star you earn.  If you have either the Master
Magic or Master Summon materia equipped, the Shoukanjuu or magic spell
used is determined randomly.

Find:                Receive as a prize if you did well in the chocobo
                     races at the Gold Saucer.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
KOMANDO KAUNTAA  (Command Counter)              100000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This materia will only work if it is attached to a Command Materia.
Furthermore, it will will only work with the following Materia:
Ayatsuru, Henka, Hissatsu, Miyaburu, Monomane*, Nageru, and Nusumu.
If you have the Master Command materia linked to this one, then one of
the eight commands will be picked at random.  When you are attacked by
an enemy, you will counterattack with the command materia you have
equipped.  The chance of you counterattacking increases by 20% for each
new level star you earn.  If the command chosen is Nageru or Zeninage,
then the item thrown/amount of gil thrown is randomly determined.

* Since Monomane will make you imitate what you or your allies just did,
  you can use Monomane to counterattack with Renzokugiri, a Summon
  spell, or any other Materia ability.  It's probably the best Materia
  to have when using the Command Counter because you can strike back
  with just about any ability you can think of.

Find:                Makou Pit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAINARU ATTAKU  (Final Attack)                  160000 AP         5 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This works just like the ability that many of your enemies have; when
your HP is reduced to 0, you will activate whatever Materia is attached
to the Final Attack Materia, but that Materia has to be a Mahou, Shoukan,
or Command materia.  Be careful, though, since if one of your allies
kills you, you'll attack them with the Materia you have equipped!  You
can equip a Materia like Sosei or Barrier to revive yourself or protect
your party once you pass away, though, making this useful as both an
offensive and defensive tactic.  The more stars you've earned, the more
times you can use this Materia when you are killed.

Find:                A prize you can win at the Gold Saucer's Battle

TSUIKAGIRI  (Additional Slice)                  200000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


After using the materia that this is combined with, you'll perform a
single physical attack on the enemy affected by the materia.  This means
that if you use a materia on yourself (like Barrier), you'll attack
yourself or your allies!

Find:                Look on the 'switching path' in the Mountain
                     Crossroads area (it's where you can use your map
                     in the 2nd disk, just before the snowfield).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TSUIDENI NUSUMU  (Steal in Addition*)           200000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


After using the materia that this is combined with, you'll attempt to
steal from the enemy affected by the previous materia (you won't move
or anything--you simply receive a message telling you if you were
successful or not).  Combining this with the Nusumu materia is obviously
pointless unless you're having a hard time stealing from a particular
foe.

Find:                In a cavern above Uutai (you need to be able to
                     cross the fire-pits before you can reach it).

*  Could also be translated 'Steal while you are doing (action)'.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TSUIKA KOUKA   (Additional Effect)              100000 AP         2 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


This materia is affect not only by which Mahou or Shoukan materia you
combine it with, but if you affix it to your weapon or your bracelet.
It takes the properties of the linked materia and gives your weapon or
bracelet those properties.  For example, equip Shiva on your paired
bracelet holders and you are protected from Ice damage.  Equip it and
the Ikazuchi materia on your weapon's holders and your normal attacks
will hit for lightning damage.  Like Zokusei (below), not all materia
will work with this combination materia.

Find:                Cosmo Canyon -- the cave that you and the old man
                     explore.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZOKUSEI  (Attribute)                            80000 AP          4 stars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like Tsuika Kouka, this materia affects the weapon or armor it is
attached to as well as the materia it is combined with.  Zokusei only
works when paired with certain Mahou or Shoukan materia.  If it is
attached to a weapon, the type of damage you inflict is the same as the
Materia combined with Zokusei (so if you have Phoenix attached to your
weapon and it is combined with this materia, you'll hit for fire damage.
And if you have Doku attached to you armor along with this materia, you
will be protected from Poison attacks).  This Materia has no additional
power when linked with a weapon, but if it is combined with a bracelet,
it has the following abilities:

LV1: Damage inflicted is reduced to 1/2 if it is the corresponding type.
LV2: No damage is received if it is the corresponding type.
LV3: Gain HP if you are struck with the corresponding type of attack.

Zokusei will only work when paired with these materia:

MAHOU MATERIA        SHOUKAN MATERIA
Doku                 Alexander        Titan
Honou                Ifrit            Ramuh
Ikazuchi             Leviathan
Juuryoku             Phoenix
Reiki                Shiva

Find:                From Domino on the 62nd floor of the Shinra HQ.
                     Also in either Tifa's house or the mountains
                     behind Nivelheim (NSS).


====================
RED - SUMMON MATERIA
====================

All summon materia have five level stars.  The more levels you raise,
the more times you can summon that particular Shoukanjuu (Summoned
Beast) during a battle.  Unless mentioned, all summon attacks strike
all enemies at once.

ENEMY SKILL LIST
=========================================================================

This section lists the enemy skills you can learn in numerical order.
It also lists the amount of MP needed to use an enemy skill, the effect
of that skill, and the locations of monsters you can learn them from.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 01 - KAERU NO UTA  (Song of the Frog)                COST - 5 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Transforms all foes into frogs and puts them to sleep.
Learn:   From the green frogs (Tatchimi) in the circular forest near
         Gongaga Town (also from the other forests nearby).  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     You can control the enemy and make it use Kaeru no Uta on you
         (pick the bottom option).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 02 - LEVEL 4 JIBAKU  (Level 4 Self-Destruct)         COST - 10 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  All enemies with an experience level that is a multiple of 4
         loses almost all their HP (you can't kill an enemy with this
         spell--the best you can do is reduce their HP to one point).
         In addition, they may be afflicted with the 'Minimum' status.
Learn:   Burrowing squirrel-like foes (Muu) found near the Chocobo Farm.
         <Disc 1+>
Tip:     You can't control this enemy, so you'll have to wait until they
         use it on you.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 03 - MAJIKKUHANMAA  (Magic Hammer)                   COST - 3 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Bop one foe on the head and gain up to 100 MP (assuming
         the monster has enough MP).
Learn:   Plant-like monsters (Ashigirisou)  found on the tip of the
         Westernmost Continent (in the dark grass).  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     You can control an Ashigiisou and have it use the Magic
         Hammer against one of your allies (choose the third
         option).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 04 - HOWAITOUINDO  (White Wind)                      COST - 34 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Each ally regains lost HP and their status ailments are cured
         and dispelled.  The amount of HP recovered depends on the
         current HP of the caster.
Learn:   The white and green cactus-like monsters (Zemzerett) in the
         grassy area by Junon Town  <Disc 1+>, or from the winged
         serpents you fight if you're hit by a barrier at the Frozen
         Mountain.  <Disc 2>
Tip:     You can't learn White Wind from a Zemzerett unless you control
         it and make it use the skill on you (pick the bottom choice to
         do this).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 05 - MAITIGAADO  (Mighty Guard)                      COST - 56 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Has the same effect as casting Haste, Barrier, and Mabarrier on
         all your allies.
Learn:   The spiky, shelled creatures with green tentacles (Beach Plug)
         that live on the shore near the Gongaga Town.  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     The Beach Plug won't use Mighty Guard unless you control it
         and make it use the skill on one of your members (it's the
         middle option).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 06 - TENSHI NO SASAYAKI  (Angel's Whisper)           COST - 50 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  An angel appears above one person and brings them back to life
         if they are dead.  They also relieve any status ailments and
         dispel any bad effects.  In addition HP is restored to the
         amount shown during the skill's use; however, this can be a
         bane to characters with high HP because if your life is higher
         than the amount shown, it is reduced to that amount.  You'd
         think that this would be a great way to weaken enemies with
         more than 9999 HP, but it won't work on your opponents in this
         manner--it will only heal them, remove status ailments, etc. :(
Learn:   From the beckoning women in the yellow swimsuits (Polan Solita)
         you meet in the Makou Pit if you take the right path the first
         time you meet your friends.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     The easiest way to learn this skill is by controlling your
         enemy and picking the bottom option to make them use this skill
         on you.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 07 - DORAGONFOOSU  (Dragon Force)                    COST - 19 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Increases your physical and magical defense rating.
Learn:   From the dragons (Dark Dragon) you meet during the descent into
         the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     You can't learn this unless you control the Dark Dragon and have
         it use Dragon Force on one of you (pick the second choice).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 08 - DESUFOOSU  (Death Force)                        COST - 3 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  One ally becomes immune to instant death attacks (this doesn't
         protect you from dying if you lose all your HP).
Learn:   The huge tusked turtles (Adamantaimai) by the shoreline of the
         Westmost Continent.  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     You can't learn this skill unless you control the turtle and
         make it use Death Force against you.  To do this, choose the
         bottom option once it's under your control.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 09 - KAEN HOUSHA  (Flame Blaster)                    COST - 10 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A stream of fire burns one foe for fire (Honoo) damage.
Learn:   From any enemy that utilizes a fire breath attack. One of the
         earliest locations would be the room with the ladders and
         pipes where you fight the boss of the mountains behind
         Nivelheim; you can fight Dragons in that area that use Kaen
         Housha often.  <Disc 1+>  You can also learn it from the
         flying yellow monsters (Aakudoragon) in the Mithril Mine.
Tip:     While you could learn this skill by controlling a Dragon and
         picking the bottom choice to make it use this skill on you,
         chances are it will hit you with Kaen Housha as it's initial
         attack in the first place.  The same goes for the flying
         Aakudoragons.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 10 - REEZAA  (Laser)                                 COST - 16 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Reduces an enemy's HP by one-half.
Learn:   From the dragons (Dark Dragon) you meet during the descent into
         the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     You can either let the Dark Dragon use this ability on you, or
         you can control it (using Ayatsuru), and pick the top option
         to make it use Laser on one of your allies.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 11 - MATORAMAJIKKU  (Matora Magic)                   COST - 8 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Fire a pack of missiles at one enemy for magic damage.
Learn:   Machines with big feet and guns for arms (Sweeper Custom) around
         Junon Town.  <Disc +1>  Or from the wheeled robo-creatures in
         the underwater part of Junon Town.  <Disc 2>
Tip:     To learn this skill from the Sweeper Custom, just control it
         and choose the last option.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 12 - KUSAI IKI  (Smelly Breath)                      COST - 58 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Inflict multiple status ailments upon all enemies, including
         Confusion, Frog, Minimum (Shrink), Mute, Poison, and Sleep.
Learn:   From the Mobol creatures (green guys with tentacles and really
         big mouths) living on the outside ledges in the Frozen Mountain.
         <Disc 2>  You can also meet them in the Makou Pit, if you take
         the right path the first time you run into your friends.
         <Disc 3>
Tip:     Be sure to have some protective accessories equipped when trying
         to learn this skill or your party may be too weakened by the
         Smelly Breath to kill the Molbol or even escape!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 13 - BEETA  (Beta)                                   COST - 35 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A swirling red shape appears, surrounded by specks of white.
         All targets are hit for magic damage.
Learn:   The big shadow snake (Midgal Zuolm) in the marsh near the
         Chocobo Farm.  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     This monster won't use Beta unless he's waving back and forth.
         To make him do that, inflict heavy damage on him.  Then just
         wait until he uses Beta.  If he still doesn't use it, take off
         a little bit of his life since he tends to use Beta more when
         he's near death.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 14 - AKUABURESU  (Aqua Breath)                       COST - 34 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Blue bubbles strike all enemies for water damage.
Learn:   From the boss of the Ancient City  <Disc 1>, the winged chimera
         in the plains surrounding the Gold Saucer  <Disc 1+>; or from
         the floating sea-dragon creature (Saapando) in the sunken plane
         near the Gold Saucer.  <Disc 2-3>
Tip:     To pick up this skill, just control a Chimera and choose the
         bottom option to make it use Aqua Breath.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 15 - TORAIN  (Tryne)                                 COST - 20 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A Delta Force-like attack that hits all enemies for lighting
         (Ikazuchi) damage.
Learn:   The Ashura-like boss (Godo) of the pagoda's top floor in Utai.
         <Disc 1+>  Also from the red spider/crab-like creature (Stilve)
         living inside the Frozen Mountain <Disc 2>, or the spider-like
         boss (Materia Keeper) of the mountains behind Nivelheim.  <Disc
         1>.  Remember, the _only_ time you can learn this skill is while
         fighting one of the above monsters, so learn it while you still
         can!  If you miss it, it's possible to learn it from the Stilves
         you meet in the Gold Saucer's Battle Square, though -NSS-.
Tip:     Actually, the Materia Keeper is more likely to use this against
         your characters than any other enemy that can use this skill.
         It's a good thing, too, since you can't control it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 16 - MAJIKARUBURESU  (Magical Breath)                COST - 75 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Rainbow orbs hit all foes for fire, ice, and lighting damage.
Learn:   From the red spider/crab-like creatures (Stilve) living inside
         the Frozen Mountain.  <Disc 2>  Also from the blue, leech-like
         enemies (Parasite) in the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     To learn this skill from a Parasite quickly, control it and
         pick the last option to have it use Magical Breath on your
         allies.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 17 - ????                                            COST - 3 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A weight drops and hits for special damage.  The amount is
         equal to the amount of damage the caster has received in
         battle.
Learn:   From the balance-like creatures (Judge) in Nivelheim.  <Disc 1+>
         Also from the purple behemoths (Behemoth) you encounter when
         raiding Midgar City.  <Disc 2>  Keep in mind that you won't
         actually learn this skill unless you take damage from it.
Tip:     The Judges will use this skill eventually.  You can't control
         them, but they're easier to run into than the Behemoths.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 18 - GOBURIN PANCHI  (Goblin Punch)                  COST - 0 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  One foe is hit for physical damage.  The damage inflicted is
         multiplied if your opponent has the same EXP level that you
         do.
Learn:   Imp-like monsters wearing boxing gloves :) (Goblin) found on the
         only forested island in the northeast area of the map.  <Disc
         2-3>
Tip:     You can control the Goblins if you want (pick the middle option
         to use the Goblin Punch), but it's more likely that they'll hit
         you with it in the first place, so don't even bother and just
         let them strike first.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 19 - CHOKOBOKKURE  (Chocobockle)                     COST - 3 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A fat chocobo bounces around and hits one foe for special
         damage.  This attack gains strength each time you flee from a
         battle.
Learn:   Go to the Chocobo Farm.  Talk to the man in the barn and choose
         the first choice.  The 5th item from the top costs 1500 gil;
         purchase three of them.  Then go to the chocobo tracks on the
         Southern Continent near the forest.  Equip yourself with a
         Chocobo Yose materia.  When you encounter a chocobo, kill off
         all but one of the other enemies and use the item you bought 3
         of on the chocobo (it looks like an orange squash).  This will
         make the chocobo peck at the ground.  At any time after that
         point (whether or not the chocobo is still pecking), use the
         Level 4 Jibaku enemy skill and you'll be hit by the Chocobockle.
         <Disc 2-3>
Tip:     Make sure you're in the right location (the forest near Mideel);
         you can't learn this skill from any other type of Chocobo (these
         are the only ones who will be affected by Level 4 Jibaku).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 20 - REBERU 5 DESU  (Level 5 Death)                  COST - 22 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  Any enemy whose level is a multiple of 5 is instantly killed.
Learn:   From the blue, leech-like enemies (Parasite) in the Makou Pit.
         <Disc 3>
Tip:     Simply use Control to command your foe and then choose the
         middle option if you want the Parasite to use Level 5 Death
         on one of your members.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 21 - SHI NO SENKOKU  (Death Sentence)                COST - 10 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Effect:  One enemy is Condemned (they die when the counter over their
         head reaches zero).
Learn:   The yellow, spiked enemies (Bound Fat) that live in front of and
         in the area behind the Ancient City.  <Disc 1+>
Tip:     You could control these guys, but if you kill one it will
         counterattack with this skill so it may be easier to simply
         off one, especially if you don't have the Ayatsuru materia.  If
         you do, then simply control them and pick the bottom option to
         use the Death Sentence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 22 - SHI NO RUURETTO  (Roulette of Death)            COST - 6 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Effect:  One friend or foe is randomly killed.
Learn:   From the floating card-jesters (Death Dealer) in the Makou Pit
         if you take the right path the first time you meet your friends.
         <Disc 3>
Tip:     You can control the Death Dealer and make him use Shi no
         Roulette on you by picking the second option when the enemy
         abilities window appears.  If it kills one of your enemies,
         you'll have to try again until the pointer lands on you.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 23 - SHADOU FUREA  (Shadow Flare)                    COST - 100 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A black flare hits a single opponent for magic damage.
Learn:   From the flying black dragon in Disc 3; it uses it as a
         counterattack before dying.  Or, learn it from the Dragon
         Zombies in the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     If you're fighting the flying dragon, just kill it and it will
         use the Shadow Flare on you.  If you're trying to learn it from
         a Dragon Zombie, you'll have to wait until it uses it since you
         can't control them.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAR 24 - NANTOKA ???  (What???)                          COST - 110 MP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Effect:  A star field and question mark appear; hits all enemies for
         physical damage.
Learn:   From the huge, multi-limbed bone dragons (Dragon Zombie) in
         the Makou Pit if you take the right path the first time you
         meet your friends.  <Disc 3>
Tip:     As the Dragon Zombies are uncontrollable, you'll simply have
         to keep fighting them until they use this skill on one of
         your characters.

To learn an enemy skill, you must be equipped with a Teki no Waza (Learn
Enemy Skill) yellow materia.  When an enemy hits you with it's special
skill, you will learn it, even if it misses or kills you.  However,
unless you win the battle, you won't keep the skill you've learned.
There are 24 skills in all, and one of the 24 stars on the Materia Menu
will light up as you get more enemy skills.  Note that you can't learn
a skill and then have your player cast it on another person with a
Teki no Waza; they _must_ learn it from enemies.  You'll know if you
learned a skill because the character with the materia equipped will
spin in a circle once and you'll get a message ending in an exclamation
point.  Keep in mind that if you're controlling a monster to learn a
particular skill, you'll have to target the character wearing the Teki
no Waza in order to learn the skill.

For those of you who would like a more definitive guide, here is a list
that shows the earliest point at which you can learn each skill as you
play through the game:

DISC ONE  ---------------------------------------------------------------

Matora Magic     - from the Sweeper Customs after you've escaped from
                   Midgar City.
Level 4 Self-... - from the Muus in the area around the Chocobo Farm.
Beta             - from Midogaru Zuorumu, the snake you encounter after
                   reaching the Chocobo Farm.
Flame Blaster    - from the Aakudoragons in the Mithril Mine (I tried to
                   learn it from the Mootaabooru boss, but I couldn't
                   get it, so....)
White Wind       - from the Zemzeretts in the Junon Area (land between
                   the Condor Fort and Junon Town).
Aqua Breath      - use the Gold Saucer vehicle to get attacked by a
                   Chimera in the dirt pit around the Saucer.
Song of the Frog - the Tatchimis in the forests around Gongaga Town.
Mighty Guard     - the Beach Plugs on the shore near Gongaga Town.
????             - from the Judges in Sephiroth's Mansion in Nivelheim.
Tryne            - from the Materia Keeper boss of the Nivelheim
                   mountain range.
Death Force*     - from the Adamantaimais on the shores of the
                   Westermost Continent (once you have Cid's airplane).
Magic Hammer*    - from the Ashigiisous found in the dark, grassy areas
                   of the Westernmost Continent (just before entering
                   Utai).
Death Sentence   - from the Bound Fats found just before the Ancient
                   City.

* If Yuffie hasn't joined you yet, then you can get these skills without
  worry.  But if she has joined your party, then she'll steal all your
  Materia, preventing you from learning these two skills until after
  you've completed her sub-quest and gotten your Teki no Waza materia
  back (along with the rest of your materia).

DISC TWO  --------------------------------------------------------------

Smelly Breath    - from the Molbols while climbing up the Frozen
                   Mountain.
Magical Breath   - from the Stilves inside the Frozen Mountain.

Once you get the Highwind...

Chocobockle      - from the Chocobs found in the forest near Mideel.
Goblin Punch     - from the Goblins on the forested isle in the
                   northeast part of the World Map.

Death Roulette   - from the Death Dealers in the Makou Pit.
What???          - from the Dragon Zombies in the Makou Pit
                   (you can also learn Shadow Flare from them).

=========================================================================
LEARNING LIMIT BREAKS
=========================================================================

A lot of people don't know how the process to learn Limit Breaks works,
or they may not know how to learn all the Breaks.  Basically, the Limit
Break mastery process goes like this:

 - Breaks are divided into four levels of power, and most characters
   have two Breaks per level, excluding level four (you only have one
   break for that level).

 - Each ally starts out with his first Level 1 break, so you don't
   have to fret over learning it.

 - But when you want to learn the second Limit Break of that particular
   level, you have to use the first break approximately:

       Ten times to get your second Level 1 break
       Eight times to get your second Level 2 break
       Six times to get you second Level 3 break

   You don't have to do this all in one battle, but you do have to kill
   the enemy your Break affects (if it is an attacking type of Break),
   Also, you do have to win the battle, since the new Limit Break you
   learn appears in the 'EXP/AP Gained' screen, although you don't have
   to be the one to kill the last opponent, as long as you killed at
   least one enemy with a Break.  I'm a little unsure when it comes to
   non-attacking breaks...I think you just have to use them a certain
   number of times (see above).

 - Once you have your second Break, your goal is to reach the next
   level of power (and get that level's first Break in the process).
   To do this, your character has to win 40 battles _on his own_.
   This means that if the other characters kill the enemies and you
   do nothing or only inflict damage, you won't reach the next level.
   You have to win the battle using your abilities (attacking, magic,
   Limit Breaks, items, etc.), although it's okay if other characters
   damage that enemy before you kill it.

 - Finally, there is the Level 4 Limit Break.  To learn it, you must
   have learned _all_ of that character's other breaks.  Furthermore,
   you must have a special manual (you can tell what it is since it
   has the same name as the Limit Break).  If you try to use the manual
   on another character, or on a character who has yet to learn all his
   or her breaks, you'll get a message in red and white.  But when you
   have filled all the requirements, simply using the manual on the
   correct person will automatically give them their last Break (don't
   forget to set that person's level to 4 so that you can use it in
   battle :))  Here are the locations of each character's manual:

   CLOUD STRIFE
   You must earn 32,000 battle points at the Gold Saucer in _one visit_.
   You can then trade them in for the manual.

   BARETT WALLACE
   Get it from a lady wearing a hat in one of the buildings in North
   Corel after the train ride in Disc 2.

   TIFA ROCKHEART
   Go to Nivelheim and play the 'Highwind' theme twice on the piano in
   Tifa's house followed by L1+T (see section 8 for details).

   AERITH GAINSBOROUGH
   Get 1xx wins in battle (where xx are two matching digits).  Then go
   to the cave where the sleeping man is and he'll give you the Mithril.
   Head to the blacksmith's house by the Gold Saucer, give him the
   Mithril, then climb up the stairs and examine the metal lid at the
   end of the walkway.  Once you get the Highwind, doing this is a snap.
   But Aerith will have already left you by then.  So, to get her
   manual while she's still in your party in Disc 1, do the following:

   Hop on the Gold Saucer Buggy.  If you haven't gotten it yet, keep
   playing until you've finished the Gold Saucer area.  Then pilot the
   Buggy _into_ Costa Del Sol.  You'll enter the town as if you had
   walked into it.  Go to the harbor and talk to the sailor by the boat.
   Choose the top option to pay 100 gil and you can then walk along the
   dock and enter a ship, which will return to Junon Town.  Although
   there's not much new here, you will get a different reaction from
   most people because you're no longer dressed up as a guard.  Anyway,
   once you exit the city (the fastest way is to take the helicopter--
   refer to the end of section 4e for details), you'll find that you've
   brought the Buggy with you!  From here, it's a simple matter of
   heading towards the river, crossing it at the ford below the
   waterfall, then heading up to the cave where the sleeping man is.
   And after getting the Mithril, you have to go _all_ the way back to
   the Eastern Continent so you can reach the blacksmith's house.
   Well, don't say I didn't warn you!

   RED XIII
   Go to Nivelheim and unlock the safe in the right wing of Sephiroth's
   Mansion (use the code in section 8 if you don't know how).  You'll
   receive Red 13's manual from the boss when you defeat him.

   YUFFIE KISARAGI
   Return to Uutai after completing Yuffie's sub-quest.  Head to the
   pagoda and beat the five bosses within--she'll get her manual once
   Godo is defeated in battle.

   VINCENT VALENTINE
   Once you have the submarine or a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo, go to
   the waterfall in the middle of the Western Continent.  If you enter
   the waterfall from the left side with Vincent in your party, he'll
   meet a girl from his past (Rukuresshia).  You have to visit the falls
   twice, once during Disc 2 and again in Disc 3; it's during your
   second visit that you'll get his manual.  Much to my surprise, I
   tried this and it _doesn't work_!  I've heard from more than one
   source that this is the correct method, so if someone can tell me
   what I did wrong, it'd be appreciated.  All I know is that I went
   to the room under the falls in Disc 3 and there's no one there,
   even when I stuck Vincent in my party.

   CID HIGHWIND
   After you get a submarine, go underwater and search for the wrecked
   plane near the southern part of the World Map, between the Western
   and Eastern continents.  His manual is in one of the treasure chests
   inside the plane.

 - Note that Cait Sith only has two Limit Breaks; his inital one and
   one for Level 2.  You still learn it the normal way you'd learn
   the first break of a new level.  The same applies to Vincent, who
   has four Break levels but only one break per level.  All other
   characters have two breaks a level (but only one break for Level 4).

Limit Breaks become stronger and stronger as you play.  This is due in
part to your character's current level.  Limit breaks that inflict
damage become stronger depending on your Attack Power as well, even
ones like Cait's Dice attack (in which the damage amount can vary),
and Vincent's transformations (even though he doesn't use his guns).
At the very least, equipping a strong weapon will add to the basic
amount of damage a Limit Break can inflict*.

*   The only exception to this is Cait's Slot attack, when he summons
    a monster; damage is determined normally for this attack.  Remember,
    if the Break doesn't inflict damage, it isn't affected by your
    character's Attack Power.


=========================================================================
ULTIMATE WEAPONS
=========================================================================

Truly the best in offensive weaponry, the Ultimate Weapons can make
mincemeat out of even the strongest opponent (like there are any :)).

How do you know if you got an Ultimate Weapon?  Well:

 * The weapon will have eight connected Materia holders.
 * Materia attached to the weapon don't gain AP (the holders are
   black).
 * The weapon will power-up and do more damage after certain
   conditions are met.
 * The weapon (usually) has a higher Attack Power and Hit Rate than
   any other weapon.
 * The weapon's power won't decrease if you're using the Metamorphosis
   (Henka) materia.  With other weapons, Attack Power is reduced by
   about 2/3rds when using this materia against an enemy.

The sole exception to this is Aerith--her Ultimate Weapon has only
seven slots, and you _can_ earn AP for Materia equipped to them.
Also, another one of her weapons (the Umbrella), has a higher Attack
Power than her Ultimate Weapon (the Princess Guard).

Where you can find each weapon, and what you have to do to make it
power-up, is listed below:

CLOUD: ULTIMA WEAPON
Location:   Kill the Ultima Weapon (the big dragon) flying around in Disc
            2/3. It will take a few tries as he will escape from battle
            several times before finally facing you.
Condition:  The more current HP you have, the more damage this weapon
            inflicts.  (i.e. the closer your score is to the maximum
            amount, the higher the damage, regardless of defenses).


BARETT: MISSING SCORE
Location:   Look on the landing near the Sister Ray during the raid on
            Midgar City in Disc 2 (if Vincent's not in your party, he'll
            be on the landing near the chest with the Ultimate Weapon in
            it).
Condition:  Equip materia on this weapon.  The more AP a materia has,
            the higher the damage (so if you're wearing 8 mastered
            materia, Barett will do _lots_ of damage).


TIFA: PREMIUM HEART
Location:   Return to Midgar City in Disc 2 or 3 and examine the computer
            in the Wall Market.  It's in a room marked 'ITEM'.
Condition:  When Tifa performs her Limit Break, but gets a 'MISS' for
            one or more of the spinning wheels, her weapon powers-up.


AERITH: PRINCESS GUARD
Location:   You can get it in the Temple, during the talking clock mini-
            game.  This only has seven materia holders instead of eight,
            but it's still considered an Ultimate Weapon.  Since Aerith
            has no Limit Breaks that inflict damage, I wonder if this
            weapon has any effect when you use a Limit Break (see below
            for details).
Condition:  'This weapon (should) power-up when protecting an ally.'
            The English translation of this weapon's description, more
            or less.  I guess this means that this weapon is stronger
            when Aerith is healing injured companions, or that it works
            only when she's defending with a Kabau (Protect) materia?


RED 13: LIMITED MOON
Location:   Buugen Haagen will give this to Red 13 when he dies at Cosmo
            Canyon after the monster attacks Midgar City in Disc 2
            (although you can get it in Disc 3, as well).
Condition:  The more current MP you have remaining (the closer you are
            to you maximum amount of MP), the stronger this weapon is.


YUFFIE: FUGUTAITEN
Loaction:   Look in the Wrecked Plane in Disc 2 or 3.
Condition:  If an enemy's experience level is higher than Yuffie's,
            this weapon will power-up and do added damage.


CAIT SITH: MARVELOUS CHEER
Loaction:   Search the lockers on the 64th floor of the Shinra HQ during
            your raid on Midgar City during Disc 2.  You can get to the
            HQ by heading north along the underground rail passage.
Condition:  The more current MP you have remaining (the closer you are
            to you maximum amount of MP), the stronger this weapon is.


VINCENT: DEATH PENALTY
Location:   You get this when you get his limit break manual (see above).
Condition:  The more enemies that Vincent kills (as in, he finishes them
            off, at least), the stronger this weapon becomes.  This
            counts for all the enemies he's killed since he joined you,
            not the enemies he's defeated since getting this weapon
            (just like the way the computer determines damage for the
            Chocobockle Enemy Skill).


CID: VENUS GOSPEL
Location:   Talk to the old man standing outside the house that's just
            left of the rocket launch pad (the same one who gave Cloud
            a sword in Disc 1).  You can only do this after completing
            the 'Huge Materia' rocket sub-quest in Disc 2 or 3 (which
            means the rocket has been destroyed).  After talking to the
            geezer three times in a row, he'll give Cid his Ultimate
            Weapon.
Condition:  The more current MP you have remaining (the closer you are
            to you maximum amount of MP), the stronger this weapon is.

Finding these weapons can be hard or difficult; Cloud's weapon can be
easily won from the Ultima Weapon monster, but Barett's weapon won't
appear if he's not in your party, so it's easy to miss.  I myself
haven't been able to verify it, but it's been said that the power of
your character's Limit Breaks are _greatly_ increased when he/she is
wielding their 'Ultimate Weapon'.

LIMIT BREAK LIST
=========================================================================

This is a list of each character's Limit Break, it's effect, and a brief
description.  The letters and numbers mean the Break Level and which one
it is (i.e. B3/1 is Level 3, 1st Break).

============
Cloud Strife
============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1/1:           BUREIBAA                     <Braver>  (Braver)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud dashes forward and performs a diving slash against one opponent.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1/2:               KYOUGIRI       <Evil Omen Slash>  (Cross Slash)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud's three slashes create a symbol over his enemy.  When it fades
away, that enemy is hit once.  It also has a chance of paralyzing the
hit foe.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/1:               HAKOUGEKI               <Breaking Clear Attack>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud sends a wave of green energy at the targeted foe.  When it hits,
smaller waves shoot outward to hit each remaining foe, although the
damage is less than the first, big wave.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/2:     KURAIMUHAZAADO                   <Crime Hazard>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a light at the tip of his sword, Cloud throws a funnel of rising
air that sucks in all opponents for an instant kill attack. Those that
survive are dropped to the ground for further physical damage.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B4/1:         CHOKYUUBUSHINHAZAN
                                  <Super Ultimate War God Champion Slash>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A column of wind surrounds Cloud and his sword lights up.  He then
attacks all enemies for a total of 15 hits, finishing with a diving sword
slash.  The sword strikes cause physical damage, while the last strike
hits all foes.


==============
Barett Wallace
==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1/2:     MAINDOBUREIKU                      <Mind Break>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar in appearance to the Heavy Shot, Barett launches a ball of azure
energy at one opponent.  While it inflicts no damage, it completely
drains that enemy of MP.

B2/1:       GURENEEDOBOMU                    <Grenade Bomb>

fire that damages all opponents.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/2:       HANMAABUROU                       <Hammer Blow>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barett dashes forward and punches one enemy as purple waves emanate from
his arm.  If it misses, this attack causes no damage, but if it hits,
the enemy is instantly killed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B3/1:     SATORAITOBIIMU                 <Satellite Beam>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barett locks on to his enemies and calls down beams of blue light to
fry the opposition.  This attack hits for special damage.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ammunition at all opponents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steam erupts from Barett's weapon as he leaps into the air and fires an
earth-scorching beam of yellow light at all his enemies.  This attack
hits ten times in all for special damage.


===============
Tifa Rockheart*
===============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1/1:         SHOUDARASSHU         <Palm of Hand Strike Rush>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A quick combination of punches.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1/2:         SAMAASORUTO                        <Somersault>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A somersault kick.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/1:             SUIMENSHOKARI              <Water Surface Kick>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A sweep kick that hits for water damage.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/2:       METEODORAIVU                      <Meteo Drive>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A back-slam.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B3/1:     DORUFINBUROU                     <Dolphin Blow>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rising uppercut accompanied by a geyser of water with a dolphin riding
on top of it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B3/2:     METEOSUTORAIKU                   <Meteo Strike>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tifa grabs her opponent, jumps in the air, and body-slams them as a
huge explosion appears.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B4/1:     FAINARUHEVUN                     <Final Heaven>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tifa strikes her enemy with a huge, exploding attack.


*  Tifa's Limit Break works like this; the more Limit Breaks she learns,
   the more slots appear in the slot machine that picks the skill she
   uses (the abilities listed above).  When she gains a new Break, she
   is able to use a new attack.  She can learn up to 10 slots total.
   When picking a slot, there are three outcomes: HIT, which makes Tifa
   perform one of the above attacks, YEAH!, which works like HIT but
   increases the damage inflicted, and MISS, which makes Tifa do nothing.
   Tifa will then proceed to perform all the moves you end up with in
   a row.  She will randomly switch to a new enemy (or stay with the one
   she's attacking) for each new move.

   For some reason, Tifa never goes any farther than the Dolphin Blow
   when I use this Break, even if I get 7 'Yeah!' scores (since some
   of the slots have nothing on them but 'Miss'.  Someone want to tell
   me why I can't get all the hits?


===================
Aerith Gainsborough

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aerith waves her staff, causing blue lightning to hit herself and her
allies, followed by yellow, circular lights.  This will instantly max
out the other characters' Limit gauges.

B2/1:             BATSUSANGAISEI   <Extract Mountain Cover World>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The screen turns red and Yuffie hits all enemies with her weapon 10
times for physical damage.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B3/1:             GAISHUUICHISHOKU   <Armored Sleeves' One Touch>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yuffie creates a blue light beneath all her opponents.  A column of blue
light bursts upward, hitting every one for special dmaage.

Cait Sith
=========

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cait's stuffed moogle throws several dice to the ground.  The score that
is rolled determines how much damage the targeted enemy will receive.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B2/1:             SUROTTO                                  <Slot>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A slot machine appears.  Depending on what you pick, a different result
will occur:

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - <Name of summoned monster>                                      3 bars
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cait Sith randomly calls upon a summoned monster.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six toy soldiers appear and fire at all enemies for special damage.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   A moogle (from the 'Summon Chocobo & Moguri' spell) appears and does
   a dance that completely restores each members' HP and MP.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   A cat-girl appears and all allies have a 100% hit rate (no chance of
   missing) for the rest of the battle.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -                    GATTAI  <Combine>                     3 moogles
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cait's allies disappear and his moogle grows twice as large, gaining
   9999 HP and 999 MP.  In this form, he can do anything but use Limit
   Breaks, and his attacks cause more damage.  When the battle is over,
   everyone's current HP and MP drop to 1/3rd their former amount.  He
   can't use this ability if there are less than 3 allies.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -            AARUOOBA  <All Over>                    3 faces
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   against any enemy.

 -            JOKAADESU  <Death Joker>        face, face, bar
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   All allies are instantly killed.  There's no way to avoid this, even
   with the help of accessories like the Safety Bit or an Enemy Skill
   such as Death Force.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -            TOIBOKKUSU  <Toy Box>     any other combination
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   A random object is dropped on one enemy, inflicting physical damage.
   It can be a Hell House, Debu Chocobo, Magic Hammer, icicles, a
   boulder, or a Cometeo-like meteor attack.  Just like when you attack
   normally, it's possible to hit for extra damage (like making a
   critical hit attack).


==================

NOTES
- Words in CAPS are the translated name.
- Words in (  ) are the English name (from the FF7 demo disk).
- Words in <  > are the guessed English name.
- 'x' means that I don't know the character and couldn't
  translate it.
- 'Physical' is damage caused by your weapon which you can lessen using
  Barrier.  'Elemental' is element damage (fire, ice, lightning, etc.)
  that you can lessen using accessories and to which some enemies are
  immune.  'Special' damage is from an attack that can't be defended
  against/avoided by any means short of invincibility.
- Yes, I used the GameShark to see Young Cloud and Sephiroth's Breaks.

________________________________________________________  ABOUT THIS LIST

 - Note that the romaji was not translated directly.  In some cases,
   the actual kanji-to-romaji spellings are different from what I
   interpreted them as; I assume that both are correct.  Below are
   the direct spellings as opposed to the spellings in the above
   list:

   Reiki    = Burizado, Burizara, Burizaga
   Daichi   = Kueiku, Kueira, Kueiga
   Doku     = Baio, Baiora, Baioga
   Juuryoku = Gurabide, Gurabira, Gurabiga
   Kaifuku  = Kearu, Kearura, Kearuga
   Fulkea   = Furukea
   Altema   = Arutema

 - Pretty much all of the kanji used in the spellings of the Limit Breaks
   were translated kanji by kanji (I'm horrible at pairing them).  I know
   the names sound funky and make no sense, but I'm at a loss unless
   someone provides me with the actual translations.

 - Characters I weren't able to translate are replaced with an 'x'.
   Kanji that I couldn't display are replaced with an 'X'.

 - If an object's name is untranslated (such as 'xx no x'), then the
   effect (for items and accessories) or statistics (for weapons and
   bracelets) of that object will be given in parenthesis instead, so
   you can tell what the object is by what it does/how if affects you.
   The statistics are listed in this order:

   WEAPONS:
   (Attack Power/Hit Rate/Single Materia Holders/Connected Materia
   Holders/Gained AP Bonus)

   BRACELETS:
   (Defense Power/Evade Rate/Magic Defense Power/Magic Evade Rate/Single
   Materia Holders/Connected Materia Holders/Gained AP Bonus)

 - Words enclosed in [ ] take up two lines due to their size.

 - Finally, anything enclosed in < > is accessible/usable only with a
   Game Shark code.

______________________________________________________  TRANSLATION NOTES
Tensei no Honoo / Flame of Reincarnation
This is the literal translation.  If your dead allies were revived as
frogs, it might make sense :)  But in this case, I think 'tensei' is
supposed to mean 'ressurection' instead of 'reincarnation'.

Shurudan / Hand Pomegranate Bullet
Well, this is that actual kanji-by-kanji translation...  If you look at
the individual translations, you may think of a grenade.  In Japanese,
grenade is 'tekidan', which would fit the first and last kanji ('shu'
and 'ru', since shu can also be 'te'), but not the middle one.

Bomu no Migiude / Right Arm Bomb
Okay, believe it or not, this item has appeared in other FF games with
the exact same name.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe this
item is the right arm of the enemy you get it from (the little floating,
self-destructing creatures that are also in other FF games).

Wakiwashisou / Delusion Washi Weed
If you spell 'washi' using kanji, it means a type of thin rice paper.
I don't know what 'washi' is supposed to mean in this case, but think
about it...a weed wrapped in paper that causes delusions?  And 'sou'
can also be translated as 'herb'.  In other words, this is a joint!

Nankyoku no Kaze / Antarctic Wind
'Nankyoku' literally means 'north pole', but this item has been
translated as 'Antarctic' in previous FF games, so that's the word
I used.

Reiki no Ketsushou / Cold Binding Crystal
This is my best guess for the translation.  I'm sure that 'ketsushou'
spelled differently is a real word, but I don't know the correct way
to spell it in English.

Dengekitori no Tsuno / Electric Shock Bird Horn
You can win this item from the birds that cast thunder spells in the
Uutai area, so 'dengeki' (electrick shock) and 'tori' (bird) seem to
be correct.  I think 'tsuno' implies the type of horn you use to make
a sound (and summon others), not the horn of an animal.

Yuugaibutsushitsu / Harmfulness Material
As it is, the name basically means that this object has a harmful
quality (it poisons enemies).  As strange as this sounds, this is
the actual implication of the kanji.

Jikuudan / Space-Time Bullet
'Jikuu' is time and space, and 'dan' is bullet.  What this has to do
with casting a gravity-related spell is beyond me.  I recall there
being a magic series in FF5j called 'Jikuumahou' (Time-Space Magic)
that a class of magic users could learn, and I think the gravity spells
(Juuryoku) were part of that magic set.  However, I haven't played FF5j
in at least a year, so I'm not too sure.

Souryuu no Kiba / Fang of Dragon Pair
The literal translation of the kanji is 'Pair Dragon of Fang'.  Usually,
anything with 'no' in it is supposed to be rearranged, but even then,
the name of this item doesn't make much sense.  Of course, you do win
it from Twin Head (a two-headed boss monster), so 'Dragon Pair' isn't
_that_ far off from 'twin', I guess.

Misuriru Seibaa / Mithril Saber
'Mithril' is not a real substance, but it's used in video games a lot.
It was made up by a novelist named J. R. R. Tolkien, who published a
series of fantasy books some time ago.  'Misuriru' is simply the romaji
version of this word.

Riku x syukichikou / ?
With all but one kanji translated, you think I could figure this one
out.  As it is, none of the kanji go together, making the translation
'Land x Protect Good Luck Journey'.  I have my guesses as to what this
means, but until I can get the second kanji, I'm not going to hazard
a translation.

Daianakkuru / Daia Knuckle
It would make sense if 'daia' were short for 'diamond', but I recall
hearing somewhere that 'daia' is supposed to be an incredibly hard
substance found in the Final Fantasy universe.

Purachina Fist / Platinum Fist
Like 'Chitanbanguru' (see below), 'purachina' is a real word that
means 'platinum'.  Since most people aren't familiar with it, I
simply made a double translation and wrote it as 'platinum'.

Pairubankaa / Pile Banker
This weapon looks like a harpoon or grappling hook, yet it is not a
projectile weapon.  The translation 'Pile Banker' has no meaning, but
then what could the name of this weapon be?

Supurigankurippu / Spriggan Clip
Does anyone know if 'spriggan' is a real word?  That's what I translated
'supurigan' as, since I couldn't make it into any recognizable word.

Waizaaroddo / Wizier/Confusion Rod
I assume that 'waizaa' is translated as 'wizier' (also spelled with a
'v').  According to the online dictionary I use, it means 'confusion'.
Since this weapon doesn't confuse enemies in battle, I chose to list
both meanings until I can discover which one is appropriate.

Fiariiteiru / Fairy Tail
A play on words.  What's given above is the exact translation, but
'tale' is pronounced the same way in English (as in 'fairy tale').
Get it?  Ha, ha...ahem.

Ronginusu / Long Noose
My translation of this 'long noose' is probably wrong, but I can't think
of any other translation that fits.  Any ideas?

Biiansugosuperu / Venus Gospel
Yes, 'Venus Gospel' is the correct translation of this weapon's name.  As
is usual in Japanese games, two words having to deal with two distinctly
different things (the worship of Greek gods and Christianity) have been
put together to produce a nonsensical name.

Juuji Shuriken / Cross Throwing Star
This translation seems like it makes sense, but the individual kanji mean
something like 'ten characters'.  Anyone know more about this?   Of
interest only to me is the fact that the kanji for 'shuriken' translate
individually as something like 'hand inside blade'.

Manji Shuriken / Manji Throwing Star
Unlike 'Cross Throwing Star', the manji symbol has no real meaning (at
least not in present day terms).  But before you get worked up, keep in
mind that the first symbol is not a swastika.  While they look similar,
the manji is turned counter-clockwise, and was given it's name by
Japanese Buddhists, who have used the symbol for centuries to mean good
fortune and prosperity.

Fuuma Shuriken / Wind Demon Throwing Star
This translation would work, but a lot of people are familiar with
Japanese words like 'shuriken', or the names of swords 'Masamune',
'Murasame', 'Muramasa', so this weapon and the other two may simply
be more recognizable as 'Juuji/Manji/Fuuma Shuriken'.

Fugutaiten / Irreconcilable
The translation given is the direct one, but a more loose translation
would be something like 'I'll never agree' or 'ever-clashing enemies'.

Randaru, Raiatto, Bantorain
I'm assuming that these names (given in romaji) have English equivalents
(i.e. they're real guns).  Anyone know which ones?  Also, can anyone
figure out what the CR in 'Sniper CR' and the ST in 'Highbrow ST' stand
for?

Gin Tama Teppou / Silver Jewel Gun
The kanji for 'tama' means jewel or orb, but there's another kanji for
'tama' that means bullet.  I think the latter one would have made more
sense (as in Silver Bullet Gun), but I'm just translating what's there,
so....

Masamune / Quick Blood Rain
I heard this translation from someone else (can't remember who, but you
get credit, of course).  However, the translations of the two individual
kanji end up meaning something like 'point of justice' as in, the sword-
point of justice (see what I mean?  This translation is sort of like
gunslingers in the old West who made their own 'justice' by killing
others.  Doesn't make too much sense unless you know about these things).
I don't know which one is correct, though.

Chitanbanguru / Titanium Bangle
This is something of a modified translation, since 'chitan' is a word
in it's own right (it's Japanese for titanium).  This kind of pairing
('real' Japanese words with romaji) is common in Japanese words and is
a nightmare to translate if you don't realize that one word is in fact
a 'genuine' word.

Eijisu no Udewa / Aegis Bracelet
I have no idea if 'eijisu' is the romaji version of 'aegis' or not, but
it seems to fit.  The word 'aegis' comes from Latin, and was a shield
carried by the gods in Greek mythology.

Shinrayasushikibougu / Shin-Ra Relaxed Form Defense Tool
I couldn't make this into anything, so it's listed here translated
kanji by kanji.  Yes, the first two characters stand for 'Shin-Ra'
as in the group that you're fighting against.  I would assume that
'Relaxed Form' means that this bracelet is weaker than the other
bracelet below?

Shinrakoukeibougukai / Shin-Ra Armor Type Defend Tool Reform
This item has pretty much the same story as the first one.  From
the meanings of the kanji, it seems as if this bracelet is a
remade, stronger version of the 'shinrayasushikibougu'?

Retsuka no Udewa / Ardent Flame Bracelet
Literally, 'violent flame' bracelet.  No matter how you translate it,
I think retsuka is supposed to mean 'great fire' as in a bonfire or
large blaze, but 'ardent flame' seemed to be the closest I could get
without changing the meaning of the word.

Kyokukou no Udewa / Aurora Bracelet
Literally, 'pole light', or the Aurora Borealis (sp)?  Together,
the kanji for 'kyokukou' mean 'aurora'.

Tenrai no Udewa / Thunder Bracelet
Literally, 'heavenly/divine thunder', perhaps referring to the wrath
or might of the gods.  Together, the kanji for 'tenrai' mean 'thunder'.

Misutiiru / Myth Tear
I know this sounds wrong, but what else could you translate it as?

Boudan Chokki / ?
Well, the kanji for 'Boudan' translate loosely as 'bulletproof'
(literally, 'protect bullet'), but I can't figure out what 'chokki'
(in romaji) is supposed to mean.  I assume it's an article of clothing
or a piece of jewelry, but can't make any definite translations.

Eremesu no Kutsu / Hermes' Shoes
I thought this seemed correct, and it would fit according to the purpose
of the item (it makes your Time Bar go faster, and Hermes was a Greek
god said to be incredibly fast), but it doesn't sound exactly right.

Tetoraerementaru / Tetra-Element
For those of you who don't know, 'tetra-' is a prefix that means 'four',
which is the reason why this accessory protects you from the four basic
elements (fire, earth, etc.)

Nusuzoku no Shoute / Thief's Vulgar Little Hand
I doubt this is the correct translation, but the kanji used for this
item all have meanings that sound right.  Anyone care to translate this
for me?

Hyupunokuraun / Hypno-Crown
'Hypno' is short for 'hypnotic', which is obvious if you consider the
effect of this item (you have a higher success rate when using the
Control/Manipulate materia).

Kyougiri / Evil Omen Slash
This could also be 'Evil Behead', 'Bad Luck Murder' or 'Villan Kill',
depending on how you translate the kanji 'kyou' and 'zan (ki)'.  In the
FF7 demo disc, this was translated as 'Cross Slash'--which is completely
wrong.  During the Break, Cloud actually slashes out the kanji for
'kyou' with his sword (Evil Omen).

Hakougeki / Breaking Clear Attack
I'm not sure if 'clear' is supposed to mean that there's nothing around,
or that something can be seen clearly, but it makes sense when written
along with the other words.

Garyuutensei / Picture Dragon Finishing Touch
There's a old story in which a boy gets a magical paintbrush that will
make whatever he paints come to life.  The boy becomes a successful
artist by painting very lifelike pictures, which he always leaves
incomplete so the drawing doesn't spring to life and leave the paper.
To make a long story short, he finishes drawing a picture of a dragon
but a drop of ink from his brush lands on the paper; right where the
dragon' eye would be, completing the picture and revealing his secret
to everyone else when the dragon flies away.

...What this has to do with Cloud's Limit Break is beyond me, but
that's what the above kanji imply, so there you have it.  Edmond Chiu
suggests that Cloud is 'drawing' a picture with his sword, and the
enemies act like the 'eyes' of the picture.

Chokyuubushinhazan / Super Ultimate War God Champion Slash
Sounds strange, doesn't it?  All the kanji used to make up this word
are seperate, although you can pair 'bu' and 'shin' together.  My
take on this is a little incomplete, but here's some of the possible
meanings:

Kanji Breakdown of Cloud's Level 4 Limit Break

       Chou      Kyuu   Bu    Shin          Ha               Zan
Transcend/Hyper  Study  War   God/   Champion/Supreme  Behead/Kill
Super/Ultra                  Master                    Murder/Slash

Together, 'Bushin' means 'Army God'.  There is also a god of war called
Ashura.  If 'ha' were to mean 'champion', another implied meaning could
be 'the War God's Champion', as in, this person (the champion) is the one
who is attacking.

I'm not sure about 'study'.  Maybe it implies mastery through studying
the art of fighting/war?  Assuming the first kanji was 'transcend', it
could mean 'Transcending Knowledge' as in beyond understanding/more
important than the sum of all knowledge.

However, Edmond Chiu (who knows a lot more about kanji than I do),
suggests that the translation is "something like 'Super Ultimate War
God Champion Slash.'"  Sounds good to me.

Shoudarassyu / Palm of Hand Strike Rush
Well, rassyu (in romaji) translates as 'rush'.  But the two kanji that
make up 'shouda' have more than one meaning--I got 'palm of hand' from
'shou' and doubt if that's the correct translation (although it sounds
good in English :).

Hoshi no Shugo / Guardian Star
'Shugo' actually translates as 'protect' or 'safeguard', but it seemed
to me that 'guardian' would make more sense when written with 'star'.
I generally try to avoid putting my own spin on translations, so if you
don't like what I've written, use one of the other examples.

Seimei no Kodou / Life Beat
Obviously, what this is supposed to mean is 'heart beat', but then
again, 'life' and 'heart beat' are connected, so this isn't as strange
as it looks.

Ooinarufukuin / Great Word of God
Another translation would be 'Great Gospel'.  I wonder if this will be
translated exactly when the English version of FF7 is released? :)

Mekoushisui      / Clear Mirror, Still Water
Gaishuuichishoku / Armored Sleeves' One Touch
Seishahitsumetsu / All Living Human Must Perish
All these translations are according to Edmond Chiu, who explains that
Square used the kanji for both literal and meaningful purposes.  The
literal translations are: Bright Mirror Stop Water, Armed Shoulder One
Hit, and Life Person Inevitable Destroy.  Anyone know what 'Extract
Mountain Cover World' (Batsusangaisei) is supposed to mean?

Dairantou / Big Fray
Together 'ran' and tou' mean 'fray'.  I prefer their seperate
translations, which would make this word 'Big Riot War'.  Sounds
better, doesn't it?

 - The materia description acts as if this item has no holders.  You can
   only get this weapon by using the Item Select GS code (look elsewhere
   in the FAQ for details).  It appears with a handgun icon, as if it
   were a weapon for Vincent, but he cannot equip it.  Equipping it on
   Sephiroth is kinda useless since he already has one.

=========================================================================
SHOPPING LIST
=========================================================================

This section is a list of each shop in the game and what you can purchase
there.  Please keep the following notation in mind:

Bracelet    - a bracelet anyone can wear.  'd' means 'Defense Power'
              and the number afterwards shows what your defense power
              will be changed to if this bracelet is equipped.  Next
              to that is a number and a letter; this indicates the
              number of Materia holders and whether they are single
              (s), or combined (c).
Weapon      - a weapon.  The name next to it indicates who can wield
              it.  'a' means 'Attack Power' and the number afterwards
              shows what your attack power will be changed to if this
              weapon is carried.  Next to that is a number and a
              letter; this indicates the number of Materia holders and
              whether they are single (s), or combined (c).  'None'
              means that that weapon has no Materia holders.

All the statistics below apply to all three discs.  If the goods for
sale or prices change from one disc to the next, then it will say
'(location) - DISC #' afterwards, which is why a location may be listed
more than once.

MONSTER LIST
=========================================================================

This section lists each monster in the game and gives it's statistics,
what you can win from it, where it's found at, and other information,
all shown below:

Name in Kanji/Kana  NAME IN ROMAJI  <translated name>
  Exp. Level       Amount of EXP won  Can you steal from it?
  Maximum HP       Amount of AP won   Can you win something from it?
  Maximum MP       Amount of Gil won  Can you morph it into something?
  Can you control it?
  Attacks it uses in battle:
  Notes: (weaknesses, where it can be found, etc.)

I'd also like to say right now that this section was NOT written by
me.  What I did is take the original document and simply translate
it from Japanese to English, as well as re-format it.  _All_ I did
was translate it, the document was _originally_ written by someone
else.  Because of this, I haven't verified much of this document, so
don't ask me questions about this section because I won't be able to
answer them.  (I know I sound like a jerk, but I can see it coming).

Which brings me to another problem.  I can't view Japanese characters
on my web browser--I'm pretty sure I found this document at a place
called the 'Final Fantasy VII Database', or something close to that,
but when I went back to what I thought was the correct site, there
was no FF7 section.  Also, since I can't see Japanese characters, I
have no idea who I should be giving credit to (since someone else wrote
this section, remember?)  If anyone knows the URL of the site I'm
talking about, or knows who wrote this monster list, please tell me
so I can give proper credit.

Remember, my Japanese is limited at best, so I'm sure there's a lot
of mistakes in here (the 'Water Ghost Connect Shift System Ether' or
whatever else I mangled during translations :)) This list has been
alphabetized going by the romaji translations; it was originally
alphabetized according to the Japanese alphabet.  Because kanji have
more than one spelling, and because it's easy to confuse the kana,
the English alphabetization may not quite match the EUC-encoded kana
and kanji for each monster.  I highly suggest you find a table or
chart of both kanas so that you can look up the name of the monster
you're fighting.  Kanji is another story--you'll have to rough it
unless you have a friend who can read kanji or the like.  However,
there's not many kanji names in here, so it shouldn't be a problem.
Most of the enemies with kanji in their names are either Shin-Ra
soldiers or enemies in the Sunken Plane.

Finally, I know that some of the Japanese in here was not translated,
and that there is a lot of garbled English with no Japanese equivalent.
This list is _long_, and checking every inch of it for descrepancies
would be time-consuming, to say the least.

=========================================================================
RUMORS AND SPECULATION
=========================================================================

This section contains a list of the most popular rumors in Final
Fantasy 7.  I've attempted to answer them using my own knowledge as well
as information that others have shared with me.  After listing the
rumor (as a question), I offer reasons (not evidence, mind you) why the
rumor may or may not be true--but I'm not saying that my arguments are
sound.  Finally, there's my own opinion on the rumor.  Remember, it is
YOU, the reader, who must decide what's true and what's not--don't blame
me for voicing my opinion since I'm not saying that I am correct.  I'm
only presenting my belief concerning each rumor.

Also, I'm not trying to say that any of the FAQs contributors are liars
or that they're just making stuff up--several people have told me their
opinions/knowledge about the rumors and I have no intention of making
them into scapegoats.  What they say is perfectly valid: as NONE of
these rumors have been PROVEN to be true or false, these people are just
as right or as wrong as the rest of us.  There is _no_ hard evidence in
the game concerning these rumors--even the 'Suichuu Kokyuu' materia
only _suggests_ that the Aerith rumor could be true as it has no effect
in the game as far as anyone knows.  And it IS perfectly possible that
Square had planned alternate endings but never put them on any of the
discs once they decided to can other parts of the game.

In an interview with the lead members of Square, it was stated that
the Aerith rumor is just that, a rumor.  It was also said that no other
endings were made because they (the Square programmers) would have to
create entirely new endings depending on whether or not Yuffie or
Vincent had joined your party.  Just so you know.

The section following this one contains all the documents that I used in
presenting, proving, and disproving these rumors; as you'll see should
you read it, there are many reasons why a rumor could be true or false.
All I'm trying to say is that we're all entitled to our own opinions,
and my opinions shouldn't be taken as the truth or be used as a reason
to put down others just because they have good reason to believe that a
rumor is true or false.  And if you haven't even played FF7, you're not
even in a position to judge anybody anyway, are you?

With that little reminder out of the way, on with the rumors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you revive Aerith after her death in Disc One?  I heard that Square
had planned to let you resurrect her, but then decided against it.  Why?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SUPPORTS THIS RUMOR:
Originally there was a rumor spread by a certain individual named Ben
Lansing who claimed that Square had originally been working on a
scenario which, if completed, would allow you to bring Aerith back to
life using a special materia.  The reason why people thought he had
so much crediblity is because he said he was a former temporary worker
for Square USA, and the information he presented to the 'outside world'
seemed impossible for someone to know unless they had been affiliated
with Square.

In the game itself, there is an Independent Materia called 'Suichuu
Kokyuu' which means 'Underwater Breath/Respiration'.  You can only
get it using a Game Shark code.  According to Mr. Lansing's story, you
needed a materia that would let you go underwater in order to revive
Aerith, so this could be that materia that he was referring to, since
there are no other materia in the game with that name or power.  Also,
if you return to Midgar City in Disc 2 or 3, you will see a flickering
image of Aerith in the church that Mr. Lansing claimed was left in by
mistake--it was supposed to be followed by a sequence with Cloud
talking to Aerith's ghost.  Lansing also gave several reasons for
Square removing the revival process, including the fact that Square was
pressed for time.  This is true--Square had already delayed the game
once and finished it shortly before it was shipped, and the obvious
incompleteness of the ending adds even more credence to his story.

Also, before the final battle, there is an extra ledge that no one is
standing on.  And if you are able to make three groups, one group will
only have two members.  Some people say that that proves that there
should have been an extra member in your party, who would be Aerith.

WHAT CONTRADICTS THIS RUMOR:
Mr. Lansing claimed that the materia that would let you go underwater
was a yellow (Command) materia.  The 'Suichuu Kokyuu' materia is
purple (Independant) instead.  Also, it has no known effect in the
game, even if one has follows the instructions concerning the Materia
that Lansing explained in his message.  Furthermore, he claimed that
there were two alternate endings you could see if Aerith was revived,
but it has been proven that there are no extra FMV ending files on
any of the discs, and even if the ending wasn't an FMV sequence, no
one has yet discovered any of quotes or graphics that might have been
used in either of the 'alternate' endings.  Most people also overlook
the fact that, although it's difficult, you CAN get her 4th level
Limit Break before her death near the end of Disc One--it was
originally thought that if you couldn't get it normally, why would
it be in the game unless Aerith could get it after her revival?  Now,
of course, that has been proven to be false.

One part of Lansing's story is rather interesting since it has yet to
be fully proven or disproven.  To get the underwater breathing materia,
according to him, you had to get the Area 5 Key during the first disc,
take Aerith to meet the General, then go into Midgar City and meet the
General's sick friend.  Aerith would care for him, but he would still
die.  Because Aerith tried to help, the General would remember her and
give Cloud the Suichuu Kokyuu materia in Disc 2.  According to Lansing,
the one thing that prevents you from doing this little side-quest is
the Area 5 Key, which was removed in the first disc only.  He insists
that the quest could be partially completed with a Game Shark.

Now, you get the Area 5 Key by digging at the Excavator's Site.  But
you can't even dig at the site until after Aerith's left for the
Ancient City.  So you'd need two codes, one to be able to dig up the
Key, and another one to stick Aerith back in your party (that last
part is easy enough to do :))  Even assuming you had a GS code to
simply put the Area 5 Key in your inventory, you'd run into another
problem almost immediately: while you do see the General leaving the
town after rescuing Aerith from the church in Midgar, he doesn't
appear outside of the city until the second disc, which means that
Lansing wasn't exactly right; _two_ things were removed from the game,
if his story is true.  And the General is a key part of this so-called
sub-quest.  That would seem to prove his story false right there, but
the General didn't give the materia until after you had cared for his
sick friend (the guy living in the tube near Aerith's house).  If you
were able to get back into Midgar with Aerith, and _anything_ happened
when you met the sick man, that alone would be very important;
according to Lansing, the whole point of this quest is to be able to
revive Aerith later, so if it's in there, it may be for the reason he
stated.  And if the General appeared when you left and gave you the
Underwater Breath materia or gave it to Cloud in Disc 2, as Lansing
states, then that would be the first piece of hard evidence to come
forward concerning the rumor.

The game's plot is also a large obstacle in the way of this rumor.  While
it seems that Square could have changed the plot in order to 'cover up'
the removed revival process, that would be a lot of dialogue to change.
Even the bit with Aerith in the church after her death is explained in
the game.  The biggest contradiction is that Aerith has NO lines of her
own in any of the other discs, even if a Game Shark code is used to
access her in later discs.  Also, the game freezes if she enters any
conversation/event in the later discs, further discrediting the rumor.
The only times she speaks is when she's saying a quote that any character
in your party would say at the time (such as just after crashing during
the snowboard event).  She also has no extra weapons available to her in
later discs, unlike any other character.

MY OPINION:
No, you cannot revive Aerith.  If you really have to play with her,
just use my Game Shark code, okay? :)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
What about extra characters?  Aside from Vincent and Yuffie, isn't it
true that you can have Sephiroth or 'Young Cloud' join your party?
And what about the character called 'Baakusa'?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SUPPORTS THIS RUMOR:
The fact that Sephiroth does join your party, at least for a time.
Like any playable character, he can fight, cast magic, and even use
magic outside of battle.  Plus, you can move him around and check
his stats.  If you use a Game Shark code, you can dequip and equip
him with materia and other equipment.  As for Baakusa, he is
supposed to be an imp (better known as a kappa to Japanese gamers)
that was removed from the game due to time contraints, as the rumor
goes.  Using the same code that enables Sephiroth to join your party
at any time, you can also see two extra character portraits, made up
of red hiragana (characters used in the Japanese alphabet).  One of
those could belong to Baakusa.  And Young Cloud has his own portrait,
his own stats, and can use materia.  He can equip things, raise
levels, and be controlled in battle just like a normal ally.
Throughout the game, Cloud battles his 'self'--that second self could
be the younger part of him, or Young Cloud.

WHAT CONTRADICTS THIS RUMOR:
Even with Sephiroth in your party, he is still controlled by the
computer.  And like with the GS code that lets you use Aerith,
Sephiroth cannot have a conversation or appear on the screen without
the game hanging, indicating that he has no lines in the game, not
even 'general quotes' that any ally might say.  Furthermore, he has
no weapons available to him aside from the Masamune (which doesn't
even have it's own icon; see below), and his portrait cannot appear
on the PHS screen.  To add to that, Sephiroth does not have any
Limit Breaks; if you use the GS code, it says that he has Vincent's,
which is impossible*.

While one of the two portraits could conceivably be for Baakusa, the
translations of the characters spell out 'Now Printing'.  A likely
conclusion for this would be that this was used while the portraits
were still being drawn/decided upon, a theory that is further backed
up by the fact that in the FF7 demo disc, none of the characters have
the same portraits used in the finished version (in fact, Cloud has
Young Cloud's portrait!)  If you load up either of the 'Now Printing'
portraits using a Game Shark code, you'll see that they don't have
their own stats/limit break/etc.  Also, each character in FF7 uses his
own type of weapon, but Baakusa has none, while even Sephiroth had a
weapon (although the icon with it was Vincent's gun, indicating that
perhaps you would never be able to buy/receive new weapons for Seph,
which further discredits that rumor).  The 'Now Printing' portrait
won't fit in the PHS screen, either.

How could Young Cloud join your party--through a time warp?  Remember,
Cloud's flashback takes place several years ago.  Even if you could
get Young Cloud, what would the point be?  Young Cloud doesn't have a
Limit Break; use a code and it says you have Cait Sith's (which is a
bug since Young Cloud, like Sephiroth, can't use it, even if you
activate a Game Shark code to have an fully-filled Limit Meter).  And
the Cloud in your party can do everything Young Cloud could do, too.
He also starts at a higher level.  Like the other 'hidden' characters,
Young Cloud's portrait is messed up if you try to stick him in the PHS
screen.  So even if you could get Young Cloud, why would you want him?

*  Vincent is NOT Sephiroth, despite what some people say.  The only
   reason why Vincent and Seph seem to have some similar abilities in
   terms of 'glitch' weapons and 'glitch' Limit Breaks is because
   Vincent is considered by the game to be the last normal character
   in the game before Sephiroth.  Although he comes before Cid in the
   'Character Select' code, that's because the nine playable characters
   appear in the earliest order that you could receive them.  In terms
   of Limit Breaks and weapons, Vincent always appears before Sephiroth,
   and the only reason why the handgun icon is used for Sephiroth's
   Masamune is because you're not able to equip Sephiroth with other
   weapons--the designers of the game had no need to make an icon
   because no one could ever see it normally, so they just used
   Vincent's.  Even if you don't believe this, Vincent's past (he was
   a former Turk) goes against the plot--and Sephiroth was already
   alive at the time (in his human form...I'm not talking about the
   'copy' Sephiroths that you see throughout the game.  Sephiroth
   protects his body by placing it in the Crater, but before he learned
   that he was inhuman, he only used his real body).  And no, I don't
   believe the theory that Seph could have controlled his alternate
   form of 'Vincent' by mind control, the same way that Reeve controls
   Cait Sith.  If I got the plot confused--well, hey, I can't read any
   of it, so don't blame me.

MY OPINION:
Vincent and Yuffie are the only 'hidden' characters in the game--the
only time when Sephiroth is in your party is during Cloud's flashback
at Kalm Town in Disc 1 (when Cloud is replaced by Young Cloud), and
there is no character named 'Baakusa'.  Once again, if you just have
to have either Seph or Young Cloud in your party, try a GS code.


------------------------------------------------------------------
Well then, what about the 'Chocobo Control' materia?  You can have
a Chocobo join your party if you use the materia, can't you?
------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SUPPORTS THIS RUMOR:
There is a chocobo 'portrait' in the game, just like the one that your
allies have.  Also, the chocobo isn't a true enemy in the game, he/she
will only atack if you hit it first.  Plus, you can ride around on them
and breed them, so perhaps they're friendly enough to want to fight
alongside your allies.

WHAT CONTRADICTS THIS RUMOR:
The portrait is used simply for the purpose of naming a Chocobo during
the breeding scenario in Disc 2 onwards.  Should you use a Game Shark
code to add the portrait to your party, you'll see that it doesn't have
it's own stats/limit breaks/etc, and the portrait glitches in the PHS
menu.  And, there are no weapons in the game made for a Chocobo to use.
Most importantly, there isn't even a 'Chocobo Control' materia in the
game, and you can't control Chocobos using 'Ayatsuru', either.  Even if
you could, you could probably only make them attack someone, not join
your party.  If they did have such a command, it would be the sole
exception out of every other controlled monster's commands in the entire
game.

MY OPINION:
There is no way to have a Chocobo join your party at any time during
the game.

If you think about it, all these rumors contradict each other.  There
are nine spaces in the PHS screen, and supposing you could revive
Aerith, they would all be filled.  But, one character is always leading
the party, so that clears up a space.  None of the hidden characters
portraits will work in the PHS screen.  However, Cloud's portrait fits
in the PHS screen, so that would leave three free spaces (your active
party).  So it must be possible, right?  Wrong.  There are four rumored
characters: Sephiroth, Young Cloud, Baakusa, and the Chocobo.  So where
would the fourth one go?  And if you say that they'd all fit if you
couldn't revive Aerith, then, okay, you may be right--but that means
that the rumor about bringing Aerith back to life is false, and if it's
true, one of the above rumors is also false.  If you say that maybe
they only join for a little while (maybe while Cloud is recuperating in
Mideel or for the period of time between Aerith's death and the first
chance you would have to supposedly 'revive' her), then that would also
be an event unlike any other event in the game.  Sephiroth is only in
your party for a little while, but remember that it's not really your
current party--it's just Young Cloud and Sephiroth during Cloud's
flashback.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
What about other endings in the game?  Let's ignore the whole Aerith
thing for a moment?  Doesn't the ending in FF7 seem a bit unfinished?
Could it be possible that there are alternate endings, just like in
Chrono Trigger?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SUPPORTS THIS RUMOR:
Frankly, most everyone agrees that the ending does seem a little
incomplete.  And Mr. Lansing said that the 'main' ending was supposed to
have scences with Vincent and Yuffie in it.  In terms of FF7's plot, the
ending seems to wrap up Cloud's history and his troubles, but you never
hear about anyone else, with the exception of Red 13 (and that's not
explained either).  Taking the Aerith rumor into consideration,
throughout the game, Cloud is in situations in which he either must pick
Aerith over Tifa or show that he is a caring guy or an uncaring guy.
But, these choices affect the game in a very minor manner--the characters
reactions change a little, and the 'date' scene in the Gold Saucer
changes depending on the choices you made, but after Disc 1, the whole
thing is dropped.  According to information concerning the other endings,
Aerith lives happily with Cloud or commits suicide (read the Documents
section below) because of Cloud's actions.  Considering the number of
times when Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith get involved in a situation like the
ones I mentioned, it seems very likely that there could be other
endings.

WHAT CONTRADICTS THIS RUMOR:
People have searched the third disc and have proven that there are no
extra ending FMVs.  Even if the endings didn't use FMV, this goes
against the design of the main ending.  And despite replaying the game,
no one has yet found a significantly different path to take, (failing
all 4 Huge Materia quests has virtually no effect on the game's course)
nor have they found any other endings.

MY OPINION:
I hate to say it, but it seems that there's only one ending in the game.
I think that there could have been other endings planned, though, even
if they were never actually completed or put on the discs.  I don't know
if people have tried searching Disc 1 or 2 for the alternate endings,
but it seems a little odd to have to switch to an earlier disc to see
an ending sequence, so there may not be any endings on those discs,
either.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Okay then.  Square DID cut stuff out of FF7, for whatever reason.
There WAS going to be more in the game originally, right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SUPPORTS THIS RUMOR:
Just about everything :)  There are disabled Materia in the game,
unused portraits (albeit possible test portraits at that), a seemingly
unfinished ending, and the fact that Disc 3 seems incredibly rushed,
which would be likely considering that Square announced that FF7 would
be a 3-disc game instead of a 2-disc game very late into their
production of the RPG.  There are many graphical glitches that could
have been easily fixed (such as when you view most characters up close),
and both the actual game itself and the mini-games could have used some
playtesting (as people and game reviewers have both said).  One rather
interesting point that no one has yet mentioned is that there are three
spaces for each Limit Break level, both in the Main Menu sub-screens and
on the red window that appears when use use a Limit Break in battle--it
could be that characters were originally going to have extra Breaks, but
this was dropped when the programmers began to run short on time.

WHAT CONTRADICTS THIS RUMOR:
Few games that are designed are ever released exactly the way they
were thought up.  This is due to a number of reasons; lack of money,
time contraints (which Lansing hinted as being the biggest reason why
Square may have cut things out of the game), or lack of interest from
both the programmers and the consumers.  FF7 is a complete game in
terms of being able to play, understand, and beat it, so it was
released in a 'usable' form.  And even using GS codes, it has been
discovered that there are no other Limit Breaks in the games aside
from the ones your characters can normally get in the game.

MY OPINON:
Cuts in the game?  Absolutely!  Like I said above, not every game is
released exactly the way it was intended to, but I think the main
reason why everyone got ticked off about FF7 is because so much was
removed at the last moment.  There's only one ending on the disc, in
my view.  Does that mean that Square never planned any other endings?
Of course not!  In my honest opinion, I do think there were going to
be more hidden characters, and I do think that Square may have toyed
with the idea of being able to revive Aerith.  Just because none of
this is evident in the final version doesn't mean it never happened.
FF7 was put together very hastily and it seems like the programmers
may have changed their minds as to what works and what doesn't
throughout the game.  The 'Materia Select' code and the extra
character portraits show that.  Even if the portraits were just test
images to be used before the real ones were put in, you think the
programmers would clean things up and remove them before putting out
the finished title.  Same for the 'Active Battle' debugger that
happens as a result of the Item Select Game Shark Code.  And the sudden
change from 2 discs to 3 before FF7 was released was also very
convincing--there's only one new area on the third disc.  Everything
else, from the bonus areas to the Ultima Weapon, all show up first on
the second disc.  If you think about it even more, what's the difference
between discs except for FMV?  The 'FMV Viewing Trick' proves that ALL
the discs have the same program on them; I played through several areas
of each disc that would seem specific to that disc with another FF CD in
the PlayStation, and they all loaded and played (like the snowboard and
submarine sequences, which aren't available in Disc 1, or the whole
first few hours of the game, which can't be reached in Disc 2 or 3 since
Area 7 of Midgar City is destroyed early on in Disc 1.)  The only
difference between Disc 1 and 2, and 3 are the FMV files, but all the
discs have at least some of the same FMV on them (the lift in Junon
Town, the observatory in Cosmo Canyon, and the sky lift going to and
from the Gold Saucer are on all three discs, and the bit with the
rotating silver car can be found on Discs 1 and 3, at the least).  So
yeah, I'd say that FF7 definitely has had some parts that were not
implemented and/or cut out for various reasons.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Will FF7 be just like the Japanese version when it is released in
English?  Will anything be added or removed?  Who's handling the
translation if there's no more Squaresoft?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

(All the information below is from PSX Power <www.psxpower.com> except
where mentioned)

Apparently, FF7 _will_ be changed when it is released in the US.  In
addition to the obvious translation of text, the following changes
will be made:

 - 'The overall difficulty setting during battle sequences will be
    balanced.'

Thank goodness for this one!  This means that instead of a single
character being able to wipe out a boss all by him/herself, you might
actually have to _plan_ a strategy in order to win the battle!  The
bad part about this is that the HPs and stats of the monsters will
probably be changed, making my monster list useless *sniff*.

 - 'The interface with the Materia exchange will be improved, allowing
    gamers more choices during gameplay.'

The exact wording of this is a little unclear, but it would seem as if
the Materia system will be altered so as to be a little more user-
friendly.  It's not bad as is, but it could use some improvements, such
as a command to dequip all characters (active or not) of their Materia.
It'd also be nice if you could equip/exchange Materia in battle.  What
really needs reworking is the Item Menu (you can't equip weapons in
battle, like you could in other FF games.  It'll also be interesting to
see what they do about the 'item organizing' commands, since one of them
arranges items according to the Japanese alphabet.)

 - 'Additional "Weapon" monsters have been added.'

Apparently, the two Weapons that you don't fight (the one that attacks
Junon by sea and the one that attacks Midgar by land) will be fightable
in the US version.  Furthermore, if you go to:

        http://www.gamefan.com/hot/archive/7_97/pics/

You can see pictures of a green Weapon running around underwater (and
there's a timer going as well).  There are also pictures of a red
Weapon monster stomping around in the KoreruSabaku (Corel Desert; it's
the huge 'dirt pit' around the Gold Saucer).  You may only be able to
fight this monster via the Buggy or the Highwind.

 - 'A few select scenes have been augmented to clarify the storyline.'

Sony claims that 'no portion of the story has been changed'.  So, it
seems that all that will happen is that many of the unresolved and
unexplained events in FF7 will be made more clear, such as Cloud's
real past, the connection between Sephiroth and the Jenova project,
and other events.  The above statement doesn't mention anything about
repairing the apparently unfinished ending sequence, but perhaps they'll
put in a few lines of text explaining what happens to our heroes after
the end of the game.

 - You will now have 10 spaces to enter a character's name instead of
   six (this info comes straight from the UnOfficial Squaresoft
   Homepage).

Some of you already saw this coming.  After all, 'Sephiroth', 'Vincent',
and 'Cait Sith' are all longer than six letters, when spelled in English.

Furthermore, this modified version of FF7 will also be released in Japan
as well (in Japanese, of course).  Now, this may just be speculation on
my part, but the agreement between Sony and Square (as I see it) is that
nothing that is normally in the game will be removed or altered.  This
does _not_ prevent them from removing the disabled materia, the 'test'
character portrait, and any reference to Aerith's ressurection.  I
wouldn't be surprised if the 'augmented scenes' change includes removing
certain mentions of Aerith's death from Buugen Haagen's conversations,
and I'm sure that the guy standing outside Midgar City in Disc 2 and 3
will have his dialogue re-worded to a certain extent.  This is just my
opinion, but it seems very likely to me, since Sony can do this without
anyone knowing (aside from those of us with GameSharks :))  I had always
been wondering what the translators would do about the disabled stuff
(call it 'dummy' materia, actually translate it into English, or
something else), but it looks like it could just be removed.

The actual translation of the game is being handled by Sony, since
Squaresoft (USA Squaresoft, mind you) has been disbanded ever since
the release of Secret of Evermore some time ago.  However Square is
working in conjunction with Square USA when it comes to adding the
extra stuff (such as the Weapon monsters).

THE DOCUMENTS
=========================================================================

Here are the documents the 'Rumors and Speculaton' section was based
upon (it was also based upon personal experience, use of GS codes, and
newsgroup discussions, particularly in alt.games.final-fantasy).  All
have been edited for space and so that they could fit this guide:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This original document below was located at Miranda's Cafe (the address
is in the Special Thanks section):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           Aerith's Ressurection

                                   NOTICE
                      A) You *cannot* ressurect Aerith
        B) We do not have the required Game Shark Codes to revive her
           C) We have NO FURTHER INFORMATION regarding her revival

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            The True Aeris Story
  This was posted on the FF Discussion Group by Lansing, a temp worker
  for Square who did some of the translations. It lays to rest (finally)
  the rumors of Aerith's ressurection:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh no. They did it. I wouldn't have known, because I had access to the
full set of FF7 info... but they did. I guess this means that I should
have actually played through things to see if anything had changed,
instead of getting tired of the game after translation purposes. I think
everyone is gonna kill me for my insolence, because I really should have
played through the game more fully before I said anything to make sure it
was still possible.

Throughout the past few weeks, I, myself, have been wondering why people
were having such a hard time reviving Aeris, because according to
everything I saw through the scenario translation process, it could be
done fairly easily. Here's the Aeris revival process, in full.

First off, throughout the game, you must make the logical choice of
things to say to Aeris to indicate that you like her. You must never hurt
her in any way by choice. What happens in scenarios, however, cannot be
avoided (Aeris' beating by Cloud, for instance). Also, with the sick man.
There is no medicine, but you could have Aeris tend to him and make him
feel better, by learning about her heritage and returning to Midgar in
the first CD. By doing this, the "GENERAL" as people call him, would
trust you, and request you go buy his dying friend something from the
store. A simple quest. After doing so, the GENERAL would tell you thanks,
and that if there was anything else you need ever, to ask him for help.
You then see a scene with his friend dying. A sad scene. :(

Now, continue through the game as normal, and after Aeris dies, go on to
the second CD. Once here, return to Midgar with the key from CD1, and the
GENERAL will ask you where the nice girl (Aeris) is. You explain that she
has died, by Sephiros, and that there is no hope in reviving her. There
would be a chance, but only if you could go deep under the waters of the
floating castle (where Aeris died). The GENERAL would tell you that he
thinks he may be able to help, and to come back later. After this
meeting, you were to go on to Aeris' church, where there would be a long
scene with her spirit. If you had been nice to her, she would express a
desire to return to help you. After doing this, return to the GENERAL,
who would provide you with a Yellow materia that allowed the entire group
to travel through water. With this, you could return to the floating
palace, go up to Mr. Fish, and once you touched him, you would be
transported under water, to a cavern, where, at the end, lay Aeris'
orb/life essence. With this orb, Bugen Hagen could complete the ress
process, and you could move on to a happier life with a neater ending.

Well, the FMVs were all completed on time, but a lot of coding was not.
They then delayed the games release by a month (Dec -> Jan). However, it
seemed that even by late December, the coding STILL wasn't finished, so
Square told production to wrap it up quickly. In order to get the game
out on time, SqJP sacrificed what could have been a miraculously better
game than FF7... The main coding that was not finished dealt with
manipulating the transparent polygon of Aeris' spirit in the church.
Since they were forced to wrap production up to meet the many-delayed
deadline, they had to stop with the Aeris process unfinished. So, to keep
things from ever happening, they simply removed the one item that allowed
any hint of the process to take place... The Key to Midgar, from the
first CD. This completely stopped the ability to ressurect Aeris.
HOWEVER, they left out the removal of one thing, and that was the split-
second of seeing the ghost of Aeris once you return to the church.
Unforunately, this, along with the insanely big size of the ending MOV,
are the only hints to Aeris' existence that we have. Other than the
original FF7 scriptline, from which all the above information came.

I ran across this info while talking to John H. (another temp like me)
trying to get some US script from him for our channel's page. Also, Seph
wanted it. I asked him if it would be alright for me to release the
script info in an altered form, and to release info on gameplay, such as
Aeris' death/ress. Then he told me the deadline story, and I almost had a
heartattack. He said that the process can still be done to its
completion, sans a couple of scenes, with the Game Shark, but until
someone develops a MOV player that handles multiple sector files, the
true ending will not be seen.

Oh, and about the ending... There were supposed to be scenes with the
hidden characters, but things got cut short, so they weren't added, and
the end of the ending was terrible, without even the typical "THE END" in
the stars.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is part of an email sent to me from James Smith:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  First of all, the game is 'unfinished'. You may have heard rumors of
  thos, but I can swear they are true. The major thing removed was a
  large scenario by which you can revive Aerith. In December, when the
  game development was being finished, Square got a bit lazy and as a
  result just pulled the whole revival process. In fact, the movie files
  and code for the revival all exist on the discs, but a small part where
  you could get the key to Midgar in disc 1 was removed, making the whole
  process impossible. Game Shark allows the parts with her alive again on
  disc 2 and 3 possible, but the two other endings are inaccessible..
  (Yes, there are two endings, one in which Aerith commits suicide)
  Removing the revival also removed the possibility of getting another
  secret character, and imp, which I believe you had on your list as
  KanjiMaru (I've not seen anything much regarding the char, but that he
  had only 1 limit etc.) and strangely, I had heard nothing of 'Kanjimaru
  2'. The chocobo part is another secret in the game. Interestingly, from
  what I've gathered this part may still be accessible, but I'm not yet
  sure. Basically it's a materia that lets you control your chocobos,
  which I've been told is not a very large deal anyway.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Smith's second message is:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In response to your question <KM's note - I had asked how Mr. Smith
  knew Mr. Lansing>, we met about three months or so ago only, (online).
  Because of his relation to Square, he could not reveal the method to
  get Aerith back, that is until he left Square at the end of March.
  Well, the end of March came, and he left Square. Before he did, he was
  talking with a friend about getting some scripts and the full method in
  perfect steps for all the secrets, when his friend told him about the
  whole removal of it. I think it was in your FAQ the bit about seeing
  the ghost of Aerith in the church. Ever noticed how fast the ghost
  dissapears? It doesn't fade, and it's not even there for long. It was
  at this point that an Video sequence was supposed to start. But Square
  just deleted the key, and several parts hinting at her death, but they
  did forget the ghost. Yes, the game will freeze in parts of the second
  disc, but you have noticed that she does in fact have dialog. But there
  is no real point in the discussing the matter. It's impossible in the
  Japanese version, because even with the Gameshark it cannot be viewed
  in it's entirety. And having discussed it with Lansing, it will not be
  fixed for American release anyway. (Or, it is not scheduled to, which
  is unlikely to change) If you'd like to know more about it, I can
  basically tell you pretty much everything you want. The other two
  endings you recieved if:
  1. You revive Aerith and were nice to her through decisions throughout
  the game.
  2. You revive Aerith and were mean to here through decisions throughout
  the game.

  Come to think of it, why isn't Bakuusa's portrait displayed with those
  others? Hmm, that too is a question I need to get some help on. BTW,
  Lansing said that another thing that was 'forgotten' was a portrait of
  Bakuusa on the save game files. The portrait is supposed to appear
  randomly of a 1 in 30 chance, so clearing a slot and saving/deleting
  should find it pretty easily. I'll try to find out more so as to clear
  the confusion.  <KM's note - 'Bakuusa' is the name of the imp/kappa,
  I believe, that was mentioned in the first message.>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's some more info. from Mr. Smith:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, it's been a while since I've talked to you, and I've gained a little
 information on the whole revival process. I hope you will put it in your
 next FAQ, as it clears a few things up and makes me look less like I'm
 just 'spreading rumors' :)

        Lansing left the web permanently. I tried to contact him, but he
 is gone. For those who believe that Aerith was never meant to be
 revived, I do pass along this: Lansing insisted that the second and
 third endings were on the disc. Yet, by using PSXVideo you can plainly
 see that only three ending files (The 'trip' to last boss, the ending,
 and Red XIII segment.) So in at least one place there is no validity to
 his statements. Yet I could be wrong here too. And what of the 'Chocobo
 control' materia? This is not so clear either-- I truthfully don't have
 much knowledge past what anyone else knows--that it's a rumor without
 basis. Additionally, the secret endings, as Lansing said, were that
 Aerith and Tifa argue over Cloud, Aerith attempts suicide, when in the
 mad rush Cloud accidentally kills her. How much does this sound like a
 Square ending? I'm really not so sure. I do however believe strongly
 that Aerith was intended to be revived, and that Kappa/Bakuusa was
 indeed supposed to be there. Does it not make sense? But I think perhaps
 there is true proof that she was intended to be revived. Why the so
 sudden dissapearance in the Church? Why does she have dialog at points
 after her death, but in contrast, why does she only have dialog in
 certain spots? I think we will truly never know-- Square will never
 tell. Yet I believe that in early pictures a 'breathing underwater'
 materia was in fact shown, though you as a reader can verify this just
 as much as any other rumor. Laid to rest, I don't think we'll find much
 more than we now know.  <KM's note - the 'Chocobo control' materia was
 supposedly an item that you could use to make a chocobo join your party
 that you could control in battle sequences.>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's Andrew Vestal's take on the whole Aerith rumor--this document is
no longer at his homepage (the address at the top of the FAQ)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Why Final Fantasy VII is Complete

Many have written me, concerned:

Aerith dies. You can't bring her back.

You ask that I start a petition--after all, my first one worked! Square
rushed the game, you say, and released it before it was finished.
Originally, you could bring her back! Make Square give us the TRUE Final
Fantasy VII!

And I smile and politely go about my day's business. But, lately, I have
received too many of these letters to ignore them, and I must I make my
views known.

Square is a video game publisher: they make games. Why? To make money.
But, then, why are movies made? TV shows aired? Books published? Magazines
written? Newspapers produced? For the same reason: to make money. Only a
fool, however, would argue that no important movie or book had ever been
made. Rightful works of art have appeared in each medium. And Square has
done more than any other video game publisher to move video games out of
the realm of mere children's entertainment and into their rightful place
alongside other media.

Square delayed the release of Final Fantasy VII by a full month. They have
also delayed the release of Final Fantasy Tactics, SaGa Frontier, Bushido
Blade, and Tobal 2. Every Playstation game announced to date! Their
profits for the year took a serious hit. Their stock value wavered. Yet
the games were delayed because a substandard product would not be worthy
of the Square name.

But Square, sadly, can't delay games forever. Final Fantasy VI's ending
was originally to have an Amano sketch for each character, but cartridge
limitations demanded they be cut. Chrono Trigger's End of Time was to be
majestic and crystalline. Characters such as Janus and Schala were,
tragically, cut at the last moment. And who knows what other parts of
Square's games never made the final cut? Square cannot always put
everything they want into a game; eventually, they must say "the game is
finished" and release it.

Some still insist the game is unfinished. I should start a petition to
demand the game be "fixed," they say. These people misunderstand the
power of the petition.

The Final Fantasy VII Translation Petition asked for fair and equitable
treatment. It asked that the game not be censored or cut; that it remain
in its original form; that Americans receive, finally, a Final Fantasy
game the way it was written. The petition was succesful, and I am proud
to have supported it, because it asked for justice.

A petition to demand the insertion of Aerith's ressurection, however,
would ask for preferencial treatment. It would selfishly demand more than
others have already received. It would ask Square to retouch a finished
product at gamers' whims. It would ask for these things out of greed, and
I cannot support it.

Square offers you the Venus de Milo, and you would send it back because it
has no arms.

There are rumors that an alternative, superior ending exists, unaccessible
because of Aerith's permanent death. Those rumors are nothing but LIES.
The ending you see is the ending Square originally intended: the largest
movie file on the third disc. The ending, as well, is perfectly
satisfactory; there's nothing "lackluster" about it. A "better" ending
(with Aerith ressurected) is an impossibility. If she had been
ressurected, then she would commit suicide before the end. This is true!
Cloud would try to stop her and fail, for her death is inevitable. Aerith
knew her death was absolutely necessary. Do not presume to know more than
she.

And most importantly . . . Aerith should stay dead.

    A dying man needs to die, as a sleepy man needs to sleep, and
    there comes a time when it is wrong, as well as useless, to resist.
         - Steward Alsop

Aerith's death is a tragedy. I truly do believe this. So was Tellah's. So
was General Leo's. So was the death of every person who ever sacrificed
themselves for a greater cause. But unlike deaths in previous Square
games, Aerith's death carries long-lasting repercussions that echo long
after her passing. For Aerith did not die senselessly. Aerith meant to
die.

      Some people are so afraid to die that they never begin to live.
           - Henry Van Dyke

Aerith knew her actions would mean her end. But she faced death anyway,
aware that only in death could she avert the coming disaster and save her
world. She gave her life intentionally, purposefully, and with full
knowledge of the consequences. No one ever, EVER forgets that; the
tragedy of her loss is what keeps the small party together.

                 Do not go gentle into that good night
                 Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                      - Dylan Thomas

Even in death her presence is felt. Her memory guides and leads the party
on its quest. Her spirit appears in silent reminder of her selfless act.
Aerith died. She died! And she died honorably.

               Dear, beauteous death, the jewel of the just!
                    - Henry Vaughan

If Prince Hamlet came back from the dead, would his indecision be
meaningful? If King Lear recovered, would we learn from his folly? And if
Aerith were disinterred mere hours after her death, would her sacrifice
have any importance? Square should be honored that the death of a
character brings about this outcry. It is touching testament to the
games' power: the characters are truly loved. And grief is a natural
reaction to the death of a loved one. As is denial. Now, Square fans
must proceed to the next stage: acceptance.

    Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep.
    I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glint on snow.
    I am the sun on ripened grain. I am the soothing, gentle rain.
    When you awake in morning hush, I am the swift uplifting rush
    Of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the stars that shine at night.
    Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there. I did not die.
         - Anonymous

Aerith Gainsborough gave her life so that the world might live. May she
rest in peace.

                       . . . she smiled, in the end.
                            - Cloud Strife

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, here's some speculation about the 'disabled' Materia Orbs and
the Aerith rumor from Ian Kelley:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Materia

11. Suichu Kokyu
16. Booster
???? I have no clue whatsoever what the hell either of these Materia do.
My best guess is that they were materias thought up very early in
the gamemaking process, and were scrapped very early on, since neither of
them seems to have abilities that make any sense whatsoever. I was a
little intrigued by the Suichu Kokyu one so I did a little investigation
on that using my computer...I'll talk about it later.

26. Housoku
This is great! I cracked up when I saw this one. It's a joke materia put
in by the programmers. "Housoku" means "Law" in the sense of what lawyers
do. The skill given was "Zeninage" (Throw money) so I guess the
programmers are trying to say you have to throw away your money if you
want to hire a lawyer. Hehehe...^_^

3F Mabarrier
42 Reflek
43 Refuab(???)
These were all pretty interesting. It gives you insight onto how the
programmers initially intended to make the Barrier type spells. The first
teahces you "Mabarrier" 3 times...obviously not a finished Materia, like
Booster. The description says it allows you to cast "Mabarrier."

Reflek teaches you "Reflek" and "Wall," and Refuab (whatever the hell
that's supposed to be) teaches you Wall.

My best guess is this: When they first started programming the game, they
wanted to have all of the spells on the "Barrier" Materia that is
actually used on separate Materia. Then they decided to put Reflek and
Wall together on one materia, then just gave up and put Barrier,
Mabarrier, Reflek, and Wall all on one Materia, the one we see in the
game itself. If you do a little searching I bet you will find a Materia
with just "Barrier" on it, and maybe a Materia with Barrier + Mabarrier
on it.

Now for the stuff on the Suichu Kokyu Materia...
This interested me, cause for a moment I actually thought that Square was
being stupid enough at some point to actually be thinking about having
Aerith be ressurectable. Therefore, I booted up my Disk Block Editor on
my computer, and since I have Japanese system software on my computer, I
converted the ASCII values of each of the blocks to Japanese fonts so I
could read the dialogue. And this is what I found that is *really*
interesting:

It took me an hour, but I eventually found the section where Bugenhargen
is in the place where Aerith died. Around that area, I found some lines
of dialogue that I don't remember before.
(I am paraphrasing this cause I don't remember the lines verbatim)

1. "But at the floor of the ocean is impossible..."
The middle of this sentence started at the beginning of a sector but the
previous sector did not have the first part of the sentence...possibly
this could be if that the Ascii values for a single character get split
in half it turns the first part into garble, and it might have split the
character in the sector before. Either that, or the beginning of the
sentence is stored in another sector. Anyhow, this came just like 2
sectors before the sentence where they talked about whatever the hell it
was you needed at the bottom of the ocean.

2. "[The] White Materia is necessary", literally.
This was about 10 sectors or so after the first line I don't remember.
Since this could mean anything, it might have been there before and I
just don't remember.

<KM's note - He actually says something like this in the game, I think,
although mind you that I don't know much Japanese.>

Anyhow, after seeing this, I have some possible theories for the purpose
of the Suichu Kokyu Materia. There's not a hell of a lot of evidence, but
my guess is that either:
1) The materia is needed to leave the submarine to get the key or
whatever the hell it was underwater that you needed to get. Either that,
or the programmers initially intended for you to go underwater some way
other than the sub to get that key.
2) The materia is needed to get at the White Materia that dropped into
the Water right after Aerith gets killed.

I think the first theory makes more sense, since I found no dialogue
evidence towards a search or subquest for the White Materia, but it does
seem awfully strange that during that FMV sequence they show us in minute
detail whatis happening to the White Materia, when you would think that
they would be focusing on Aerith, who is in the process of dying. ^_^ My
best bet though is that that Materia would be needed to let you get out
of the sub, either to retrieve the key or whatever, or enter the sunken
plane.  It does make sense...after all, the monsters in the sunken plane
are stronger than most of the monsters in the last dungeon, yet you get
access to that place towards the beginning of Disk 2. If there was
supposed to be some key to getting in there that you could only get
*after* getting the sub, it might make sense, and the Suichu Kokyu
Materia would be a prime contender IMO for that key, if such a situation
really were to exist. Of course, this is all just conjecture. It is
really interesting though, and I plan to do more research...including
finding the exact address values of any fishy dialogue I see. It's cool,
with those earlier Barrier Materias, you can see how the programmers
planned the game mechanics to go one way, then changed their minds. It's
a waste of space though to leave stuff like that in; they should have
just deleted it.

And oh yeah, one other thing...a search for the ascii values of
the word "Fukkatsu" (Revive, bring back to life, etc.) turned up nothing
that had anything to do with Aerith...I guess the rumor about her
ressurection being possible in any way, shape, or form was just some guy
jumping to conclusions. Oh well, I guess it's more dramatic anyway to
have her die and stay dead anyway. And it wouldn't make sense to have
Square revive a dead character in one of their games, that's not like
them anyway. The closest they came to that was in Chrono Trigger, but
that was less a revival and more of a "jump in time + grab him before he
gets killed" kind of thing.

<KM's note - Like I said, these are just people's opinions...let's not
get on their case because of whatever they did/didn't say, okay?  No one
except for the programmers at Square know the real truth behind the game,
and I don't think they'll be saying anything anytime soon ^_^;>

   This guy took the time to write the FF5 walkthrough, which saved a lot
   of us gamers from going insane trying to beat what is probably the
   hardest RPG ever made.  His work is what inspired me to write this FAQ
   in the first place.

*  Thanks also goes to Doctor976@aol.com and rupe@email.unc.edu for
   providing some info about getting Aerith's Limit Break, too).

*2 Also, thanks to Eddy <eddy@rica.net> for providing a link to
   phosphors' site soon after the instruction booklet was translated.

Anybody who sends me information that I don't already have (and can use
in the FAQ) is given credit in the Special Thanks section.  If I come
across some information that I'd like to use, I'll e-mail that person
and ask for permission.  However, if I don't get a response, then I'll
use it anyway.  So if you see your work up here and it says 'taken
without permission' that means that I've already e-mailed you asking
if I could use it.  I'm not trying to disrespect contributors, though,
and if this happens to you and you have a problem with it, drop me a
line...no offense is intended.  Also, if anyone in this section doesn't
want their e-mail address or URL shown, drop me a line and I'll gladly
change it in the next update.

Let's not forget the list of idiots!
 - J. Banks
 - fu1997@ix.netcom.com
 - Skankin Pickles
 - kairi@pixi.com

The first two sent my 'No Time Limit' code to other sites and took
credit from it--they copied the code description _word for word_ from
the FAQ.  Skankin Pickles decided he could rip from the walkthrough
more than once, and kairi@pixi.com sent his 'own' Body Heat code to a
FF7 site.  Had he made the code himself, he'd know why the title is
a little misleading :)  This list is supposed to discourage people
from doing this kind of thing.  It's not so they can see their names
in someone's FAQ!

After writing fighting-game FAQs, doing this one really blew me away.
It's hard to get everything straight.  Be sure to read the introduction
to understand just how this FAQ is set up.  Also, some information in
this FAQ is taken from the translation of the FF7 instruction booklet
and is therefore written down word for word, even if there are spelling
or grammatical mistakes.  I _may_ make major changes to this FAQ when I
pick up the American version, but I may just keep everything the way it
is and start an 'English' FAQ instead.  Remember, you can't play this
game unless you use the 'swap' trick (there's info on how to do this at
CGN's web site listed above), or have a modification chip installed into
your PlayStation (unless you live in CA, I can't recommend a place to
you...you could always try NCS, though).  Furthermore, knowing Japanese
is a big help (not that I would know ;-)).

Well, the first page to rip from my FAQ finally called it quits.  That
doesn't mean this reminder is any less important; it is the reason why
I've had to change the disclaimer so many times.  Making this FAQ is
hard work and nothing but, so please acknowledge the author and
contributors if you use something from either part of the FAQ, okay?

That's that.
