                        "Information" section.



================
2.  Introduction
================

Two years after the release of Square's mega hit Final Fantasy VII two
Gameshark hackers known as RPGod an CzarDragon have discovered a code for
access to the Debug Room.  It is very confusing so I wrote this faq to shed
some light.


===============
3.  Information
===============

To get into this room you do NEED a Gameshark, without it getting into the
room is impossible.  The code is 8009A05C 0041.  When you get to the "NEW
GAME/Continue?" screen start a new game and switch off the Gameshark.  I do
not suggest that you use one of your files to get to the room, so do like me
and take out your memory card(s) before doing any of this, and I CAN'T help
you with any problems with you saved game files.  There are 10 different 
rooms to go to from the beginning.  The debug room is set up like this:

=================      The circles are in Japanese Kanji so I'll label the
|       o              rooms by numbers. The top circle is room 1, in the
|    o     o           next row is room 2 and room 3, the next is room 4 and
| o           o        room 5, and so on. The vertical line beside room 6 is
|    o|    o           Yuffie she gives you various options.  If you go to 
|       o              the right you end up outside Midgar.  The top line 
=================      leads to room 9 and the bottom one leads to room 10.

Press Select on the controller if you are in a new room and you might get 
some new options.  Make sure that you turn OFF the Gameshark before going 
to a room or else you'll just go to the debug room again it'll just be all 
black.  You can go back to the debug room by turning on the Gameshark and 
going to a new screen.  The debug room will look screwed up but it's still 
the same.  There is alot of glitches in this room and sometimes it might 
freeze so beware.  If you go to a scene and go off the screen when the 
gameshark is on and it's supposed to lead to the world map it won't go 
there, it will go to the snowfield part with the flags and even if the
gameshark is off you could still end up at the northwest coner of the map
in the water so you'll be stuck and you'll have to reset.  If you are in a
battle do not turn on the gameshark because it'll lead to a Game Over,
battling on the World map could be dangerous because it'll sometimes leave
you stuck, even if the gameshark is off, so you'll have to reset.  If you
get to a part where you have to change party members and it's only Cloud
you have, the game won't continue since you have to have 3 people in the
party, so you'll have to reset.  Also there are some parts in the game where
a movie takes place, depending on which disc the movie supposed to be there
will be a different movie if a different disc is in, example:  The opening
movie is on disc one but if you change the disc to disc two before it comes
the movie will be when the Diamond Weapon's shot seen going through the
screen.  So experiment with the discs.  I've even found a hidden movie, I
think, I've never seen it before so I guess it's hidden.  For information go
to Room 1, President Shinra.

As for the characters Cloud's name is sometimes Ex-SOLDIER sometimes 
Ex-SOLDIE, Cait Sith has no name it's a blank or sometimes it's Ketcy.  
Yuffie's name is sometimes Yufi.  Barret's is sometimes Ballet.  Aeris or 
Aerith's is sometime Earith.  Vincent's is sometimes Vince.  Sephiroth's 
picture is sometimes Vincent's on the status screen and vice-versa.  Cloud
starts off a level 6.  Vincent starts at level 50 and everyone else starts
at level 1.  Of course you can change all this.

The options are set up like this:

Aeris' options: <--------- the person you talk to for access to options
===============

sleep forest--------- Aeris in Sleeping Forest scene (Sleeping Forest)
^                     ^                               ^
|                     |                               |
name of option        what it does                    where it takes place   

??? means I don't know what it does but it acts like a cancel option.  -s- 
means the button square on the controller and -R1- means R1, If it says any
of these next to the option it means if you hold it before and when it's
loading it'll lead to a different scene.  If it says (stuck) that means 
that you can't move and you have to reset.  My Final Fantasy VII discs are 
screwed up, every time it freezes I have to switch discs, so some stuff 
might be wrong.  If anyone has any information on the room that I haven't 
already listed please e-mail me.

There is also an improved debug code, here it is:
8009ABF6 0041

Pros:
* No more snowy wasteland! The Debug Room is still loaded
* No more garbage! The Debug Room background is loaded

Cons:
* Not activated by New Game or Load Game

Using both codes simultaneously seems to work.  Remember these are for the
North American release of FF7.  Big thanks to CzarDragon.

15. Room 10
===========

This is the weirdest room.  When you arrive it gives you two options:
     For those in a hurry
     For those with a little time
If you pick the first one it'll lead you to more options, if you pick the
second one it'll be like a cancel and you can walk and talk to the other
people in this room.  There are three people in this room.  In the first row
is a giant Aeris and a doctor, in the second is a nurse.  Everybody except
Red XIII have different names.  If you go near Aeris the floor will talk 
saying:
     Huh? You're not thinking of...
     stepping on me are you?
     -
     I may be a floor but that
     dont give you the right!!
Walk a little closer to her and the floor'll say:
     Eyaaaah!!
     OWW, OWW, OWW......
     YEOOWWW......!!
