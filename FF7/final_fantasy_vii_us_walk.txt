  2.  INTRODUCTION
=========================================================================

This FAQ is split into two parts; the one you're reading is the main
walkthrough, while the second part contains mostly lists of items,
monsters, etc.  You can get the _latest_ version of this FAQ at my
page (refer to the top of the FAQ), so please get it as practically
no one does these days :(  This guide is for the American version of
Final Fantasy VII.  While I encourage you to use it if you need help
on the Japanese version of FF7, Final Fantasy VII International, or the
PC version of FF7, expect there to be some minor differences in what's
written here and what occurs in the game.  Don't mail me about the PC
version of FF7, please!  I have no way of playing it, so if I'm unable
to confirm any info., it's pointless to tell me about it.  

If you're reading a version of this FAQ that has been translated,
HTML'ized, or whatever, please send all inquiries to those people who
did the changes and not me, as they may have an older version or have
added their own corrections and I won't be able to help you.  The ones
of particular note are:

I recall that some other people were translating this FAQ into Spanish,
Portugese, and other languages.  If they could mail me the URLs of
their translated FAQs, I'll add them here.

I _WILL NOT_ answer any gameplay related questions about this game.
It's not because I'm a prick (haha, I know), but because you wouldn't
believe the types of questions I get.  95% of them can be answered by
reading the FAQ.  Yes, I know it's large, but that's because there's
so much information in here, so just sit down and start reading instead
of giving up and mailing me.  If you want to put this FAQ on your page,
or want to alter it, you need not mail me, as long as you keep the
copyright and disclaimer intact.  If there is some sort of legal thing
going on with this FAQ, then I would like to hear from you (especially
if you've spotted this FAQ being plagarized in any sort of publication,
sadly, it has happened).  You can reach me at: <kmegura@yahoo.com>.


=========================================================================
  3.  DISC ONE WALKTHROUGH
=========================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.1  makoro power plant
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion x3, Phoenix Down, Restore materia,
                     Assault Gun.

At the start of the game, you'll have 3 Potions, a Phoenix Down, and an
Ether.  You can't equip Materia until after you reach the 7th Heaven
bar, by the way.

Once you leave the train, check the body of the closest guard twice to
get two Potions.  Then head north.  You'll be attacked by some guards.
Take them out with your sword (you may win a Potion for killing them)
and then move left to go outside.  Now, talk to your teammates (Biggs,
Wedge, and Jessie), then name yourself and Barret.  Make your way to the
northwestern door, and head up in the next room to enter the heart of
the power plant.

Talk to Barret, (who joins you) and then talk to each Avalanche member
to open the doors.  After opening the second door, head right to enter
another chamber with a treasure chest (Phoenix Down).  Then, go back
and enter the elevator (you'll have to talk to Jessie first).  Press the
arrow switch to activate it.

Work your way down the stairs and go through the door to the left.  Then
follow Jessie down the ladder.  When she stops, search the area in front
of her for a Potion (it's hard to see because of the steam).  Climb
down, cross the pipes, descend the nearby ladder, and take note of
the Save Point before heading down the walkway.

Pick up the Restore materia on the ground in the next area and set the
bomb.  An alarm will sound and you'll have to fight the boss, a huge
scorpion-like machine.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: GUARD SCORPION                          LV: ??  HP: 800  MP: 0

Cloud's Bolt magic works well, while Barret should be attacking.  The
Search Scope won't damage you, it just warns as to who the boss will
attack next.  When you've done enough damage, the boss will start to
shake and Cloud will warn Barret.  From this point onward, don't attack
the boss and heal yourself or simply guard until the boss attacks you.
If you try to hurt it during this time, the boss responds with a damaging
laser ray shot from his tail.  A few more hits after it stops shaking and
the boss dies.  You'll get an Assault Gun when you kill it.
_________________________________________________________________________

You now have ten minutes to escape from the power plant.  You'll need
to make your way back to the upside-down T-shaped entrance hall where
one of the Avalanche members is waiting.  (If you've played the demo
disc, know that you don't need to 'search' for the other members; just
talk to Jessie to free her and then get out.  Since Barret gets a new
gun after the battle, be sure to equip it.  Also, talk to the other
members to open the two doors on your way back.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.2  midgar city
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion.

After the Avalanche members blow up the passage, head up the stairs.
You'll meet Aeris here, but she won't join you yet.  In the next
screen, there's a Potion to the southwest of the circular structure
(near the lampposts).  Walk south when you're done.  In this next area,
you'll meet up with guards and have the choice of running (bottom
choice) or fighting (top choice).  After a few more encounters with the
Shinra guards, Cloud'll jump onto the passing train and run into the
Avalanche gang.  After talking to them, walk to the 'front' of the
screen and you'll jump off into another area.  Talk to the people here
and one of the members (Jessie) will show you a picture of the Makoro
plant on the train's screen.  Approach Barret and you'll end up going
to the group's base.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.3  avalanche base
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  1500 gil, All materia, Ether.

Head west and go upwards.  Talk to the kid by the fence, then head west
again (there's a Save Point nearby, too).  Talk to the people here,
then check out the bar.  At the top of the tallest building in the south-
east is a bedroom.  The kid here will let you spend the night for 10 gil.

In the bar, you'll meet Tifa, who is also a member of Avalanche, as well
as Marlene, who is supposedly Barret's daughter.  After naming Tifa,
Barret shows up when you try to leave and reveals the hidden base
underneath the bar.  After talking to Barret, Tifa shows up.  Leave the
base and you'll have a short intermission with Tifa.   When you meet
Barret afterwards, he'll give you 1500 gil.  If you go to the Beginner's
Hall above the Weapon Shop outside, you can learn more about playing the
game.  You'll also find that there inside the huge cage.  The man in
the right corner of this room has a Materia by his feet (All).  Take it
and a chest will drop down that has an Ether inside of it.  If you
haven't already noticed, the two buildings that were locked the other
day are now open.

When you're ready, go back to the train station to prepare for
Avalanche's next mission.  If you like, you can go to the far right to
enter a train yard, but there's not much of interest there.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.4  mako reactor number five
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Hi-Potion, Ether x2, Potion, Tent, Titan Bangle.

Board the train.  When the timer appears after you talk to Tifa, talk
to the homeless man in the back of the screen to get a Phoenix Down.
In the second car, talk to the man closest to the 'front' of the screen
and pick the top option to get a Hi-Potion.  In the third car, a man
will walk past you, snicker, and steal from you; follow him and talk to
him again to get back the gil he just swiped.  Keep going through each
train car until Tifa jumps off one of the cars and you and Barret follow
her.  If this occurs on the last car, talk to the man at the very end to
get a Hi-Potion.  After jumping off, you'll end up in an underground
railroad passageway.  If you go south (towards the 'front' of the
screen), you'll go through the same screen 5 times before coming to two
guards who you can fight.  When the battle's over, choose the bottom
option to keep fighting or the top option to run away.  You can fight
the same battle over and over, so when you get tired of fighting, just
pick the top option.  An OK place to gain some experience, gil, and AP,
if you think you'll need it.

Anyway, it's a lot faster to just head north to where the green barrier
is and go down the hatch to the west (examine it and choose the top
choice twice or the middle option once).  Pick up the Ether in the
adjoining passage, climb down the two ladders, and talk to Wedge.  Then
go up the ladder near him to reach a room where Jessie is waiting for
you.  Take the Potion that's next to her and climb down the ladder on the
far left end of the room to reach a chamber where you can find a Tent, a
Save Point, and Biggs.

Go up the ladder here to reach the No. 5 Reactor.  The room you're in
should be familiar.  Slide down the pipe and then work your way back to
the heart of the plant.  After Cloud fiddles with the machinery, go back
to the large room and climb up the stairs and into the elevator.  It'll
take you to a new floor.  Grab the contents of the treasure chest outside
(Ether) and then head to the left where there are three control panels.
You'll need to hit your panel as the same time Barret and Tifa hit
theirs (using the O button), so give it a shot.  Instead of waiting for
them to raise their arms, you'll have an easier time if you time it so
that you hit your panel _just_ before they do.  You can't use the panel
if you didn't go back to the heart of the power plant.  Afterwards, go
through the opened gate (there's a Save Point here), and head north.

In the T-shaped room, you'll be stopped by a group of guards, and then
meet President Shinra.  After that, a helicopter and a hydrofoil-like
machine show up.  The Shinra president leaves in the helicopter, but
the huge machine attacks you and your friends.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: AIR BUSTER                             LV: 15  HP: 1200  MP: 0
                                                  weak against Lightning

This machine turns to face (and attack) whomever hits it.  So, if one of
your characters is low on life, have the person on the opposite side
attack to draw the boss' attention away.  Be especially careful of it's
Big Bomber--it causes tons of damage  (but also increases your Limit
meter quickly).  Remember that even if it's back is turned, it can use a
weak machine gun attack on you.  Use potions and the Restore Materia to
keep up your HPs and use Bolt as well as your Limit Break attacks to take
this machine out.  You'll receive a Titan Bangle if you win the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.5  sector 5 slums
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  5 gil or Turbo Ether, Potion, Phoenix Down, Cover
                     materia, Ether.

After the battle, the boss will explode, sending Cloud off the walkway
in the ensuing blast.  When you awake, you'll find yourself in a church.
Aeris is here, and you can name her after talking to her several times.
Reno shows up afterwards with some guards.  In the next room, Aeris
falls down while trying to escape with Cloud.  Tell her to hold on.
You now have the option of fighting the guards using Aeris or trying to
bean the guards on the head with barrels on the upper floor (if you
miss, you'll have to fight using Aeris anyway).  Remember, she starts off
in the back row, so to increase damage, make her move up by choosing
'Change' at the start of each battle (do this by pressing left, then the
O button).

The correct order of barrels to drop is: the leftmost barrel (in the
back), the far right barrel (in the back), and the far right barrel
(in the front).  Simply tell Aeris to hold on each time, examine each
barrel, and choose the top option to drop it.  This way, Aeris won't
have to fight anybody.  When Aeris meets you at the top of the chapel,
she'll hook up with Cloud.

In the upper area, climb up the second beam on the left and jump out of
the hole in the roof.  After you and Aeris make it back to ground level,
head left to find a Save Point.  To the northwest is a town.  Be sure to
meet the man in the pipe near the entrance.  In one of the houses, you
can also find 5 gil if you talk to the drunk man in bed, then examine
the drawers nearby, however, if you don't take the gil, he'll give you
a Turbo Ether when you return here after Sector 7 is destroyed.

There are several stores here in the slums, including one that sells
Materia.  To the far, far right is a path that leads to Aeris's house
and a garden.   You can spend the night here once you've met Elmyra,
Aeris' mother.  When you wake up, look between the desk and the bed for
a Potion and a Phoenix Down.  Then, sneak downstairs (or Aeris will make
you go back to bed) and leave the house (you can do this by not touching
the walls and not running, either).  In the lower flower bed to the
right, you can get a Cover materia and an Ether. There's another Save
Point near Aeris' house if you need to use it.

Leave the town and go left to the hole in the wall.  Aeris will be here
waiting for you and will rejoin you.  In the next location, work your
way upward (by going across the hole-filled metal length, then down the
iron beams and through the passage, then up the brown pipe and finally
down the stairs and heading to the left).  After Aeris leaves you at the
playground, head east, then go north to arrive at the Wall Market.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.6  wall market
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Phoenix Down, Hyper.

Aeris rejoins you (again) here.  There's a Save Point in the upper-right
part of the village.  The building in the lower left is an inn, where you
can spend the night for 10 gil.  To the right of it is the entrance to a
brothel.  The building in the middle has nothing in it but a computer.
(If you touch it, a machine gun will fire at you and Cloud jumps away.
You can't do anything here until later).  Just above that building is an
item shop.  North of the shop is a sushi bar.  Finally, there is a
clothing store to the upper left and some sort of pottery store to the
upper right.  A path by the clothing store leads to another part of town.
Here, there is a gym, a restaurant, and a weapon shop.  In the northern
area lies a large building.  If you go east from here, you'll reach a
dead-end area.

Your objective in this part of the game is to sneak into the large
building where Tifa is being kept.  To do this, Cloud will have to
dress up as a woman in order to get inside since men aren't allowed
into the building.  So, follow these steps to get the items you need
to 'alter' Cloud's appearance.  You may want to read this entire
section before starting so that you'll know how your choices will
affect the game.

a)  Go to the brothel and talk to the big guy with silver hair who's
    chatting with the bouncer at the door.  Talk to him and pick the
    first option to inquire about Tifa.

b)  Go back to the building at the end of town (Corneo's mansion) and
    talk to the guy near the door.  Aeris and Cloud will move away and
    have a short conversation.  She tells Cloud that he'll have to
    dress up if he wants to find out if Tifa's okay.

c)  Return to the first screen, go to the clothing store, and talk to
    the store owner by standing near the bottom edge of the counter.
    She'll tell you that you can't get a dress unless you do something
    about her drunk father.

d)  Go to the bar in the second screen and talk to the lone man by the
    door.  During the conversation, you'll have to make two decisions.
    So when you're asked a question, pick either the first or second
    choice.  After you're done talking to the man, return to the
    clothing store.

e)  At the store, you'll see that the man from the inn is now behind
    the counter.  Talk to him and you'll receive an item based upon
    your decisions:

    - If you answered: first choice, first or second choice, you'll
      get the Cotton Dress.
    - If you answered: second choice, first choice, you'll be given
      the Satin Dress.
    - If you answered: second choice, second choice again, he'll give
      you the Silk Dress.

f)  Cloud will try on the dress, but won't actually wear it.  Leave
    the clothing store and go to the second screen.  Enter the gym
    and converse with the woman (heh) by the fighting ring.  When you
    have the chance, pick the bottom option twice to start fighting,
    although if you want to practice, you can choose the bottom
    option, then the top one.  Anyway, as soon as the message box
    disappears, start pressing the S, X, and O buttons repeatedly in
    that order.  The object of the game is to go fast enough to make
    Cloud do more squats than the African gymnast, but you don't want
    to press the buttons too fast or Cloud can't keep up.  It's not
    too hard to win since the other guy will often stop to scratch his
    head, but you only have 30 seconds, so get in as many squats as you
    can.

    - If you are able to do more squats than the gymnast, you'll be
      given the Blonde Wig.
    - If you and the gymnast have the same score, the lady will give
      you the Dyed Wig.
    - If the gymnast does better than you, then the lady will give
      you the Wig.

At this point, you can just return to the clothing shop and enter the
stall; Cloud will dress up as a woman and you can return to Corneo's
mansion to get inside.  You can also choose to not change yet and
explore more of the Wall Market, picking up items that you can use to
make Cloud more 'feminine'.  If you're finished, then skip down a ways
to find out what to do next.  Otherwise, keep reading (these events
can be done in any order):

g)  Go to the pottery shop.  When you have to choose an answer, pick
    the top one twice.  (You can't talk to him unless you chatted with
    the guard at the north building).  Then go to the inn and pay 10 gil
    to spend the night.  In the middle of the night, you'll find
    yourself in front of the vending machine in the outer hallway.  Pick
    any option (I hope you have enough gil).  The next morning, return
    to the pottery shop and talk to the man to get an item:

    - If you bought the first item (200 gil), he'll give you the
      Diamond Tiara.
    - If you bought the second item (100 gil), he'll give you the
      Ruby Tiara.
    - If you bought the third item (50 gil), he'll give you the
      Glass Tiara.

    (Note that the dialogue here was changed from the Japanese version,
    in which you were buying a 'gift' for the shopkeeper's girlfriend
    that he was too embarrassed to buy <can you guess?>  Why this was
    changed, I have no idea.)

h)  Enter the sushi bar and walk past the empty seat.  When a message
    appears, choose the top option.  Then choose any option, (you'll
    need 70 gil), followed by the middle choice ("the food was all
    right") to get a Pharmacy Coupon.  Now go to the item store and
    talk to the man behind the counter.  Choose one of the three
    options to get an item, then head back to the restaurant.  Go to
    the bathroom and talk to the woman inside.  Accept the first choice
    and:

    - You'll get the Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
      Disinfectant.
    - You'll get the Flower Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
      Deodorant.
    - You'll get the Sexy Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
      Digestive (medicine).

i)  Talk to the large man in the white shirt who's standing near the
    edge of the screen in the first area to get the Member's Card.
    He won't give it to you unless you talked to the guard by the door
    of the Corneo's mansion. Head right to arrive at the brothel.
    If you talk to the bouncer, he'll let you in once he sees the Card,
    but Aeris won't come with you (yes, they messed up the dialogue
    here, too).

    Inside the Honeybee Inn, you'll find that the doors on the right side
    are locked, but if you chose the bottom option, you can look inside
    them and peer around using the control pad and the O button.  If you
    look in the upper-right keyhole, you'll see a familiar face...a small
    version of Cait Sith!  If you go to the north room and talk to the
    farthest girl on the right several times, you can choose the top
    option to make her dance faster and faster.  When you're ready (you
    better brace yourself), you can do one or the other:

    Examine the lower-left door and pick the top option twice.  In the
    room, talk to the girl and pick the top option three times to take
    a soak with Mukki and his friends.  Answer however you like while
    in the tub and Cloud will be given the Bikini briefs.

    Or, examine the upper-left door and pick the top option twice.
    Inside, talk to the ghostly Cloud near the stone tub and Cloud
    will have a psychotic episode.  When you come to, all your HP
    and MP is restored, thanks to...Mukki :(  Talk to him and choose
    the bottom option.  Then talk to the girl and you'll get the
    Lingerie.

    After getting either item, you can return to the room where all
    the girls are and one will put makeup on you.

All done?  There's nothing left to do now but return to the clothing
store and dress up as a woman.  When you finish, go to the large building
in the north and talk to the man by the food carts again.  He'll let you
into a posh-looking parlor.  Now, go up the stairs and into the door on
the far left after talking to the receptionist.  Then, go down the
staircase to the torture room (!) where you'll find Tifa and an Ether by
the smoldering coals.  Once she's joined you, head back up the stairs
and go into the middle door.  Inside is Tifa's kidnapper, the nefarious
Don Corneo.  He will examine each of you when you try to approach him.
Who he picks for his 'friend' is determined by what items you collected
in the Wall Market:

 - He'll pick Cloud if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and
   have the 'best' extra items (the Diamond Tiara, Sexy Cologne, and
   Lingerie or Bikini briefs.
 - He'll pick Aeris if you're wearing the Silk Dress, the Blonde Wig,
   the Lingerie and the Sexy Cologne (in addition to anything else you
   may have).
 - He'll pick Tifa if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and one
   or two of the extra items not mentioned above (or anything worse than
   that).

If Corneo picked Tifa or Aeris, then read below:

In the next room, examine the item bag by the bed to get a Phoenix Down,
and talk to the man by the television set after talking to the other
henchmen.  After revealing your true nature to the love-struck goons,
they'll fight you.  This is followed by another fight with the other
three punks.  Afterward, get Aeris from the torture chamber and then
go into the middle door again (if Aeris was picked, then you'll meet
Tifa when you go outside).  When you're through intimidating Corneo,
look behind his bed for a Hyper, then stand by your allies.  He'll
make you choose one of three options.  No matter which one you choose,
you'll fall through a trapdoor.

If Corneo picked Cloud, then you'll end up in his room.  Search behind
his bed for a Hyper, then talk to him and answer anyway you like (if
you try to make Cloud kiss Corneo, then maybe you need to get out of
the house more....^_^;)  Your friends will burst in and threaten him
(yeowch!)  and Corneo will ask you a question; pick any answer you
like and you'll still plummet to the sewers below.

  3.7  the sewers / train yard revisited
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion x4, Phoenix Down, Steal materia,
                     Hi-Potion x3, Echo Screen, Ether x2.

Once the cut scene with the Shinra flunkies ends, you'll find yourself
in a sewer.  Before talking to Tifa or Aeris, climb up the stairs to
the south and go along the walkway to nab a Potion.  When you try to
escape, a blue monster appears attacks your party.

His Sewer Tsunami attack hurts all members, so use Potions and the
Restore Materia to heal your wounds.  Luckily, the Tsunami will damage
him, too (he uses this attack as a counterattack before dying if he can
manage it).  When he does the reverse Sewer Tsunami, it causes less
damage to him.  Fire spells work the best on him.  Use Cloud's Limit
Break to harm the boss and use Aeris' Limit Break to heal yourselves.
You'll receive a Phoenix Down for winning the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

Climb up the ladder and head right.  Go down into the sewage, then up the
stairs.  Grab the Yellow Materia (Steal) and go down the hatch.  In the
next room, go down the stairs, then climb up the side of the curved
structure.  Climb up the ladder and you'll go outside.  There's a Save
Point here.  Check out the oil drum nearby by entering the train car
(near the Save Point) to get a Hi-Potion.  Get another Hi-Potion on the
roof of adjacent car, then hop off onto the iron beam and check the oil
drum to the north for an Echo Screen.  Walk east, then south and enter
the nearby train car to get a Potion.  Climb up the ladder, head north,
and climb down again.  Go north once more through the train car, then
exit to your left to find a second Potion.  Then, go north to arrive at
the next screen.

Here, circle left around the car to get a Potion.  Circle left again to
find an oil can with an Ether inside of it.  Go north and enter the
train to the right to move the other train car out of the way.  Climb
atop the formerly blocked car to net a Hi-Potion.  Now, ride the other
train back backwards, climb onto the eastern train car, jump onto the
train you just moved, and climb across it and the last car before going
down the ladder to get back to the front part of the Train Graveyard.

Head left.  The Avalanche members will be fighting atop the support
pillar you first saw when you arrived at the base.  After Wedge plummets
to the ground, save your game at the Save Point and talk to the man on
the left if you need to buy items.  Climb up the stairs and you'll meet
Barret, who is firing at the Shinra helicopter you saw back at the
plant.  Reno will jump out, and you'll have to fight him.  Good thing
Barret joins you.  When you inflict enough damage, the boss runs away!

This guy packs a wallop.  He can imprison your friends using his golden
Pyramid attack, and if he does this to all your members, you lose.  To
break the pyramids, attack your allies (they won't be damaged).  Watch
for his spark bolt attack (which can paralyze you) and use your Limit
Breaks whenever possible.  Ice works well on him.  For some players,
this may be the first battle they lose!  You'll get an Ether for scaring
him off should you win.

  3.8  into the sky
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Sense materia, Battery x3, Ether.

After fending off the boss, Tseng will kidnap Aeris (and p**p slap her)!
As he escapes, the entire city explodes and falls down a level,
destroying it.  Cloud, Tifa, and Barret all come to in the playground at
the Sector 6 Slums.  After Barret yells for Marlene, Wedge, and his other
friends, he and Tifa join you in the next area when you try to leave.  Go
back to get a sparkling yellow Materia (Sense), before returning to Wall
Market.  The man in the pottery store will now sell you Materia, and if
you go back to the parlor, you have the option of freeing one of Don
Corneo's men from the torture chamber.  Even if you got the Member's Card
the first time around, you can no longer enter the brothel, by the way.

When you're done, leave and go south from the playground.  Return to the
Sector 5 Slum and go to Aeris's house.  Talk to Elmyra, her mother.  You
can spend the night in the upstairs bedroom once the intermission ends.
Return to the Wall Market and go to the dead-end area near the parlor.
(you'll see a bunch of kids run in there).  Climb up the pipe, and you'll
find yourself high above the town.  If you haven't gotten them already,
go to the 'Machine & Gun' store and talk to the man at the left end of
the store; he'll sell you 3 Battery for 300 gil.  You'll need them
to activate the boxes in this part of the game.  With that in mind,
examine the box-shaped object in the lower right to try and start a
nearby propeller.  Head up, and you'll jump onto the propeller.  From
there, make your way to the other box and activate the painted barrier.
Climb up it, and use the O button to jump onto the swinging metal pipe.
Despite what Cloud says, jump when it is close to you (just as it stops
squeaking).  After that, climb up to the next screen.

Here, climb up, then drop down to activate the next box and you'll find
an Ether.  Climb down the lefthand pipe and make your way back up again.
Instead of dropping down, continue up, and you'll find yourself at
Shinra's headquarters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.9  shinra headquarters building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Elixir, Elemental materia, Star Pendant, Four Slots,
                     All materia, Phoenix Down, Ether, Poison materia,
                     Grenade x1~3, Talisman, Enemy Skill materia,
                     Potion x4, Mythril Armlet, Protect Vest, Guard
                     Source.

There's a Save Point here.  You have the option of either heading to the
left and climbing up a stairwell (sneaking in) or barging in through the
front door ('kick some Shinra butt!', as Barret would say).

Going up the stairs takes forever, but it's free of enemies and you can
get an Elixir that's lying on one of the landings.  On the other hand,
going through the front door and taking the elevators in the back is
faster, but you have to fight several battles along the way.  Not only
that, but you can chase around the Shinra staff before taking the
elevator :)  (or at least, you could in the Japanese version.  They
all ran away....)  You can't use the circular lifts by the doors yet, but
you can use them once you reach the 60th floor.  If you go up the stairs,
you'll see a door marked 'Accessories'.  Inside the room, you can look
at a monitor to see a short FMV sequence about Shinra's products (this
is the 2nd most overlooked FMV in the game).  There are two chests here,
but the lady won't let you open them.  She will sell you items, though.
Remember, if you go through the front, check the control panel in the
elevator (the one that goes haywire) after each enemy encounter in order
to continue upwards.  If you go up the stairs then change your mind and
go back down, you won't have to fight anybody on the elevators, and the
main area of the ground floor will be empty (an easy trick for not
having to fight anyone :)).  I advise that no matter which method you
use, be sure to get the Elixir on the staircase.

No matter what method you use, you'll eventually reach the 59th floor.
Head southeast and kill the armored guards to get the Keycard 60, then
take the lift to the 60th floor.  Here, you'll have to head to the room
in the upper-left and make it to the other side without being seen by
the patrolling guards.  In order to stay hidden from them, pause behind
the gold statues, then lead Tifa and Barret across using the O button.
If you mess up, not only to you get attacked (ambush-style combat), but
you'll have to start all over again.  However, after a while (if you
mess up enough times), the guards won't reappear and you can just run to
the end of the hallway.  Keep in mind that the set of guards on the right
half of the screen move faster than the ones on the left.

Take the stairway up to the 61st floor.  Talk to everyone here.  A man
who asks you about Aeris will give you the Keycard 62 if you answer
"......".  On floor 62, talk to the man in the room, Domino, and the man
in white, (Hart) then check out the two library rooms.  Answer Domino's
question and he'll give you the Keycard 65.  The problem with this is
that the answer changes with each game you play.  It seems like it would
be easy enough to simply try each answer until you get it right, but you
get an Elemental Materia for free if you answer correctly the first time.
So, it's in your best interest to just reset and keep trying in order to
get the materia.  Hart will help you out if you need it, but he'll want
you to pay him first.  To get the answer, simply look for the misplaced
file, and note the number of the file.  Count forward that many letters,
and write down that letter.  After getting all four letters in this way,
try to rearrange them into one of the words that Domino suggests is an
answer.  He gives you varying items depending on how many tries it takes
you (you'll get lesser items if you mess up each time).

The 63rd floor is tricky.  You have to collect 3 Coupons from all three
rooms, but you're only able to open 3 doors at a time.  You can reset
the doors by investigating the computer in the right-hand room, but that
also resets the location of the Coupons.  You can move around using
walkways in the ducts; to enter them you have to climb into the black,
box-shaped structures (there's one in the computer room).  You can't do
that unless you have at least one of the three items.

To get the items, follow this procedure: activate the computer, then
head to the top-right corner of the screen and open the gate farthest to
the right.  Head left and open the left-hand gate, then walk left and go
south to enter the room where A Coupon is.  Choose the top option to
climb into the black box and use the walkway to get to the room where B
Coupon is.  Finally, go through the door in this room and open the door
to the left, then go north to enter the room containing C Coupon.  Then
use the walkway to return to the computer room.

Now if you want, you can just trade one of the Coupons for an item,
but if you have all three then you'll get all three items.  The trade
setup works like this (choose 'Coupon Change'):

 - Trade Coupon A for the Star Pendant accessory
 - Trade Coupon B for the Four Slots bracelet
 - Trade Coupon C for the All materia

To get your items (depending on how many coupons you have) go to the
computer and choose the bottom option,  then the top.  Keep in mind
that you can only do this once.

On the 64th floor, you'll find a Save Point and bedroom to your left.
You can use the machines in the exercise room, or spend 250 gil trying
to get a health drink.  Yeah, perhaps it seems stupid to waste your
gil when you don't get anything now, but if you come back later....
If you examine the lockers in the back room, you can find a Phoenix
Down, an Ether, and a M-phone (HP Shout), but you can only take the
first two items for now.  Head to the 65th floor.

Here, you have to open a treasure chest, then examine a broken section
of the model in the circular room and choose the top option to repair
it.  This unlocks one of the other chests, allowing you to open it and
use the part inside to repair another section of the model.  When you
have finished, you'll get the Keycard 66 from the final chest.  You
must fix the model in a counter-clockwise fashion starting from the
bottom.  The order of the chests you open goes like this:

 - Upper-left room:   bottom chest
 - Upper-left room:   top chest
 - Lower-left room:   left chest
 - Lower-left room:   top chest
 - Upper-right room:  chest
 - Middle-right room: get the Keycard 66 from here when you're done.

On the 66th floor, you can either run into the meeting hall as quickly
as you can (if you took the elevator...it's a glitch, and was possible
in the Japanese version, at least :)), or you can enter the stall in the
bathroom located in the northwest corner of the floor.  Choose the
middle option, and you'll climb on top of the toilet and enter an air
duct.  Move forward to see what the Shinra members (Reeve, Palmer,
President Shinra, Heidegger, Hojo, and Scarlet) are discussing.

Climb back out, then climb up the stairwell after Hojo (the pony-tailed
scientist) in the room to the right of the meeting hall.  Note that
you'll end up in the air duct even if you ran into the hall...heh, heh.
On the next floor (67), talk to the people and keep following the
scientist.  After looking in the purple chamber (and after Cloud gets
another headache), move beyond the crates and to the right to find a
Save Point and a treasure chest with a Poison Materia inside.

Enter the elevator to the north, and then watch as the scientist toys
with Aeris.  Now, choose who you want to protect Aeris, (either
Barret or Tifa), and then you can name the lion-like creature (Red 13)
that was attacking Hojo.  He'll fight alongside you when the mutant
boss shows up.  Don't forget that Red 13 comes equipped with his own
Materia!

           Sample:HO512-OPT                     LV:  7  HP:  300  MP:  48

Don't try to kill this guy's little guardians; he'll only create more.
Instead, use Bolt or Fire on him and try Restore to keep up your own
life power.  Avoid using physical attacks, Ice, or Poison.  This means
that Red 13 is better off using Fire against the boss than attacking.
This battle is easier if you have Barret, who can inflict more damage.
Don't worry about getting poisoned since you can get infected again when
the boss uses the pink gas attack on your characters (there's no point in
trying to de-poison yourselves).  You'll get a Talisman should you kill
the boss, and Grenades depending on the OPTs that you killed.
_________________________________________________________________________

Tifa or Barret return after the battle (depending on who you chose).
You'll be asked to make a new party (but you can keep the old one you had
before, if you wish).  When you're in control of Cloud again, be sure to
grab the yellow materia (Enemy Skill) that's left behind in the sample
chamber.  Then go up the ladder and head south.  Talk to the man in the
gray coat to get the Keycard 68.  Go back down to floor 66 and try
entering one of the lifts; you'll get caught by Rude (he's a Turk who
you'll be running into constantly throughout the game).  He and Tseng
will 'escort' you to a meeting with the president of Shinra.  Afterwards,
you'll end up in the jail cells on floor 67.  Here, listen to everyone,
then go to sleep.

The next morning, you'll find that your door is unlocked.  Investigate
the guard, then talk to Tifa.  Check the guard again to unlock the doors,
then look in on Barret and Red 13.  After freeing your companions, return
to the lab and talk to Red 13.  Talk to him again after taking the
elevator up to the 68th floor, then use the incline to reach the walkway
again.  Go all the way along it until you find two purple Potions, then
climb back down and enter the door from the ground floor.  The green bars
of light won't hurt you; run through them and pick up two more Potions
before climbing up the stairs to the 69th floor.

Go out the center door to reach a Save Point.  Then, run up either of
the purple stairs.  Check out the dead Shinra president, capture Palmer,
then go through the door to the north to exit the room.  Outside, talk
to the man in white.  He's Rufus, son of the Shinra president.

The other characters will return to the floor below, and you must lead
them outside (you can also choose to unequip Aeris' and Cloud's materia
in case you want to juggle them around for the upcoming battles).  Your
team now consists of Red 13, Barret, and Aeris; don't forget to reequip
your Materia (it seems as if the top option removes it....)  Head to the
lift (by taking the lower door).  When you activate it, you are attacked
by a huge gun-wielding machine while going down the side of the Shinra
building.

                                                   weak against Lightning

You can only use long-range attacks, so use Barret's attacks and his
Limit Break as well as magic to harm this foe.  Poison-based magic
inflicts no damage, while Bolt does the most damage.  Red 13 is a
sitting duck if he doesn't have any spell Materia equipped, so be sure
to deck him out with some magic spells (he can still use his Limit
Break).  When you inflict enough damage, the boss starts to break down.
After the second collapse, he starts firing heat blasts that damage all
members, so be careful.
_________________________________________________________________________

After killing the boss, you must fight a flying machine.

                                                   weak against Lightning

As with the other boss, don't use Bio but do use Bolt.  You may be weak
after the last battle, so make use of Potions, the Restore Materia, and
Aeris' B1/1 Break (Healing Wind) to restore lost life.  You'll win a
Mythril Armlet when the boss dies.
_________________________________________________________________________

The scene switches back to Cloud.  Heal yourself if necessary, equip
Materia, then press Start.  Rufus will then attack you.  Feel free to
adjust his equipment/Materia if need be before the battle.

Kill the panther guardian first, then go after the boss.  Although you
can't do anything about the panther casting Barrier on Rufus, you can
use magic instead to inflict damage.  He can only hurt you with his
shotgun, so don't worry about healing yourself after each round (just
heal yourself when your life gets lower).  Sock him with your Limit
Breaks and he'll escape onto the circling helicopter after you've
damaged him enough.  Cloud will get a Protect Vest and a Guard Source
when the battle ends.
_________________________________________________________________________

Leave the rooftop and head back to where Tifa is waiting for you.  As
Aeris, try to approach the front doors.  After a short conversation,
you and the gang will escape by motorcycle (and truck).  Your team is
now made up of Cloud, Tifa, and Barret.

An option screen appears where you have the following options:

S       Left Attack
X       Switch members
O       Right Attack
T       Main Menu
Start   Return to game

Be sure to re-equip Materia before returning to the game!

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Star Pendant.

Use the controller to move any any direction.  Pressing S makes you slash
to the left, and pressing O makes you slash to the right.  The object
here is to protect your friends in the truck from enemy cyclists.
Eventually, you'll reach a dead end and fight the boss.  The amount of
life you start off with during the battle depends on how much life you
and your friends lost during the high-speed escape.  If a character lost
all his life, he begins with only 1 point when the battle starts, but
since the boss gets to make the first attack, they'll have to be revived
using Phoenix Downs if there are any party members who survived.  The
boss is a spiked, armored robot with six wheels.

BOSS TIPS: MOTOR BALL                               LV: 19  2600  MP: 120
                                                   weak against Lightning

This boss gets a free attack from behind...sheesh.  Most of his attacks
do little damage, but his Firethrower and flying fire sweep attacks
can kill your party in a single blast (the fire sweep does around 220
damage)!  The best way to beat this group is have your party consist of
Aeris and Barret.  Give the All and Restore materia to either Cloud or
Barret, and give the other character Lightning.  This way, you can heal
with one character, attack with another, and then use Aeris' Limit Break
to keep your life up at all times.  Ice works better than Fire against
the boss (for those characters that don't have Lightning equipped).
Remember, your rows are reversed when attacked from behind, so put Cloud
and Barret in the back and Aeris in the front if you want them to line
up properly when the boss shows up (assuming that's who you use...I found
that they worked the best).  If you beat the boss, you'll get a Star
Pendant.

  3.11  kalm town / chocobo farm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether x3, Peacemaker, Guard Source, Choco/Mog
                     materia, Megalixir

You'll find yourselves outside of the gate after beating the boss (you
could also see this scene by going south from the church where you met
Aeris the first time).  Decide who will be in your group, then head
towards the screen to exit and arrive at the World Map (the outside
world).

Kalm Town isn't far from Midgar; you should be able to see it if you
walk north a ways.  Go into the inn to see the rest of the gang waiting
for you.  Cloud will talk to the others about Sephiroth via a series of
semi-interactive flashbacks:

- You'll start off in a truck being driven by Shinra soldiers.  After
  talking to the soldiers and Sephiroth (Cloud's former ally in the
  Shinra army and now a wanted criminal), the truck will be stopped
  by a dragon.  You'll have to fight it, but Sephiroth (who is super-
  powerful) can kill it in two hits.  In the flashback, Cloud's
  portrait is different; this 'Young Cloud' is of a low level, but
  Sephiroth is so strong that you need not worry about losing battles.
  However, you can't control Sephiroth's actions and you can't hurt
  him (because of your low level), either.  Although Young Cloud comes
  equipped with an Pre-emptive materia and Sephiroth has several
  mastered materia equipped, you can't take them for your own (although
  you can if you use a Game Shark code...see section 14).  Also, Young
  Cloud and Sephiroth can't use Limit Breaks (because they don't have
  any).

- After the battle, you'll end up in Nibelheim, Cloud's hometown.
  Talk to Sephiroth and the guards if you wish, then head north.
  If you want to look around the town, feel free to, but nothing
  you do during this part of the game has an affect on the rest of
  your quest (although is does affect the character's questions
  and reactions to Cloud's story).  One thing you might want to do
  is go into Tifa's house (the large building on the 'southeastern'
  side of town).  You can read her stuff, play the piano (if you
  play the 'Highwind' theme, Cloud will act like he remembers it
  from somewhere), or even search her closet (hey, they changed
  'slightly-stretched underwear' to 'orthopedic underwear'.  What's
  the big deal? :))  Also note that you can't get Vincent Valentine
  during Cloud's flashback because you can't examine the safe :(

- When you're done looking around town, go to the inn and head
  upstairs.  Talk to Sephiroth and choose to get some sleep.
  The next day, talk to Sephiroth and get your picture taken, then
  sit back and watch the FMV.  When you're in control of Cloud,
  head along the bridge and talk to Tifa, then talk to her again
  further along the bridge and it will break.  After you've
  recovered, head northeast into the cave, then keep heading north.
  Eventually, you'll arrive at the Jenova plant.  Enter it, head
  along the beams, then walk onto the wood platform and climb down
  the chains and go after Sephiroth.  Talk to him in the next area,
  examine the chamber to the left of Sephiroth, then talk to him
  twice, once to make him move out of the way and once to make Cloud
  look inside the chamber.  After Sephiroth goes ballistic, you'll
  return to Kalm Town.  Pick the top option to save your game, or
  the bottom option to continue.  Cloud's narrative starts off back
  at Nibelheim, where he enters the large mansion at the edge of
  town.

- Inside, climb the two staircases and head to the right.  Enter the
  lower door and make your way into the next room; if you examine
  the circular part of the stone wall, a passage appears.  Enter it
  and climb down the spiraling walkway until you reach the bottom;
  keep walking from here to find a library.  Leave after Sephiroth
  finishes talking.  After Cloud wakes up, return to the library.
  Sephiroth gives a little speech then he exits the mansion; return
  to the town square.  Try entering the house to your right.

- Back at the Jenova plant, return to the area with the chambers after
  witnessing the struggle between Tifa and Sephiroth.  Examine Tifa to
  carry her out of harm's way, then run up the stairs and enter the
  door that Sephiroth opened.  After the FMV sequence, Cloud's
  flashback ends and you are returned to Kalm Town.

On the second floor of the inn is a cabinet with an item in it that
you can't reach.  However if you keep trying to get it, Cloud will
eventually knock the item down, which turns out to be a Megalixir.
That's right, you can get a Megalixir at this early point in the
game, so don't miss it! :)

Note that you have to go to Kalm Town to proceed with the game; you
can't make your way through the Mythril Mines beforehand, although you
can visit the Chocobo Farm if you want to.  As for treasure, there's an
Ether in the door beneath the stairs in the house near the inn, another
Ether in the cabinet on the second floor of the house to the right of
that house, and a Peacemaker in the chest on the second floor of the
third house (take the curving stairs).  You can also look out of the
window here (a neat little trick).  If you take the normal stairs in
the same house, you can get a Guard Source in the cabinet by the little
girl.  Finally, in the house on the other side of the town, there is an
Ether in the door beneath the stairs on the north wall of the first
floor.  Oh, you'll be given the PHS (Party Hensei System) when you talk
to your allies on the first floor of the inn; it allows you to switch
group members whenever you want, providing that you're in the World Map
or standing on a Save Point (there are a few exceptions to this rule).

Note that in the house to the right of the inn, there's a chest you
can't open on the upper floor.  If anyone knows how to unlock it, I'd
love to hear from you.

Leave the town and head east to reach the Chocobo Farm.  Talk to the
Chocobo at the front end of the pen and choose the top option to see
the big yellow birds dance; you'll get the Choco/Mog materia afterwards.
Then, talk to Choco Billy (the man with the hat) in the stables behind
the pen.  Choose the first option, then the 4th option, then the top
option again.  Providing you have 2000 gil to spare, he'll sell you a
Chocobo Lure materia, which lets you attract chocobos to ride.

To catch a chocobo, wander around outside on the chocobo tracks (in
this area of the game, you can meet them on the light patches of
grass, too), until you are attacked.  If a chocobo is one of your
opponents, then kill off the other enemies and when the battle ends,
you'll be riding the chocobo.  If you attack the chocobo, it will
hurt you and the other enemies, then escape, so you'll have to try
again.  Don't forget, you can only fight chocobos if you have the
Chocobo Lure materia equipped.  When riding a chocobo, your can move
around normally, and you won't get attacked by enemies.  You can press
X to dismount, but if you do this, the Chocobo will run away and you'll
have to catch another one.

A little to the south and directly west of the Chocobo farm is a cave,
but a creeping snake in the marsh before the cave entrance will rise up
to attack you.  Instead of trying to kill it now, go get a Chocobo
instead, who can outrun the snake and enter the cave.  Yes, you will
still get attacked if the snake touches your chocobo.

Note that you can run across the marsh on foot, but nothing special
happens if you do so (and it's nigh-impossible to pull off without
running into Midgar Zolom).

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: MIDGAR ZOLOM                         LV: 26  HP: 4000  MP: 348

This boss has two deadly attacks: one is a tail swipe that knocks a team
member off-screen and puts them out of commission for the rest of the
battle.  The other one is the Beta enemy skill, which inflicts around
1000-1200 points of damage (which spells instant defeat if your allies
are weak, although you should try to pick up this skill if you have a
Enemy Skill materia equipped).  Along with his bite attack, this serpent
can be a tough enemy if you try to fight him earlier in the game.  It's
easier if you try to defeat him after you have Cid's airplane, since you
can use Limit Breaks and powerful summon and magic spells to kill it.
Unfortunately, you get a measly amount of EXP, AP, and gil for beating
the boss and what's worse, he reappears when you return to the World
Map, so you're right back where you started.
_________________________________________________________________________

Note that if Midgar Zolom knocks one of your allies off-screen, the
game won't end should the other members be killed; instead, you'll find
yourself standing at the edge of the marsh.

The first time you get across the marsh, you'll see a large snake
impaled on a tree.  Just exit the screen to continue playing.  Also, if
you get off your chocobo while on the patch of grass before the mine
entrance, he'll stay there in case you need to return to the farm (this
doesn't seem to happen all the time--I don't know why).  If you're
strong enough, you can get to the Mythril Mines without ever having to
go to the Chocobo Farm.

  3.12  mithril mine / junon town
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Tent, Long Range materia, Mind Source x2,
                     Elixir, Power Wrist, Shiva materia, Grenade or
                     Potion x6 or Ether x6, Enemy Skill materia, 1/35
                     soldier x2, Luck Source, Power Source, Guard Source,
                     Speed Plus Source, Silver Glasses or HP Plus or
                     Force Stealer.

Inside the Mythril Mine, head northeast to find a green Ether on the
stone steps.  In the chest is a Tent, so be sure to grab it.  If you try
climbing up the brown vine on the western rock face, you'll find a purple
materia (Long Range).  Climb back down, return to the first area, then
head left.  Make your way southeast to find a chest with a Mind Source
inside, then head west to reach the next area.

Here, you'll run into some of the Turks again: Rude, Elena, and Tseng.
Once they leave, walk north.  There's a chest with a Elixir inside it
and a Hi-Potion just to the north of the chest.  Return to the area
where you met the Turks, climb up the vine, and go through the door to
exit the mine and return to the World Map.  From now on, you can meet
Yuffie in the forests and have her join you (refer to section 8 for
details).

Nearby is a rocky outcropping with a huge bird statue atop it, the Condor
Fort.  Enter it and choose the second option when talking to the man out
front.  After climbing up the rope, you'll find yourself in a town built
into the rock itself.  There is a Save Point, item shop, bedroom (you can
sleep for free), and Materia shop here.  Talk to everyone.  There's also
a mini-battle you can fight here.  When you're done, leave and go
northwest through the forest to Junon Town by the shore.  For
information on fighting the battles in the mini-game, refer to section
7.6 (Having Fun).

Once you arrive at Junon, talk to the villagers, then go down the stairs
to the shore.  Here, a young girl named Priscilla is playing with a
dolphin.  Out of nowhere, a big flying boss shows up and attacks her,
then your party.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: BOTTOMSWELL                          LV: 23  HP: 2500  MP: 100
                                                weak against Wind
           WATERPOLO                            LV: 5   HP: 40    MP: 0

There's not much to worry about; just attack with Lightning or Poison-
based spells and keep your life up.  Since this guy's flying, some
characters can't attack him (like Tifa), while some can (Barret).  Find
out which guys should be casting magic and which should be attacking
early on in the battle.  On the other hand, if you have a Long Range
Attack materia handy, equip it, since that will let you attack the boss.
Sometimes, the boss puts an HP-reducing bubble around a character.  It
only disappears if you cast a magic spell upon it (this won't hurt the
'bubbled' person).  If you have the Affect All materia, you can use this
to cast a spell on the bubbled person and the boss at the same time.
Before dying, the boss will attack with Big Wave, (he can do this
normally, but always does one before he disappears) so watch out and make
sure your HP is high enough to withstand an attack.  You'll receive a
Power Wrist when the battle is over.
_________________________________________________________________________

After killing the boss, you'll have to revive Priscilla.  To do this,
watch the lung-shaped meter that appears in the upper right.  Press
the S button once to make the meter start to raise.  Just as it reaches
the top, press S again to make Cloud breathe into the girl's mouth.
It will take a couple of tries, but don't sweat it; she can't die.
Afterwards, go to the house near the entrance to town and talk to the old
lady standing there.  Decide to stay the night.

That evening, Cloud will have another bad dream.  In the morning, leave
and go to the house above the stairs (your friends will have gathered
near it).  Priscilla will give you the Shiva materia, a gift for saving
her life.  Follow her to the shore, then talk to her a second time.
Barret will show up and the girl will keep talking; when you have the
chance, choose the middle option.  Your goal in this part of the game is
to leap atop the iron beam above the electrical tower so that you can
sneak into the heart of Junon Town.  Your controls are:

X        Swim faster
S        Makes the dolphin flip you into the air

If you get to close to the electric blasts traveling along the tower,
you'll get shocked and will have to try again (just pick the second
option).  The easiest way to get up there is to simply not move and
press S.  The dolphin will miss and deposit you near the bottom of
the screen.  However, you'll be perfectly positioned, so if you press
S again, Cloud will land on the beam.  Once you're on it, head to the
left to get a good view of the flying airship 'Highwind'.  Make your
way south (towards the 'front' of the screen) to continue once you've
climbed up the ladder.

The next area has a higher and lower level.  If you investigate the box-
like switch, you'll be taken to the lower level.  From there, head south
to find a building.  Can't find it?  Well, there is a projecting roof
nearby which has a door underneath it; just press against the edge and
you'll enter a hallway filled with soldiers.  In the halls, go up to
find a locker room.  Check out the half-open locker and choose to dress
up as a guard.  When the other soldiers enter and start singing, talk
to the captain again and tell him you understand (or tell him no if you
want to watch a little more), when you're ready to leave.

Outside, take note of the Save Point before going through the lower exit.
After the FMV sequence, follow the guards into the first alleyway.
You'll come across a group of marching soldiers.  The head guard will
want you to join in and march with them perfectly, but it may take a
couple of attempts before this event will end if you mess up badly.  You
also have to move your gun in time with the soldiers by pressing and
releasing the O button.  Depending on how high or low the TV counter was
during this scene (the one in the lower right-hand corner),
you will get the following:

   PERCENT      NAME        TYPE
   1%  - 21% =  Grenade     Item
   22% - 39% =  Potion x6   Item
   39% - 50% =  Ether x6    Item
   51% - 99% =  5000 gil    Currency

(note that this chart isn't 100% exact...feel free to send corrections!)

Afterwards, you'll have to stand at attention while Rufus and Heidegger
talk to each other...press in any direction and the captain of the guard
will tell you to get back in line.  After the rest of the soldiers leave,
the captain will give you an option; choose either option and you'll
return to the locker room for some training on the next event.  There,
you can try to follow the captain's orders, if you wish.  When he asks
you a question, choose the top choice to try training again, or the
bottom option to finish the training.  Once the soldiers leave, follow
them outside.

Now's your chance to do a little shopping and treasure hunting.  You'll
run into Rude in the basement of the first weapon shop, but he won't
recognize you in your Shinra guard uniform.  Go through the third door
and talk to the guard near the back of the room, then jump down to an
area with several Shinra guards and some holograms.  In the far corner
of the room is a yellow materia (Enemy Skill).  This place is similar to
the 'House of Learning' back in Midgar where you could learn about the
game's mechanics.   On the second floor of the same building, you can
get a 1/35 soldier and a Mind Source.  In the room with the cats nearby
is a Luck Source.  On the third floor is a red Power Source and a green
Guard Source.

If you enter the fourth door (the first door on the other side of town),
you'll find that that Elena, Rudo, and Tseng of the Turks are here.
It's a good thing that you're in that uniform :)  Go through the sixth
door to find a room with a soldier; you can check the silver trashbin
or the opposite chair to get a message from the guard (yes, this is a
glitch) and pick up a yellow Speed Source in the side room.  On the
floor above, you can pick up another 1/35 soldier.

In the next area, Heidegger and Rufus show up again.  You have to do
your salute according to what the captain of the guard tells you to do
(remember your training)!  At the very end, all you have to do is be
facing forward: pressing any button will make you do the 'spinning gun'
salute.  Unfortunately, the order of commands is random each time you
play, so just do your best.  Afterwards, you can press the following
buttons to make Cloud do funny things:

S       Scratch back with gun
X       Put one leg forward
T       Shrug
Pad     Stand at attention

Depending on how well you did during the salute, Heidegger will give you
an item.  Each 'button press' action was worth 10 points, and the final
salute was worth 30 points.  Changing direction was worth 0 points, but
unless you were facing in the correct direction, any action you performed
was worth 0 points.  Also, performing an action was worth 0 points if you
did it too late (although you'll get full points if you do the action
early).  Your total score determines what you will receive (notice that
Rufus' reactions change depending on what item you will be given):

   SCORE        NAME              TYPE
   000 - 050 =  Silver Glasses    Accessory
   060 - 090 =  HP Plus           Independent Materia
   100 - 200 =  Force Stealer     Weapon (for Cloud)

After everyone else leaves, Red 13 (who was watching from just inside the
boat) will talk to you if you try to leave instead of boarding the boat.
Either way, you'll end up joining your friends in the boat's hull.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.13  shinra cargo ship
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Ether, All materia, Wind Slash, White Cape.

Open the treasure chest to get an Ether, and be sure to pick up the blue
materia (All).  If Yuffie's in your party, she'll be blocking the way to
the materia, but you can always get it later.  Speaking of, if you're
trying to befriend Yuffie for the 'date' sequence later, make sure you
have a Tranquilizer to give her.  Talk to the people here, then go up on
the deck and talk to everyone else; you'll notice that some of them are
your companions (don't miss Red 13 :)).  The man in white will sell you
items if you talk to him, or 'Invisible Alpha', a instant-use drink that
restores your HP and MP.  Once you're done talking to your pals, go back
down and talk to Aeris, then return to the deck and go all the way to
the left; one of the guards has left, allowing you to sneak to the front
of the ship.

Here, talk to Barret, who is spying on the Shinra members.  After talking
to him a couple of times, an alarm will sound.  Go back to the center of
the boat to find your friends.  Then, assemble your party.  If you want
to change the setup, talk to your friends again.  When you're ready, go
downstairs and head through the door that the one guard was standing in
front of.  In the next room, watch out for enemies and climb up the
ladder, the walkway leads to a chest with a Wind Slash inside.  Did you
get all the items on the boat?  When you're ready, go and talk to the
captain of the guards.  It turns out that he's dead.  Then, Sephiroth
shows up, and summons a huge monster for you to fight before he flies
away.

BOSS TIPS: JENOVA*BIRTH                         LV: 25  HP: 4000  MP: 110

Earth, Fire, and Cold magic work well against it, but don't use Poison.
Attack with your Summon Materia and hit it with everything you've got.
Keeping your HP up is a priority, since it can use lasers to attack one
or all members.  Only use physical attacks if you are running low on MP.
The boss can cast 'Stop' on a single ally so make sure that you're not
too dependent on any one character during the battle.  Some Phoenix
Tails will also come in handy, since the boss sometimes uses a laser
that hits all allies (Terror Laser) twice in a row (which can inflict
loads of damage).  You'll get a White Cape when the battle is over.
_________________________________________________________________________


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.14  costa del sol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ifrit materia, Power Source x2, Motor Drive, Fire
                     Ring, W Machinegun, Turbo Ether, Transform materia,
                     Wizard Staff, Star Pendant, Soft x2, Phoenix Down
                     x10, Mind Source, Tent.

Grab the red Materia (Summon Ifrit) after the battle and wait for the
boat to dock.  Talk to the people here and then go up the stairs.  A
short automatic sequence follows.  In the next area, go into the door
to meet a shady guy who will sell you this room for 300,000 gil; you can
sleep here for free anytime you want afterwards.  Climb down the stairs
in the bottom part of the room to reach a basement with a sleeping
man.  You can get a Power Source and a Motor Drive here, as well as a
Fire Ring from the treasure chest.  You'll meet Mukki (from the cabaret
in the Wall Market) in the bar, as well as some of his friends.  If you
go down to the beach, you'll run into Hojo (the scientist you met in the
Shinra HQ).  You can talk to him if you want, but you won't get anything
out of it.  Note that if you stayed at an inn here before going to the
beach, Hojo will be gone, however, you can stay at the villa, if you
bought it, and he will still be there.  After talking to him, any party
members who aren't in your group will disperse around town.

Outside of the town, head through the mountains and across the bridge.
You'll find a cave-like entrance.  Talk to the man on the hill, then
keep heading north.  Eventually, you'll reach a walkway that leads to
a large Makoro furnace.  Head south and follow the train tracks; there's
no point in looking around here.  Keep going, and you'll come across
some curving tracks and a Save Point.  As you walk along the tracks, you
can get the following items:  W Machinegun, Turbo Ether, and a Transform
materia.

These tracks are rickety, and when you walk across them in certain areas
a message will appear telling you to press O so that you don't fall
through them.  It's better to let yourself fall, because you can then
hold left or right and rapidly press O to land beneath the tracks.  Then,
press Up to climb back up.  If you landed on the left side of the tracks,
you can pick up a Wizard Staff.  If you landed in the middle, you can't
get anything, but if you landed on the right side, you'll find a Star
Pendant.  There are three places where you can fall through the tracks,
so be sure to get these items.

Take the upper rail path to the next area.  Are your friends waiting for
you on the lower track?  If they're not, then go back and take the lower
path.  You'll get an option to summon them using the PHS system.
Assuming they're there, take the upper path and keep walking until you
find a wooden shed.  Enter it and pick the top choice when you're
prompted to make a decision.  This will lower the tracks on the bottom
path.  Before returning to the lower rail path and following after your
allies, you can walk to the end of the path you're on and climb the wall;
you'll hear birds chirping if you're in the right place.

After finding the nest, you can choose to take the treasure in the nest
(the top option), or leave the birds alone (the bottom option).  If you
choose the top option, you're attacked.

TIPS: COCATRICE                                    LV: 17  HP: 420  MP: 0

This guy's easy; just attack until it dies.  You'll get 10 Phoenix Downs
should you kill it.  You can get two Softs from it; one by stealing, the
other by killing it with Morph (assuming you're using a GameShark code.)
_________________________________________________________________________

You'll get 10 Phoenix Downs after the battle is over.  Cloud will then
return to the train tracks.  Keep in mind that this is a one-shot deal;
whether you decide to take the treasure or not, you can only make a
choice one time.  As you're traveling along the lower rail path, you'll
see a part where the track splits in two directions.  Take the left path
(the one that turns back).  Walk north (towards the bridge), then right
(under the first bridge).  It may sound confusing, but you'll end up in
a little shack where there's a bunch of items and a man resting on a
bulldozer.  There's a Mind Source and a Power Source here, and the chest
has a Tent inside of it.  Leave and follow the other path across the
bridge in the next area to reach the town of North Corel.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.15  gold saucer / corel prison
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Silver Armlet, Ramuh materia.

There's some merchants here at North Corel and an inn.  You can also
learn more about Barret here, whether he's in your party or not.  When
you're done shopping and chatting, go to the ropeway.  After Barret has
a flashback about his friend Dain, take the lift up to the Gold Saucer.
You can return to the World Map by heading right from the bottom area of
the town, but there's nothing to do out there (aside from saving your
game or riding around on a Chocobo).

You'll see a Save Point in the background of the first area of the Gold
Saucer, but you'll need GP (not gil, like what you've been using) to
activate it.  Pay the man to get in (the first choice is for a one-visit
entry free, the second choice gets you a 'Gold Ticket', which lets you
enter the Gold Saucer as often as you'd like), and then choose the path
of your choice after your companions separate.  You can take a pal with
you by talking to them.

If you try to leave the Station Square (the area where you're at; all
the areas in the Saucer are divided into 'squares'), Aeris will join
you.  As you explore the rest of the Gold Saucer, you'll discover that
Shinra soldiers are snooping around, looking for Sephiroth.  When
you're ready to move on, go to the Wonder Square.  Here, you'll meet
Cait Sith, a would-be fortuneteller.  He'll automatically join you since
you only have two members (you and your friend) at this point.

Go to the Battle Square and you'll find a bunch of dead bodies; the
handiwork of 'a man with a gun on for an arm'.  As you're talking to the
one person who is still alive, Dio, the proprietor of the Gold Saucer,
shows up and promptly blames you for the carnage.  Cait Sith makes a dash
for freedom, but after following him, the party is trapped.  Dio and his
henchmen then summon three large robots that throw you and your allies
through the 'Gateway to Heaven' to a desolate area, the Corel Prison,
which lies at the base of the Gold Saucer.

Here, you'll find Barret.  After he runs away, examine the dead body
and talk to the other guy before going though the southern gate.  There
is a treasure chest here (in the chamber at the base of the ladder), but
it's already opened (anyone know if there's supposed to be something in
it that you could have gotten earlier?)  In the Japanese version of FF7,
this is the place where you could have (supposedly) fought Test Zero,
(not that it's important now).

In the second area, talk to everyone here.  The building to the far
southeast is a bar, and a man inside will sell you items, and you can
sleep in the front truck part of the big rig.  After looking around here,
enter the building to the east (it doesn't matter which entrance you
take).  Barret will show up once you're inside, as will Tifa and Aeris.
After Barret's flashback (in which his best friend falls down a gorge and
North Corel is razed to the ground), reassemble your team and go back to
the first area.  Examine the guard (who is dead), then either leave
through the gate.  If you exit by going through the area between the gate
and the building to the right, you'll end up wandering around in a
wasteland until a caravan (the same one that Tifa was captured in) shows
up.  When it does, pick the top option to get a ride back to the area
beyond the gate or choose the bottom option to stay where you are (in
the middle of nowhere...you'll have to keep wandering around until the
caravan shows up again).

Anyway, once you've gone past the gate, talk to the man out here and go
to the _right_.  Any other direction leaves you stranded in the desert
(read the above paragraph again if you want to get back on track).  This
takes you to the caryard.  Go up from here and you'll run into none
other than Dyne (the guy from Barret's flashback).  He tells Barret
about Eleanor and Marlene (who is actually his daughter), then decides
to attack Barret.  In the battle, you're forced to fight using just
Barret, so make sure you equipped him with good stuff beforehand.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: DYNE                                  LV: 23  HP: 1200  MP: 20

The easiest way to kill this boss is simply let him hit you; his attacks
increase your Limit meter quickly.  Use the Restore materia to restore
lost life, then hit him with the Big Shot Limit Break when your meter
maxes out.  A summoning Materia (like Shiva or Ifrit) is also a good way
to inflict added damage.  Just make sure you have all the MPs you need,
and you can win in no time.  The boss can pull off a final attack before
dying, so keep your life up (but he can't do it if you kill him fast
enough).  You get a Silver Armlet for beating him.
_________________________________________________________________________

After Barret's friend dies, you'll find yourself back in the trailer.
After talking to Mr. Coates, you'll be invited to become a Chocobo
racer.  In the elevator shaft, choose the top option to have the racing
process explained to you, or pick the bottom one to skip it.  In the room
with the other men, check the alcove by the Chocobo poster for a red
Summon Materia (Ramuh).  Then, talk to the girl in pink (Ester) to start
racing.

Your controls as a Chocobo racer are:

S               Speed Up
X               Speed Down
O               Dash  (uses up your Dash Meter)
Select          Switch between Automatic and Manual control
R1+R2           Hold these buttons to refill your Dash Meter.

The more you Dash, the slower your walking speed is, so conserve your
Dash Meter for when you really need it.  You have to keep racing until
you win, so get good fast!  Ester will explain the controls to you again
prior to the race if you choose the top option, or you can conclude your
conversation with her and start racing by choosing the bottom option.
If you can't get the hang of it, then just keep racing using the
Automatic Sequence mode until you get first place.

Important:  Remember this!  You can refill your Dash Meter slowly by
holding down R1 + R2.  You can increase your Chocobo's walking speed
by holding L1 + L2 in addition to R1 + R2.  Keep this in mind if you
ever decide to become a chocobo jockey later on in the game.

After winning, you'll receive the Buggy as first prize, and can now roam
freely about the overworld and even pass through shallow rivers!  (Look
for lighter-shaded fords along the rivers.)  Your controls are set up in
the following manner:

X               Exit buggy
O               Enter buggy
T               Main Menu
Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
L2/R2           Change view

You _can_ run into enemies in the buggy, so be careful.  Also, you can
only return to the Golden Saucer if you take the ropeway from North
Corel Town; you can't get there using the buggy.  If you go across the
river south from the Golden Saucer and look around, you'll find a house
on a peninsula; you can't explore it yet, so ignore it for now.  BTW,
you can return to the desert if you get in the buggy, enter the desert
surrounding the Saucer, and touch the houses at the base of the Saucer.
However, you'll find that there's nothing to do here but wander through
the desert--do so long enough and the same cart that Tifa was abducted
in will pull up and offer you a ride back to your vehicle.  Choose the
top option to accept and the bottom option to stay where you are.  And
as the help menu indicates, it's possible to return to Junon Town and
take the Buggy with you.  After you've completed the scenario with Cid
and gotten the Tiny Bronco, you can explore the house on the peninsula;
you can also get Aeris' Level 4 Limit Break manual at that point in the
game.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.16  gongaga town / cosmo canyon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Fairy Tale, X-Potion x2, Titan materia, Deathblow
                     materia, Added Effect materia, Ether, Black M-phone,
                     X-Potion, Fairy Ring, Ether Turbo, Wizer Staff,
                     Gravity materia, Elixir.

                     You can get a second Elixir, a Magic Source, and the
                     FullCure materia here from Disc 2 onwards.

Now, head south from the Golden Saucer across the river.  You don't have
to go to Gongaga town right now if you don't want; while you can still
get the Deathblow and Titan materias later, you can't fight Reno or Rude,
nor can you get the treasure they're carrying.  In any case, go into the
black structure surounded by a forest, if you want to go to Gongaga.
Reno and Rude are here.  After Elena shows up and alerts the other Turks
to your presence, you'll be asked a question.  No matter what your
answer is, you'll have to fight Reno and Rude at the same time.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: RENO                                  LV: 22  HP: 2000 MP: 80
           RUDE                                  LV: 23  HP: 2000 MP: 135

Use Summoning spells to even the odds at the start of the round, then go
after either one.  Once you injure one enough times, he'll leave, then
the other one will.  It may be better to attack Rude, since he can heal
himself and Reno, but then again, Reno can inflict more damage.  In any
case, this fight isn't too hard either way.  You'll get a Fairy Tale and
a X-Potion should you win the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the Turks leave, head northeast, then go north to reach a pile of
scrapped machinery.  As you're looking around, Scarlet and Tseng show
up in the Shinra helicopter and talk about 'Huge Materia' (which you'll
learn more about in Disc 2).  After they leave, examine the area where
Scarlet was standing and choose the bottom option to get the Titan
materia.  Then go back to the first area and head left.  In the second
area, there is a Deathblow materia near the left path (which returns you
to the World Map).  If you take the north path, you'll arrive at Gongaga
Town.

Be sure to visit the stores (don't forget that you can climb up the pole
in the Accessory Shop to reach a room where you can buy weapons) and
get the treasure chests from the inn (X-Potion) and the old man's
house (White M-phone).  If you go into the far right house, you'll meet
an old couple who apparently know Cloud (or someone just like him), and
someone else named Zack.  When you're done here, return to the World
Map.  Head southwest, then turn toward the river and go over the
shallows, and then make your way up through the mountains to reach Cosmo
Canyon.  If you try to drive past the town, the buggy will short out,
so you don't really have any choice but to enter the town (and you can't
get anywhere else without the buggy, so even if you didn't drive it past
Cosmo Canyon and entered on foot, it wouldn't matter.  Note that if you
leave the Buggy and enter Cosmo without having your vehicle malfunction,
Bugenhagen won't mention that it was repaired to it when you leave).
There's an Elixir in the 'Shildra Inn' near the benches; this is the
same one the buggy repairman will tell you about if your buggy was
broken and you paid him in order to tell you about the Elixir.

When you approach the man at the gate, Red 13 will talk to him (he'll
either bound up the steps past your party if he's not with you, or he'll
just leave your party and start talking if he was with you previously).
Everyone here knows Red 13 by the name 'Nanaki'.  After Red heads up the
stairs, talk to the guard and choose the bottom option to be let into the
town (Red 13 will reappear to make sure you guys get in).  If he was in
your party, you'll have the option to make a new team; otherwise, you can
look around town freely.  Don't miss the Save Point located in the
Tigerlily Arms Shop.  In the Item Shop, there is a passage with a red
rope across it that prevents you from checking out the room in the back.
Keep this place in mind because if you return to Cosmo Canyon in Disc 2
or 3, the rope will have been removed and you can get an Elixir, a Magic
Source, and the FullCure materia orb from the back room.  Before
continuing your quest, go the the Shildra Inn.  On the left side of
the screen, hidden behind a bench, is a hard-to-spot Elixir that you'll
probably want to hold on to.

Eventually head up to the observatory, where you'll run into Red 13 and
Bugenhagen, an old geezer who knows all kinds of things.  After Red 13
leaves, go back down and talk to your friends in order to make a new
party.  Then talk to Red 13 in the room connected to the inn before
returning to the observatory.  Enter the side door, chat with Bugenhagen,
and you'll see a short FMV sequence.

When it's over, return to the large bonfire (the Cosmo Candle) to the
right of the entrance.  Your friends are here.  Talk to everyone here,
then chat with Red 13 a second time.  Bugenhagen will show up, and you'll
make a new group (with Red 13 as a permanent member).  If you want
someone else, just talk to another ally (it doesn't matter which one).
Follow Bugenhagen back to the sealed door above the weapons shop
and talk to him, then choose the top option.  He'll open the door for
you.  Enter and climb down to the very bottom of the shaft, then head
left.

In the next area, head right and up until you see a hole facing left*.
Enter it and you'll be given an option.  Pick the top one to make an
opening appear nearby.  Go through it, then head up and left.  You'll
slide on the oil and hit a spiked wall, reducing every member's HP by
500 points.  To avoid it, tap on the controller in order to make Cloud
inch is way across the oil (note that hitting the spikes can only
reduce a person's life to 1 HP.  However, if one of your members died
beforehand, they'll be revived with 1 HP!)  Then go south, through the
hole, and head right to reach the Added Effect materia you couldn't get
in the first area.  Go back and carefully _walk_ along the edge of the
path to avoid slipping across the oil.  Then go right, up, left, down the
stairs, and through the underpassage to reach a chest with an Ether
inside of it.  Then return to the stairs and go left, then down to find a
second chest containing a Black M-phone.  Then climb back up the stairs
and head to the upper-left to leave this area.

*  If you enter any of the other three holes, you'll be given the
   same option, but if you choose the top choice, you'll be attacked.
   Doing this doesn't seem to alter the level in any way, but you're
   better off doing this after you've cleared the _whole_ area out
   instead of doing it right now; I'd rather be safe than sorry, in
   my opinion.

There are five passages in this area; you only want to take the 2nd and
4th passages from the left.  First, take the 4th passage.  When you
touch the web beyond it, you'll have to fight a giant spider (Stinger).
When you've killed it, follow the path north to find a chest with an
X-Potion inside.  Then go back and take the 2nd passage from the left.
Kill the Stinger that attacks you when you touch the web and then head
left and down.  As you're going through the tunnel, hold right and
you'll find an alternate path that leads to yet another treasure chest.
You'll find a Fairy Ring in it.  Go back up to where the web was and
walk north to find another web.  Past it is the exit, but try holding
left and Cloud will go along a passage hidden by the rock that leads to
a chest.  There's an Turbo Ether inside.

When you approach the giant face in the next cavern, it begins to move
and you are attacked.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: GI NATTAK                            LV: 29  HP: 5500  MP: 200

Don't worry about the Soul Fires this boss has with him; just use your
Summon Materia, then concentrate on attacking and using Limit Breaks on
the big guy himself.  If your spell Materia has hit second level, then
iCE and Lightning work nicely on him.  You don't even need to worry
about your life much; the boss can be taken down before any serious
damage is done to your party.  You'll get a Wizer Staff should
you be successful in battle.  For a very quick kill, try using a Phoenix
Down or X-Potion, or cast Life on him, but be warned that it will take
quite a few tries to get it to work.
_________________________________________________________________________

Grab the spell Materia (Gravity) that's left behind and follow Bugenhagen
up the steps.  After the sequence with Red 13 and his father, Seto, make
a new party and leave the town.  Red 13 will rejoin you when you try to
leave.  Oh yes, the Buggy will be working again when you leave Cosmo
Canyon, and if it never blew up in the first place, well, it won't happen
anyway :)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.17  return of sephiroth
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Luck Source x2, Elixir x2, Platinum Fist, Turbo
                     Ether, Silver M-phone, Twin Viper, Enemy Launcher,
                     Magic Source, Destruct materia, Rune Blade, Platinum
                     Barrette, Powersoul, All Materia, Elemental Materia,
                     Sniper CR, Jem Ring, Counter Attack materia (if you
                     open up the safe in the mansion, you can get the
                     Cosmo Memory manual and the Odin materia, not to
                     mention a Key Item (Key to Basement).

                     You can also get 1 gil by playing the 'Highwind'
                     theme on the piano.  In Disc 2, you can get an
                     'Elemental Materia' and the 'Final Heaven' manual
                     (refer to section 8 for details).

Get in the buggy and continue past Cosmo Canyon.  Head north to find a
river with a shallow ford you can cross.  Past it, the mountains are
of a different type than what you usually see.  Near them is a small
town, Nibelheim.  Look familiar?  It's the same one Sephiroth and Cloud
went to in Cloud's flashback.

First, go into the inn.  Talk to the black creature in the back to get
a Luck Source.  You can get an Elixir from another one of the creatures
in the Item Shop, and a second Luck Source if you talk to the small
creatures in the upper floor of the southeastern house.  The large house
to the east is Tifa's home, and you'll be given a Platinum Fist and an
Turbo Ether if you talk to the creatures here.  There's a piano in
Tifa's room that you can fool around with, too (see section 8 for
details).

This next section is optional--you can just continue on through the
mountains if you want.  However, Sephiroth won't show up in the mansion
after you reach Disc 2, meaning you can't nab the Destruct materia
unless you get it from him during the first disc (read below for
details).

Now, go into the large mansion at the edge of town.  Left of the
entrance is a piece of paper written by a Shinra worker.  It has
several hints on it that clue you in to the combination of the safe on
the upper floor.  Here's where to find the safe numbers:

 - Search the other end of the broken piano in the west wing.
 - Open the chest in the greenhouse, then examine it again.
 - Search the hallway in the east wing, north from the bedroom.
 - Read the piece of paper and put the cursor on the blank space
   at the bottom.

Head right and look for the sliver of light near the stairway, it's
very hard to see.  It's an opening that leads to the lower section of
another room.  There's a chest here, with a Silver M-phone inside.
Go back out and go into the northern door beneath the staircase.  In
the adjoining hall, head right and and up to find a chest with a
Twin Viper in it.  To the left is a room with a broken piano (which
you could have also reached by looking for the opening near the left
9staircase in the main room).

Go up the stairs and head left.  In the circular room is a chest that
has an Enemy Launcher inside.  There's nothing in the northern room
except for a locked safe--you'll need the right combination in order
to open it (see section  if you don't know how).  If you want to
try your luck, examine it with the O button and choose the top option
to enter the combination or the bottom option to quit.

Open the safe (or not), then go right and into the right wing of the
manor house.  If you go up, you'll find a chest with a Magic Source
inside.  Then go into the lower room and examine the curved wall to
open a secret passage.  Go down the spiraling walkway, and then head
right.  If you got the gold key from the safe, you can open the
northern door (refer to section 14 for details).  Continue to the
right to find a library.  Then go north and you'll run into none
other than Sephiroth, who will pelt you with a green materia before
flying away.  Be sure to get the materia (Destruct) before
leaving the mansion.

Once you're back outside, leave Nibelheim from the northern entrance
and continue along until you see a passage leading into the mountains.
In the next area, follow the path until it splits, and take the north
path, which wraps around the back of a spire and leads to a chest
with a Rune Blade inside of it.  Now go back and follow the original
path.  You'll notice that just before the bridge, there's a path that
curves away to the north.  Follow it up into the mountains and when
it curves south, take that path instead of continuing in the same
direction.  The path curves several times, but eventually you'll make
it to the top of the mountain, where you can find a chest with a
Plus Barrette.  It may help if you press SELECT so that you can see
yourself when a mountain is blocking your view, and if you can't seem
to get any further, press in other directions (like down) to scale the
back of the mountain.

Go back down to the main path and head up the bridge.  Inside the
cavern, take the ladder down instead of the tubes, or you won't be
able to get all the treasure in this area unless you climb back up and
unfold the ladders from the bottom (is this possible in the US version?
It wasn't in the Japanese one).  You don't have to worry about the
large boss near the door just yet.  Feel free to make use of the Save
Point, then climb back to the top of the area.  Enter the pipe labeled
'2' to end up on a rocky ledge.  There's an item bag here with a
Powersoul inside; get it and then press down to jump down to a lower
ledge, then press down again to reach the floor.  Climb back up one last
time and go into the pipe labled '4' in order to reach the treasure
chest on the bottom ledge below; there's an All materia lying within.
Walk against the right edge of the ledge to drop down to the floor.
Notice that the treasure chest is repeatedly opening and closing?  It's
just a glitch, one that (surprisingly) wasn't in the Japanese version.

See the path heading south, just below the path that the boss is
blocking?  Follow it to go outside, then try to keep walking and you'll
drop down to the lower ledge.  Following the path here leads to a dead
end, so enter the cave instead and take the righthand path once you're
inside.  Ignore the exit at the other end of the cave and work your way
southwest, then go through the small hole.  Walk up, then left, then
down in order to reach the treasure chest you could see when you first
came in here.  Inside it is an Elixir.  Now go through the exit to
arrive at a wooded area.  On the ground, to the left of the mass of
crystallized Materia is an Elemental materia.  Take it and proceed north,
going through the opening to go back into the caves.

Inside, head to the right, then go up as far as you can and walk left
past the stone walls to reach a chest containing a Sniper CR.  Then
go back and take the rightmost passage.  It goes south and leads you
back to the outside.  From here, head left (going right leads you to
a dead end).  You'll eventually end up at the Jenova Plant you visited
in Cloud's flashback.  There's nothing to do inside the plant, so
continue beyond it to the door set in the rock wall.  Enter it and
you'll end up back in the chamber with the pipes again.

It's true that you could have taken the door and done this entire
sequence in reverse, but then you couldn't have scaled the ledge and
you would have to go all the way back, instead of taking the express
route like you just did :)  Now climb down and examine the boss, and
it will attack you.

BOSS TIPS: MATERIA KEEPER                       LV: 38  HP: 8400  MP: 300

Don't use Fire-related attacks; it'll only heal him.  Red 13's Limit
Break B1/1 works well, as does Cloud's B2/1 Limit Break.  I'd also
suggest using the 'Choco/Mog' materia as much as you can--it's ability to
stun this boss is very useful.  Physical attacks should do the trick if
you have good weapons; save your MPs for healing yourselves.  Cure2
combined with the All Materia are a good combination (remember to link
them when selecting holders) if you want to stay alive, since the boss
can inflict 300-800 points of damage with its stabbing/mauling attacks.
Also, he can heal himself (around 1000 hp's worth), and use the damaging
Trine skill, which causes about 500 points of damage to all those still
alive.  If Red's learned his B1/2 break or someone knows Haste, it would
be a wise idea to use it at the start of the round.  Since the Materia
Keeper is one of the few enemies that can use Trine, it comes highly
recommended that you have a Enemy Skill materia equipped so that you can
learn this enemy technique.  You'll get a Jem Ring should you be
victorious.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the battle is over, examine the purple materia that is left behind
in order to take it (Counter).  Then follow the path outside--it leads
back to the World Map.

  3.18  the inventor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Power Source, Yoshiyuki, Drill Arm, Edincoat.

Head southwest, then turn north (you're making a big C around the
mountains).  Keep walking and you'll see Rocket Town up ahead.  In
the Accessory Shop, you'll recieve a message if you go to the left end
of the counter and examine it (anyone know what it means?)  If you go
into the house farthest to the right, you can find a chest with a
Power Source inside of it in next to the stove.  Then talk to the old man
standing near the house that's just left of the rocket's launch pad.
Talk to him again, and he'll ask you a question.  Pick the top answer
and the view will pan up to show the rocket.  Then the old geezer will
give you the Yoshiyuki; it's a weapon for Cloud.

Go into the house to the right of the old man.  This is the home of
Shera and Cid, although neither of them are around at the moment.
There's a chest here with a Drill Arm inside it.  If you go out the
back entrance, you'll find a light airplane in the backyard--it's one
of Cid's inventions, the 'Tiny Bronco'.  After looking at the airplane,
Shera will show up.  When she leaves, go outside and head north to
arrive at the rocket--climb inside it to find Cid.  After chatting with
him, name him.  You can then ask him several questions; you have to at
least ask the first one (top choice) in order to proceed with the game.
Then leave the rocket and return to Cid's house.  Shera will show up,
then Cid, too.  After Cid goes out back, Shera will explain how Cid
was going to pilot his rocket into outer space some time ago, but
aborted the launch when he discovered that Shera was still making last-
minute checks and hadn't left the launch pad yet; she would be burned
to ashes since the launch could only be aborted, not delayed.  By saving
her life, Cid's dreams were shattered, since he did not have the
resources to repair the rocket, which tipped over after falling back
onto the launch pad.

Cid comes back into the house, then Palmer shows up--an employee of
Shinra.  Go outside and you'll run into Rufus and a Shinra guard, who
have come to 'borrow' the Tiny Bronco.  After Shera brings you back
inside the house, go out the back entrance to find Palmer standing
atop the Tiny Bronco.  Talk to him and he'll attack you.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: PALMER                               LV: 38  HP: 6000  MP: 240

His Mako Gun causes a fair amount of damage since it has the effects of
Fire 2, Ice 2, and Bolt 2, so make sure Aeris is in your party (for her
Healing Wind ability) or that you have some Restore Materia.  Use Haste
and All on your party as well as Slow magic and/or Summon Chocobo on him
to even the odds a bit.  You'll want to have Cloud's B2/2 by now--it
comes in handy.  Your prize for beating Palmer is an Edincoat.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the boss gets wasted (he's not dead, though) your party and Cid
will escape on the Tiny Bronco.  Although it gets damaged during your
flight, it can still be used to skim across shallow water and traverse
rivers (although you can't go up or down waterfalls).  Here are the
airplane controls:

X               Exit airplane
O               Enter airplane
Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
L2/R2           Change view


You now have several options that are available to you: you can get
Aeris' Level 4 Limit Break manual (see section 8 for details) or go on
Yuffie's sub-quest (if you have her in your party, see section 6 for
further information).  Even if you don't have Yuffie, you can purchase
some pretty good weapons and find some treasure chests lying around in
Wutai, so you may want to stop there anyways.  You can even go back and
kill Midgar Zolom, if you've been itching to do so (you'll now have
enough HPs to learn the enemy skill 'Beta' from it without dying). In
any case, it would be a good idea to explore other areas and pick up
items you missed/buy stuff you couldn't afford before instead of
continuing on your quest just yet.  I would suggest checking out Bone
Village, to the north, since you can pick up the powerful 'Summon Kjata'
materia there as well as buy some useful bracelets and items.

  3.19  betrayal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Protect Vest, Choco Feather, Elixir.

Pilot the Tiny Bronco back to the Gold Saucer area.  Go to the weapon
smith's house on the peninsula near the desert and talk to him--he'll
explain that you need the Keystone, which he no longer has.  Get back in
Cid's airplane, and leave it on the shore by the desert.  You need to
get to the Golden Saucer, so either walk or find a wild Chocobo and ride
it back to North Corel.  Then take the ropeway up to the Gold Saucer.
Go to the Battle Square and look for an opening on the right side of the
room labled 'Dio's Show Room'.  Inside, examine the glittering object on
top of the large stand; it's the Keystone.  Dio, the big lug who threw
you out of the Gold Saucer before, will show up and offer you a
challenge: fight in the Battle Square and he'll give you the Keystone.
When you have a choice, pick the top option to accept or the bottom
option to temporarily decline.  You'll now have to fight in the Battle
Square using only Cloud.  Keep in mind that even if you lose the very
first battle, Dio will still give you the Keystone.

If you want to try and see if you can win all the battles, then keep
fighting.  After each battle, the message 'GREAT!' will appear,
followed by two options.  Choose the right option to stop fighting,
or the left option to continue fighting.  If you choose to continue,
a jackpot-like device will appear.  You can stop it from spinning
by pressing the O button, and whatever comes up when you press O will
take affect prior to the start of the next battle.  Depending on what
you get, different things will happen to you, although certain
accessories can render you immune to some of the more debilitating
effects.

Furthermore, the status ailments that you are afflicted with as a
result of the jackpot stay with you from battle to battle, and you're
forced to stop the jackpot after each battle, so you could end up
being a poisoned, petrified frog in a few rounds, if you're not
careful.  If you last through seven battles, then the fighting ends.

Refer to 'Having Fun' (Sec. 7.6) for a complete explanation of how the
Battle Square works, but keep in mind that although you will earn
Battle Points during the battle, they are reset to zero when the battle
ends since you end up in the Show Room (and the way things work you lose
all the Battle Points you earn if you leave the main room at any time).
Should you make it through all the battles, Dio will give you a Protect
Vest and a Choco Feather, in addition to the Keystone.

There's nothing else you need to do at the Gold Saucer now, but when
you try to leave, you'll discover that the ropeway that the sky lift
travels up and down is broken, leaving you stranded in the Saucer.
Cait Sith will either show up (or leave your party, if he's already
with you guys) and suggest that you all meet him at the Ghost Hotel.
At the Hotel, you and your allies will chat for awhile.  In the next
scene, you'll find yourself in your room.

At this point in the game, a character will come into your room and ask
to go on a date with you.  While it's usually Aeris, you can go on a
date with Tifa, Yuffie, or even Barret.

Chances are, your date will be with Aeris, because if you are nice to
her even once, you're stuck with her.  I was trying to get Yuffie to go
with me and was mean to everyone but her, and I still got stuck with
Tifa.  If anyone out there knows how to get Tifa or Barret consitently
and would like to share the method with me, I'd happily add it to the
FAQ.  For now though, you can thank two resourceful contributors for this
step-by step guide to getting Yuffie as your date.

Keep in mind that it's based on the Japanese version of the game, so
the conversations/events may seem a little different.  Also credit is

Everyone likes Yuffie, the 14 year old ninja with spunk. Finally, you
can do the ultimate (clean) fantasy - you can date Yuffie!  But then 
half the fun of slaving through the guide is the fact that you can kick 
dirt in Aeris and Tifa's face, call them worthless, irresponsible and 
ugly, and they'll STILL like you in the end! So here we go:

DISCLAIMER

This was originally taken from a Japanese guide, but has been translated
and edited for the English version.  Also credit is given to the 
original writer of this guide, whomever he may be.  The original writer,
translater and editor will not claim responsibility if you read through
this guide and it essentially destroys the first half of the game.  I've
dated Yuffie, obviously, so it can be done, however, I suggest you play
the game 'straight' first, as some key parts are missed (Honey Bee Inn,
talk with Zack's parents).  This is best followed when you play through
a second time.

GENERAL TIPS FOR DATING YUFFIE

 Always try to have Red 13 and Barret in your party before getting 
 Yuffie.  After getting Yuffie, make sure she's always the second 
 character, unless specified otherwise, (like when a character 
 insists on joining you).  The third character can be anybody but one 
 of the girls (unless specified otherwise).

 - When you talk to allies, always talk to Yuffie first.

 - If you're in doubt when making choices, remember the object is of 
   getting Tifa/Aeris's favour of you down (that is, be nasty to them), 
   and getting Yuffie's favour of you up.

 - Finally, make sure the Cover materia is always equipped on Cloud when
   Yuffie's in your party, so that he can protect her.

 - Below is what choices you need to make to date Yuffie - don't be
   daunted by the number of instructions.  And note that skipping out on
   a minor choice or two is fine, but watch for the major ones. Good 
   luck dating Yuffie!

72. At Cosmo Canyon, talk to Yuffie (she's in the materia shop,
    surprise, surprise!)
73. In the Planetarium, put Yuffie and Cait Sith into the party.
74. When you're around the Cosmo Candle, talk in this order: Yuffie, 
    Barret, Aeris, Tifa, Red.

    Sephiroth.
77. In the Rocket Town, when you get the Tiny Bronco, listen to 
    Yuffie when she says, 'Lets go to the west (to Wutai).'
78. At Wutai, Yuffie takes your materia. At this time, although
    there'll be less members, do not replace Yuffie before she runs
    off.
79. After the battle with the Shinra Soldiers, choose your party
    between Vincent, Cait Sith, Cid, and Red.
80. At Wutai, when you've caught Yuffie, pull the left lever as she
    says.
81. Finish the Wutai events.
82. Try and beat the Pagoda. I managed to beat the four-face boss by
    using the ???? enemy skill, maxing her with HP Plus materia and 
    keeping Yuffie just high enough so that she survives if he uses
    Beast Sword.
83. Then go to Gold Saucer, get the Keystone, and watch the date
    sequence begin!

Congratulations!  You should now date Yuffie!  And remember, say
SOMETHING! :)

PS. You can actually 'date' Barret also. I haven't done this, but some
people in Japan have. If you want to try this, I can't help you, except
to perhaps do everything in this guide that hurts Tifa and Aeris and
don't pick up Yuffie until the last possible minute.

(back to the FAQ)

It's likely that this guide could be used to date any character, if
you replace Yuffie with (Aeris/Tifa/Barret) and make your choices
accordingly, adjusting them for who you're trying to get.  Anyway, once
the date sequnce starts up, here's what to do:

First, you'll go to the Event Square.  Since you're the 100th person
to come here that day, you and Aeris will be offered a role in the
upcoming play.  What you do here doesn't affect the game in any way,
so just pick whatever options you'd like and watch one of the many
humorous endings.  If I wrote it out, it would ruin the fun, so....
Next, you'll ride the gondola in the Round Square.  When your partner
looks out the window, you can press left to look out, too, and see
various FMV sequences showcasing the events at the Gold Saucer.

After the date is over, Cloud and his date will return to the Station
Square only to find Cait Sith sneaking around with the Keystone.  He'll
run away when Cloud yells at him, and you have to chase him around
various sections of the Gold Saucer.  (If you don't want to waste time
doing that, then go to the Chocobo Square, enter it, and chase Cait
Sith back outside).  Eventually, Cait will stop at the steps outside
of the Chocobo Square.  The Shinra helicopter shows up, and Cait will
toss the Keystone up to Tseng.  When confronted by Cloud and your ally,
Cait reveals that he is in fact a spy for the Shinra.  He insists that
he continues to travel with Cloud and his friends because he has taken
Marlene as a hostage back in Midgar.

Once Cait Sith leaves, you'll find yourself back in the Ghost Hotel.
Check the iron maiden for an Elixir (notice the sound it makes; it
sounds just like Norstein Bekkler's laugh [the guy from Chrono
Trigger!]).  Leave the room to meet up with your allies again.  After
a brief talk, Aeris will join your party, becoming a permanent member.
Pick another ally and then leave the Saucer, since the ropeway is now
repaired.

Now that you're back at North Corel, leave and return where you parked
the Tiny Bronco.  Look at the World Map.  See the tiny chain of islands
near the bottom of the map?  Just to the right of them and to the left
of Mideel and the Fort Condor is a large island.  If you go there, you'll
see a large temple surrounded by a forest.  This is your next
destination, so land the Tiny Bronco at the shore and head to the temple.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.20  the temple of the ancients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Trident, Mind Source, Silver Rifle, Turbo Ether x2,
                     Rocket Punch, Luck Plus materia, Morph materia,
                     Princess Guard, Ribbon, Trumpet Shell, Megalixir,
                     Nail Bat, Work Gloves, Dragon Armlet, Bahamut
                     materia, Gigas Armlet.

At the top of the temple is a black creature, similar to the ones you
met in Nibelheim.  If you talk to it, it floats into the air in a flash
of light.  Inside the temple, you'll find the Turk, Tseng.  He was badly
wounded by Sephiroth.  He gives you the Keystone so that you can go after
his attacker; examine the dais in the center of the room and you'll be
transported into the depths of the temple.

This area has a very confusing layout; it's a mass of stairs, walkways
and passages.  There are chests everywhere, and a kooky old man in a
blue robe is also running around down here.  From where you arrived,
head up, then left, then up again and go down the stairs to the ground
level.  There's an opening just above you; go in it, turn to the right,
then climb down the vines clinging to the wall beneath you.  If you
run underneath the long staircase nearby, you can reach a treasure chest
that has a Trident inside of it.  From there, head right, go down the
stairs, then turn and climb up the wall using the vines.  Head past the
opening (which you can't enter at this point, anyway) and go up the
stairs.  The old man will dash away; ignore him for now and climb up the
vines to reach a platform.  There's a shiny pink item here (Mind Source).
Take it and go down the stairs, then enter the door to your left to find
a room with a treasure chest and the old man.  Inside the chest is the
Silver Rifle.  Talk to the geezer twice and he'll offer his services
to you:

 - Purchase Items
 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game*
 - Nothing

*  Choose the top option to decline or the bottom option to accept and
   save your game.

Outside, go back up the stairs and down the vines, but this time, head
down and to the left.  You can pick up a green item here (Turbo Ether).
Then go down the long stairway.  At the bottom, climb down the smaller
set of steps to your left, then work your way towards the southwest
corner of the screen.  There's a small patch of vines here that you can
climb down.  Be sure to open the nearby chest; there's a Rocket Punch
inside of it.  Now, go down the stairs and walk northeast along the
path to find some more vines and the old man, who scampers away when
you get too close.  Climb up the vines, then go up the stairs next to
you, go through the archway, turn east and go down the stairs, and
climb up the long stretch of vines on the nearby wall.  Head left,
underneath the staircase, and you can nab a purple materia (Luck Plus).

Now, go back the way you came (go right, down the vines, up the stairs
and down and out through the archway so that you're back on the path
that the old man was standing on, just above the vines).  Walk to the
east until the path stops, then head south and turn east again to enter
the nearby door.  As you enter, the old man will dash away.  There are
huge hollow boulders that are rolling down this walkway.  To get past
them, time your dashes so that the hollow part will be directly over
you, causing Cloud to kneel as the boulder rolls over you.  Then keep
going until you reach a side path that leads to a pool of water.  Grab
the Morph materia near the pool, then continue along the
walkway, avoiding the boulders.  Once you reach the end of the path,
they'll disappear for good, but remember that if you get hit by a
boulder, you'll be dragged all the way back to the beginning of the
path (ouch!)  Alternately, you can wait until the boulders disappear and
then go back and pick up the materia after the sequence with Sephiroth.

Once the boulders are gone, Aeris will sense a powerful prescence in
the chamber and return to the pool.  Light will erupt from the surface
of the pool, and you'll be able to see what I presume is a flashback of
Tseng and Elena (both Turks) running around in the shrine.  After Elena
leaves, Sephiroth shows up and creates a double of himself.  While he
busies himself with attacking Tseng, the laughing double flies up into
the air.  After this sequence is over, Sephiroth's double will descend
into the pool and then fly away.  When you return to the end of the
passage, the old geezer will be waiting for you, and will once again
offer his help:

 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game
 - Nothing

When you're ready, go down the stairs.  There's a huge room here with
twelve doors labeled I to XII.  In the center of the room is the ever-
annoying talking clock.  In the Japanese version of FF7, this puzzle
was very tricky and I had a whole section written on it.  But in the US
version, it's a simple matter of moving the clock hands around; so I
won't bother with it.  There are twelve passages (labeled I to XII), and
you get to explore them by setting the clock to various positions.
Here's a list of what's in each passage:

        I       -  When you open up the chest, you'll be attacked by
                   monsters.  You won't get anything for beating them,
                   either.

The Poison Frogs are weak against Ice, so use cold-based attacks/spells
on them.  Their attacks will turn you into a frog, but they attack so
often that it's better for you to wait until they hit you again (turning
you back into a human) instead of wasting a Maiden's Kiss or other
restorative item.  The woman (Gemini Sumi) is weak against Poison, so
use one of the Bio spells on her for good results.  The only point in
fighting this battle is if you want to learn Frog Song from the frogs
(providing you have a Enemy Skill materia equipped).
_________________________________________________________________________

        II      -  This passage is blocked off by rocks.  You can't
                   do anything here, so return and pick another path.

        III     -  A treasure chest.  It contains monsters, too.
                   You won't get anything for defeating them.

Both of these red, multi-eyed monsters are weak against Poison, so use
the best Bio spell you've got, or simply attack to dispatch them.  If
you've got Morph equipped, you can morph both of them into Magic Source
items, which is really the only point in fighting this battle.  Although
weak, either enemy can drain _lots_ of HP from you (around 1200-1400
points!)
_________________________________________________________________________

        IIII    -  Shouldn't this be IV?  Anyway, there's a chest
                   here, and Aeris's Ultimate Weapon, the
                   Princess Guard is inside.

        V       -  This passage leads outside to the gold chest you
                   could see but not normally reach.  Inside it is
                   a Ribbon.

        VI      -  Read below to find out what to do here.

        VII     -  There's a chest here.  A weapon for Cait Sith,
                   the Trumpet Shell, is inside it.

        VIII    -  You can get a Megalixir from the chest in
                   this room.

        IX      -  A passage blocked by fallen rock.

        X       -  This is where you came in, bud!

        XI      -  Yet another blocked passage.

        XII     -  What a creepy room!  You'll be seeing more of
                   it soon enough.

At some point, you should stand on the hour or minute hand and let the
second hand approach.  When it passes over you, it will knock you down
into the pit below.  When you land, you'll find yourself in a room with
a treasure chest.  Before you can open it, you'll be ambushed by two
monsters.

           ANCIENT DRAGON                       LV: 34  HP: 2400  MP: 450
                                                (weak against Gravity)

Using Demi or some Summon Materia will kill these dragons quickly.
Even physical attacks work well.  Either enemy can only attack for about
500 points of damage, or use a Southern Cross attack that hits one enemy
for the same amount of damage, so they don't pose too serious a threat.
You can also control them, even though they're bosses.  You'll win an
Turbo Ether for defeating both of them.
_________________________________________________________________________

In the chest is the Nail Bat, the strongest weapon Cloud can get during
Disc 1.  Take it and leave the room.  You'll find yourself back at the
door you couldn't enter earlier (in the area with the vines and
staircases.  Simply work your way back to the talking clock, and pick
up any items you might have missed the first time around.

PASSAGE VI
Before going down this passage, make sure you've cleared out the other
rooms since you won't be able to go back to them after the next event.
When you step out into the open, the bouncing old man will see you and
run away.  When Aeris asks you a question, pick the bottom answer if
you want to return and explore more of the clock puzzle room, or
choose the top answer if you want to hunt down the old man.  To find
him, simply go through the passages; you want to end up going into a
passage that he plans to come out of.  You can go down to another set
of passages by going to the left end of each ledge and pressing the O
button to jump down a level.  You can catch him without too much
difficulty.  Don't forget to take the chest lying on the lowest level;
there's a pair of Work Gloves inside.  As usual, beat the old man at his
own game and he'll help you in return:

 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game
 - Nothing

Now that you've caught the old man, the large door on the top level will
open.  Go inside and head to the right.  You'll encounter Sephiroth four
times.  Up to his usual evil, Sephiroth talks about the energy within
the temple as he as swings his sword around, his every motion trailed by
the double that he made earlier.  After disappearing, Cloud will suffer
from some sort of fit.  Once he comes to his senses, the party examines
a mural on the wall which shows a meteorite speeding towards the people
of the earth.  Aeris talks about the spell 'Meteo' which Sephiroth is
planning to cast, when the party hears Sephiroth's voice.  The temple
starts to shake, and a large red dragon appears and attacks the allies.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: RED DRAGON                           LV: 39  HP: 6800  MP: 300

Slow the dragon and Haste yourself to gain the upper hand.  Some Summon
Materia will also even the odds, but don't use Kjata since it will heal
the boss by about 2100 points.  Also, Demi won't work against it.
Limit Breaks and physical attacks should do the trick.  You'll win a
Dragon Armlet should you win the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

Pick up the summon materia that's left behind (Bahamut).  Then go back
and examine the floating gold object on the dais.  It's actually the
Black Materia.  You have the option of touching the Black Materia, it
doesn't matter which answer you choose.  At this point, if Cait Sith
isn't in your party, you'll here a ringing sound and Cloud will answer
the PHS phone.  Cait will talk to him through the phone.  If he is in
your party, then he starts hopping around and talking to you.  When he
finishes, leave this chamber, let the old man heal you if you need it,
then go back to the clock room.  The only direction you can go in is
straight up to passage XII.  When you examine the door in the room
beyond, yet another boss appears to finish you off.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS:  DEMONS GATE                        LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 400

The bad news is that the boss can hit for lots of damage.  The good news
is that most of his attacks (especially the Cave-in and Demon Rush
attacks) quickly max out your Limit bars.  Now's a good time to try out
the Bahamut materia, but most other Summon materia don't do much damage.
Make good use of Aeris's B1/1 and Cloud's B2/2, and you'll want to
Barrier and Haste yourselves.  Luckily, this boss can't instantly kill
you as a similar boss in FF2 could.  You'll win a Gigas Armlet from
this boss if you're victorious.  It's been said that you can kill him
using Life or a Phoenix Down...is this true?
_________________________________________________________________________

Once the boss is defeated, Cait Sith will have an animated conversation
with your party.  If he's not in your group, then he bursts out of the
door and starts talking.  He'll then return to the chamber where the
Black Materia was and take it.  Afterwards, the entire temple is
destroyed.  In the following scene, Cloud and Aeris go down into the
foundation of the temple and retrieve the Black Materia, but Sephiroth
shows up and forces Cloud to give the Materia to him.  During this time,
you control a ghostly image of Cloud as a child.  If you stand in
Cloud's path and keep talking to him, you'll prevent him from
approaching Sephiroth, but there's no point in doing this since Cloud
will continue to advance until you give up.  After Cloud gives Sephiroth
the Black Materia, he will attack Aeris (and you can't do anything about
that, either).  Cait Sith will show up (actually Cait Sith 2--the same
person, but with a new robot body since the first one got trashed when
the temple was destroyed.  He sure got there fast, huh?)  Then your
other party member will leap down and prevent Cloud from killing Aeris.

After what I take to be a dream sequence, you'll awake in, of all
places, the inn at Gongaga Town, with Barret and Tifa by your side.
Answer Barret's question any way you like, then go outside.  Tifa and
Barret will join your party, but you don't have to keep them as
permanent members.  Look for the Tiny Bronco on the southern shore near
Gongaga Town.

Also, Aeris has left your party for good.  You'll also lose any equipment
or materia she had equipped, apparently.  Now, you need to go to the
forest that you saw in Cloud's dream.  First, get in the Tiny Bronco.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.21  bone village / sleeping forest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Buntline, Kjata materia, Water Ring.

Make your way up to the Northern Continent by going around the left side
of the Western Continent after going along the river by the Gold Saucer.

Head to the right edge of the continent, where you'll find a forest
surrounded by mountains.  In the middle of the forest is a big rib cage
and a large skull.  Approach it, and you'll find yourself in a excavation
site where a bunch of archaeologists spend their time digging.  Before
doing anything else, you might want to head up the ladder and go through
the hole in the back to reach the Sleeping Forest, the same one from
Cloud's dream.  Keep walking until you reach the second forest screen.
If you stand here for a moment, you'll see a red Materia floating on the
left side of the screen.  It will switch to the right side and back again
every few seconds.  Try to predict where it will show up and use the O
button to grab it.  Your reward is the Kjata materia.  If you try to
continue through the forest, you'll find that this screen repeats
endlessly.  So, go back outside.  Before going on to the next part of
the game, you may want to buy some bracelets and items; talk to the
man sitting near the rib cage and pick the second option in order to
buy things from him.

What you need to do at this point in the game is commission one of the
men to dig up the Lunar Harp for you.  As long as you have it in your
possession, you're able to pass through the Sleeping Forest.

 - First, talk to the man sitting just outside of the rib-cage room.
   Pick the first option twice*.  The screen will fade out.

 - When the screen fades back in, all the men will be gone.  What you
   do is choose a place where you want a digger to stand and press the
   S button.  It costs 100 gil to place a digger.  Use the top option
   to place a digger, or the bottom option to quit.  You can place up
   to five diggers.

 - You'll quit once you choose the bottom option or after you've placed
   five diggers.  Now, press the S button to set off an explosion.
   You'll hear a music cue, and the diggers will turn in different
   directions.

 - Stand where you want one of the diggers to search through the night
   and press S again after clearing the dialogue box.  You'll find
   yourself back at the bottom of the screen the next morning.  The
   treasure chest nearby will be closed, and it may or may not hold an
   item, depending on where you chose to dig.

 - The key to getting the right item is to watch the diggers after the
   explosion occurs.  They'll all look toward the location of the item
   you need, so try placing them in compass-point style layout so that
   you can follow their vision to the place where the item lies.  If
   you're really stuck, the Lunar Harp lies just a little ways to the
   west and ever so slightly south of the tent on the upper ledge.

*  Normally, the first option is used to dig for the Lunar Harp (all
   the diggers will look in the direction of the harp).  The other
   two options are used to dig up other items (the diggers will look
   in the direction of the closest item/next item to be found).  But
   not only do you not have to place diggers in order to find an item,
   but you can use any of the three choice to dig up the Runahaapu or
   any other item--it's just that the diggers won't look in the correct
   direction if you don't use the first option, and you can't use the
   first option after obtaining the Lunar Harp.

How do you know if you got the right item?  Well, it will show up on the
Key Item menu (where the important stuff like the PHS is kept).  Also, if
you talk to the digger sitting by the room, and choose the first option
twice, he won't let you select and place diggers.  Finally, try going
into the forest.  If the screen turns green, then you've got the right
item.

When you've got Lunar Harp, go into the forest.  When you reach the
second area, the screen changes to a green color, and the forest will no
longer repeat.  Beyond the forest is a rocky area.  First, go under the
tree trunk to reach the treasure chest with a Water Ring inside.  Climb
up the rocks near the pink mass of coral, then go through the fallen
trunk and head north to reach the next area (you can't climb up the vine
in the first area, so ignore it).  Walk along the curving path and you'll
find yourself back in the World Map, in the canyon near the forest.  Head
straight forward to the top-like object to continue your quest.

If you have Vincent in your party, you can also get a weapon for him
here, the 'Buntline'.  Search for 'good treasure' and dig a few steps
above the tallest latter, a bit to the right.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.22  forgotten capital / forgotten city
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Magic Source, Aurora Armlet, Comet materia, Guard
                     Source, Elixir, Enemy Skill materia, Wizard Brace.

This area looks a lot like the floor of the sea; there's shells and coral
everywhere.  At the crossroads, take the left path.  It leads to a stone
building--inside of the building is a Save Point, and there's a chest on
the upper ledge with a Magic Source inside it.  There is a patch of
glowing green light here that conveys the 'message of the Ancients', but
I've never been able to do anything with it.  Leave the building and
continue past it, following the path east into the rock face.  Inside,
go down the stairs and head all the way right to find a chest with an
Aurora Armlet in it.  You can check out the blue crystal if you want,
but there's nothing you can do with it at this point in the game.  Return
to the crossroads and take the middle path.  Enter the shell building and
climb the spiraling walkway to the very to to find a green materia lying
on the ground (Comet).  Go back to the crossroads yet again and take
the right road.  It leads to an area with several shell buildings.  Go
all the way to the right, then go north to enter the building before you.
Climb all the way to the top level.  There's a chest here containing a
Guard Source.

There's nothing else to do in this area but enter the last shell house;
your friends won't let you take the path leading out of the city, and
the main path leads to another part of the chamber with the blue crystal,
but there's nothing you can do there.  So, if you're ready to proceed,
enter the shell house to the right of the main path.  On the ground
floor is a chest holding an Elixir.  Take it and climb up the ladder.
When you approach the beds, you'll be given an option.  You can choose
the bottom option, grab the yellow materia behind the headboard of the
third bed (Enemy Skill), exit the house, then enter it again,
approach the beds, and choose the top option to go to sleep.  Or, you can
just pick the top option the first time around, go to sleep, and when you
wake up in the night, grab the materia (it's easier to see at night,
too).  Originally, I though this was a 'bug' materia (don't I feel silly
now), but it's not.

No matter what you decide to do, go to sleep when you're ready to.
You'll wake up in the middle of the night.  After Cloud's companions join
him, return to the crossroads a final time and take the middle path
again.  When you enter the shell building, the fish floating in the
middle of the spiraling passageway will have disappeared; there are blue
steps in it's place.  Go down them and you'll find yourself in an
underwater palace.  At the bottom of the stairs, leave the building and
take note of the Save Point before going down both sets of stairs below.

Aeris is here, and you have to get to her by jumping across several
pillars.  Press in the direction of the next pillar to get proceed,
but you'll have to use just Cloud; your allies will wait for you back
on the ground.  Once you get close to Aeris, Cloud has another spastic
fit and will draw his sword.  You can press the controller and the
buttons to make Cloud do different things, but pressing O three times
will make him try to strike Aeris.  Luckily, he'll come to his senses
beforehand with some help from his friends, but Sephiroth makes an
appearance and attacks Aeris.  After her death, Sephiroth escapes,
leaving behind another monster in his wake.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: JENOVA*LIFE                         LV: 50  HP: 10000  MP: 300

This boss is weak against earth attacks, so use Earth and Titan.  Also,
Comet, Bahamut, and Kjata all work very well.  Physical attacks do a
surprising amount of damage.  The boss will cast Reflect on itself the
first time you cast a spell on it, so be wary about using spells too
often.  Jenova*Life's attacks are not that strong (about 400-700 points),
but it has an ultra-deadly blue bubble attack (Aqualung) that inflicts
+1500 damage to each character.  Be sure to have some Restore Materia
handy.  Considering it's the last boss on this disc, this is not a very
hard battle.  You'll get a Wizard Bracelet when you win the battle.  Be
sure to have a Enemy Skill materia equipped if you haven't gotten
Aqualung already.
_________________________________________________________________________

After beating the boss, there's another FMV sequence, then you're given
the option to save your game.  Guess what?  You just finished Disc One!

Now before you go any farther, please realize something.  Aeris is dead,
and she stays that way for the rest of the game.  You cannot revive her,
restore her, or ever see her again (in the flesh, that is--you'll see
her again when Bugenhagen and you return to the Forgotten Capital in
Disc 2).  So...wipe your eyes, keep an old save file if you want to
play with her from time to time, or use a GameShark code (see section 8)
to put her back in your party in a later disc.  Ready to go?  Pop in
Disc 2 and keep playing!


=========================================================================
  4.  DISC TWO WALKTHROUGH
=========================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.1  the cave
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Viper Halberd, Bolt Armlet, HypnoCrown,
                     Megalixir, Magic Plus materia, Power Source.

You'll start off outside of one of the shell-shaped buildings on the east
side of the Ancient City.  If you walk to the left, Cloud will have
another attack and you'll see the ghostly form of Sephiroth leaving the
Ancient City.  Once Cloud has recovered, follow Sephiroth by heading
north, then east along the path you couldn't take before.  Note that
you're free to go back through the Forest and return to the World Map,
but there's no point in doing so unless you wanted to buy some items or
find Vincent or Yuffie (unless you already have them).  Although you're
now on Disc 2, none of the other events that occur in this disc will
actually happen until you get the Highwind in section 4e (meaning that if
you were to return to the World Map, you couldn't go on the Huge materia
quests yet, dig up the Gate 5 Key, or bring Bugenhagen back to the
Ancient City).

In the next area, ignore the white, spiked object for a moment.  Instead,
walk behind it (look for a path to your left).  This will allow you to
reach a chest containing a Viper Halberd (a weapon for Cid).  Once
you've gotten it, climb up the spiky object.  It's a little tricky to
navigate due to it's spiraling shape, but you'll eventually reach a
cave entrace after making your way to the top.

Inside, walk to the left and press against the second cleft in the wall.
You'll climb to the top and be given two options (Right or Left).  Pick
the bottom option (Left).  Walk over to the next cleft and climb up it,
then choose the bottom option when you reach the top to land on a little
ledge with a chest above it.  You can open the chest from where you are;
there's a Bolt Armlet inside.  Face the cleft and choose the bottom
choice, then the top one to jump to the other side.  Now, go to the right
and when two options appear, pick the bottom one.  This lets you climb
down to where the first chest is; there's a HypnoCrown inside of it.
Climb back up to the top of the cleft, pick the bottom option, then press
against it to try and get back on.  When two options appear, choose the
top one.  Then, make your way up to the ledge with the chest, and pick
the top option.  You can now take the Megalixir from inside the chest.
Get back into the cleft and choose the bottom option to jump to the west
side of the path.  Work your way to the left, climb up the cleft, and
head left a second time to reach a long ladder.  Selecting the bottom
option will left you climb down to the bottom of the ladder.

If you search using the O button, you'll find a purple materia (Magic
Plus) near the lower-left corner of the screen.  When you approach the
ladder, you'll automatically climb up to the ledge you were at.  Now
pick the top option after nearing the ladder and climb all the way to
the top.  Once you're off the ladder, run to the right and go through
the opening on the north wall.  In the next room, take the contents of
the treasure chest (Power Source) before exiting through the far opening
to the northwest.

Once outside, keep to the east.  After heading along the coastline
for a while, you'll come across a sharp curve that turns to the west.
Just beyond it is a village and a deep valley, which you can't enter
without exploring the village (Icicle Inn) first.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.2  icicle inn / great glacier
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  X-Potion, Hero Drink, Vaccine, Turbo Ether, Mind
                     Source, Safety Bit, Elixir, Added Cut materia,

Go to the far end of town and talk to the man in purple standing near
the trees.  Pick the top option.  Two Shinra members will show up, along
with Elena (a Turk).  After confronting Cloud, she will try to knock him
out.  To avoid her strike, press left, right, or up just after you see
the transparent message box.  If she does hit you, you'll wake up in one
of the houses, but if she doesn't, then she'll roll right out of the
town.  It doesn't make a difference whether you get hit or not.

After that's done with, go to town entrance and check out the house
that's just to your right.  In the back room, there's a boy, a cat,
and a snowboard.  Talk to the boy and the cat will leave the room,
enabling you to take the snowboard by examining it.  You'll need it for
the upcoming event.  Now, go to the inn, head to the upper floor, and
examine the window in the lower left-hand corner to get an X-Potion.
You can also check out the bar beneath the main room (look for a door
near the reception area).  Now, leave and enter the house on the far
right (near the snowman).  Take the items in the back room (an Hero
Drink and a Vaccine), then examine the map on the wall in the main room.
You can examine it by choosing the top option, but before you leave,
you'll want to choose the bottom option to take it.

Finally, go into the house on the left side of town, just to the right
of the weapons shop.  If Elena KO'd you, this is where you'll wake
up :)  If you go down the stairs and look by the windowsill, you can
get another item (Turbo Ether).  You can also take a look at the
machinery on the ground floor to see a series of prerecorded videos
dating back many years ago; they show Aeris' mother (Ifalna, a Cetra
just like Aeris) and her father, a 'renegade' Shinra scientist named
Gast.  There are several videos, but watching them has no effect on the
game itself, aside from cluing you in to Aeris' past.  There's a device
to the left that will allow more light into the room, but it doesn't
have any purpose.

Before you leave the town, you may want to buy weapons, Hi-Potions
and Tents at the shop.  When you're ready to go, simply walk past the
man in the back of town (the one near the trees), and the snowboard
sequence will start up:

Your controls while using the snowboard are:

S               Brake
X               Jump
Pad             Move left or right, down to brake
Start           Pause/unpause
L1/R1           Quick turn to the left or right when used
                with control pad

Basically, you want to make your way through the mountains.  You can
collect balloons along the way, but I don't know what they do for you.
There are also obstacles to crash into, like dead wood, pine trees,
igloos, moogles, snowmen, rocks, ice boulders, and chocobos.  I believe
there are four different 'exit' paths; I'll take the left path twice
and go from there in this FAQ.

My characters came to in a white forest.  Did yours?  From this point
onward, you can press S to look at the map you took (but not in some
screens), which shows where you need to go but not where you are.  I
spent hours trying to map this place out, only to discover that there's
almost nothing of interest in this area.  So, I've simply described each
location and where it is on the map; getting there isn't much of a
problem.  Your ultimate goal, BTW, is to make it to the red check mark
shown on the map.

The locations are listed below (I'm using my names for the :

ENTRANCE  (looks like a square at the bottom-center of the screen)
Heading south from this area takes you back out to the World Map.  If
you return to Icicle Inn to heal yourself, you'll have to snowboard
in here again.

MOUNTAIN CAVE  (small opening just to the right of the ENTRANCE)
You can hop across the ledges to the top of the screen, but in the next
room, there's nothing to do but choose to fall/not fall down an icy
chute that has no effect aside from ejecting you back into the world
map.  The entrance to this cave is hard to see; it's in the lower-right
area of the T-junction screen.  You can also get here by going right
from the LAKE CAVE area.

FOREST  (forest divided by Y-shaped paths)
In the main forest screen, there's an item (Mind Source) at the foot of
a tree near the upper left part of the screen.  If this is where you
landed after the snowboarding event, then it's just up and to the right
of where you crashed.

BURIED AIRPLANE  (tail of plane sticking out to left of forest)
Nothing here.

LAKE CAVE  (cave in the middle of the central lake)
On the surface of the frozen lake, near the shore, there is a green
item (a Potion).  Be sure to get it.  Then head to the left to reach
a screen full of ice floes.  Here, you'll have to jump on the floating
ice chunks to get across, but the chunks surrounding the one you're
currently standing on will submerge or raise depending on how they
looked when you arrived there.  If you mess up and they are all
submerged, you'll have to start all over.  The key is to make sure that
you're not jumping onto a floe when the ones surrounding it are all
raised, or else they'll all submerge and you'll fall into the water.
To get on the ice floats, choose the top option, then use the O button
and the controller to jump around.  Enter the cave in the next area,
grab the item bag (it contains a Safety Bit accessory), and leave.

LONE TREE  (pine tree up and right from the LAKE CAVE)
Nothing here, either.

ICE BOULDERS  (northwest corner, left and below the STONE FACE)
Go into the small cave entrance and grab the item in the northwest
corner of the cavern (an Elixir), then go out the other entrance.

RIVER LOG  (above central lake, at mouth of river)
There's nothing here.

STONE FACE  (left of the red check mark)
Nothing here.  Seem familiar?  The stone face has also appeared in
Secret of Mana and FF5j.

STEAMING LAKES  (south and east of the check mark)
You can touch the water on the lefthand bank if you want.  In fact,
you should, since you can't get the Alexander Materia any other way.
(Keep reading for details.) Just maneuver yourself as close to the
shore of the left lake as you can, and when an option appears, pick
the top one.

MOUNTAIN CROSSROADS  (top of mountain east of the STEAMING LAKES)
Once you reach the crossroads (da dum da da :))  head to the upper
right corner of the screen to go off the map.  In the next area,
work your way up and to the left.  When this screen repeats a second
time, look for a Blue Materia (Added Cut) near the beginning
of the screen, in the upper-right part of the path.  This road takes
you to the Steaming Lakes area, but if you try to back the way you
came, you'll see that the screen has changed.  Put another way, you
couldn't have gotten the Materia unless you took this path since the
'switching' road isn't marked on the map.

If you're fast, you can reach the 'lost in the snowfield' section (the
red checkmark) before anything bad happens.  But if you waste your time
in this area, you'll pass out.  (This will still happen to you even if
you reached the snowfield, but then returned to any part of the 'first
area'.  If that happens, go to the next section.  If you made it to the
snowfield area, then skip the first paragraph to find out where you are.

Personally, my suggestion is that you follow the example in the FAQ
and take the left path twice so that you land in the Forest.  From
there, you can go right to the Lake Cave area, then continue right
past the Mountain Cave area (the T-junction), and up into the Mountain
Crossroads, where you can take the switching path to the Steaming
Lakes, and then head left into the snowfield.  Not only is this a
fast way to get through this area, but it also lets you pick up all
the items along the way and get the Alexander Materia later on (since
you touched the lake on your way out).

Also, you'll start off at the bottom end of the snowfield when you first
get there, so you can just head up to the cave to get the All materia
(mentioned in the next section), then keep heading north to reach the
old man's shack (if you're in need of healing and a Save Point).  After
talking with him, you can go to the Stone Face Area, head south to the
Ice Boulders area where an Elixir is, then backtrack to the snowfield
and go to the right in order to get the Alexander Materia before
returning to the shack.  Voila!  You've just cleared out this _entire_
area in only a few minutes!

Remember, you _will_ pass out eventually if you return to the first
area--there's nothing you can do about it, even if you've already
gone to Holzoff's shack.  If you don't want to waste too much time
backtracking just run around in the same few areas until it happens,
then leave the old man's shack and continue exploring.  Why this still
happens to you after clearing out this area doesn't seem to make much
sense, as it's more of a nuisance than anything else, but there's not
much you can do about it.  If you return to the first area after
falling unconscious and wait around there again, you'll pass out a
second time.  In fact, this will always happen to you, so get moving!

  4.3  lost in the snow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  All Materia, Circlet, Alexander Materia.

If you passed out:

You'll awake in the house of an old man named Holzoff.  Go up the stairs
and let the old man talk to you; choose the bottom option twice when he
asks you two questions.  When you wake up the next morning, check out the
Save Point (since you probably haven't saved prior to entering the Icicle
Inn).  If you want to spend the night again, talk to the old man in the
first room and choose the top choice.  When you leave the shack, your
friends will be waiting outside.  Make a new party if you wish, (see
below for directions) then head south.  You may have noticed that you can
talk to Holzoff from the ground floor even though he is above you :)

If you didn't pass out:

Go directly through the snowy field to the shack (head north) so that you
won't pass out.  There, you'll meet an old hermit named Holzoff.  Talk to
him, and when he asks you a question, answer any way you like.  The
second time he asks you a question, choose the bottom reply.  You'll
spend the night at his shack, and when you leave the next morning, your
allies will be standing around outside.  Choose either choice when an
option appears.  Then talk to any member and pick the top option to
accept a party change or the bottom option to decline, if you want to
change your members.

If you don't want to explore the snowfield any more, skip to section 4.4.
After all, you can return here at any future point in the game, providing
you have the Highwind.  Otherwise, head south to leave the shack area.

Outside, you'll be in a large snowfield.  Use the O button to set down
spikes that you can use to track your location (since your direction
changes when the wind picks up).  If you want to explore the rest of
that first area that you left/passed out in, head south.  When you leave
the first area from the Steaming Lakes exit, you'll see a rock formation
with a cave entrance if you keep walking north.  Inside, a Blue Materia
(All) is lying near the tent.

If you head east, you'll go through some snowy areas, then arrive at a
cave entrance.  Talk to the purple lady inside to enter a battle, but
only if you touched the water back at the Steaming Lakes.

You can't Control or Morph her, but you can steal a Circlet during the
battle.  Her cold-based attacks (Cold Breath and Ice 2) are nothing to
worry about, but be careful if she Fascinates (charms) one of your own
members.
3_________________________________________________________________________

If you are victorious, she'll disappear and a Summon Materia (Alexander)
will drop to the floor, so don't miss it.  While you can use the map
here, you can't reach this place normally from the first area.  If you go
right, then down the snowy path, you'll end up at the 'switching'
crossroads in the first area, though (sort of like a one-way path).

Going west from the snowfield takes you to an alternate entrance to the
first area.  There's not that much to do there, anyway, unless you want
a shortcut to the ICE BOULDERS area where an item is lying in a cave
(refer to the previous section for more information).

If you're really having trouble navigating around, think of the
snowfield like this:

                 First Area (Steaming Lakes)

So no matter how far you are along a boundary, you'll still enter that
area when you hit it.  The same applies to the corners -- you'll hit
one boundary or the other, so going in a diagonal direction won't get
you to a new place.  Don't worry about finding an 'exact' spot to enter
an area, just head in that direction.  The only real landmark is the
cave with the All materia, but if you head north from the
Steaming Lakes exit, you're bound to spot it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.4  the crater / whirlwind maze
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Ribbon, Javelin, Elixir, Fire Armlet, Megalixir,
                    Speed Source, Enhance Sword, Dragon Fang, Neo Bahamut
                    materia, Ether, Hi-Potion, Kaiser Knuckle, Reflect
                    Ring, MP Turbo materia, Poison Ring.

Once you've had your fun in the snowfield, return to the old man's
house and heal up or save your game if you need to.  Then, go north
from the shack to arrive at the slopes of a icy mountain.  Keep in
mind that you can't explore this area at any time other than right
now in Disc 2, so make sure to get all the items and other stuff.

Now, get ready for some finger-smashing fun!  The meter that appears on
screen when you're outside is your body temperature: it goes down because
of the cold climate.  To keep your temperature up, you need to rapidly
hit the S button.  The highest temperature you can get to is 38, while
the lowest is 27.  Any less than that (26), and you pass out and find
yourself back in Holzoff's shack.  It sounds like keeping your heat
up is easy, but you can only increase it when you're on one of the
ledges, not while you're climbing up the rock face.  So for those long
climbs, you have to max out your heat and climb as quickly as you can.
Luckily, your heat doesn't go down during a battle. Remember, it's not
how hard you press the S button, but how fast you press it, so try to
get in as many presses as you can to max out your temperature.

I had made a GameShark code for this part of the game in the Japanese
version of FF7, because it was so hard.  But in the US version, you'd
have to really mess up to have your temperature dip below 34, even.
That's right, here's another example of Square making an easier game
even simpler.  In the Japanese version, you _destroyed_ your fingers
trying to keep your rapidly-decreasing body heat up. ^_^;

In this area, there's nowhere else to go but up, so climb along the
rock face until you arrive at the cave entrance, pausing at each ledge
to restore your body heat.  Always keep an eye out for the red flags;
they indicate which part of the wall you can climb.  Inside, go through
the two archways into the next cavern.  Here, climb up the stairs and
go through the south exit.  In the adjoining area, walk all the way to
the right to find a hidden chamber with a chest; inside it is a Ribbon.
Then return to the main path and head north, then west, through the
entrance.  Cross the icy bridge in the third cavern and press the
SELECT button to bring up the cursor; it'll help you navigate through
the twisting passage before you.  Once you reach the top, examine the
boulder and choose the top option when it presents itself.  This will
make you push the boulder and free up the blocked passage beneath you.
You can still move while the boulder is rolling--notice that you can
stand right where it falls and you will recieve no damage (then again,
Cloud is the same guy who can run around in the cold wearing a
sleeveless shirt and not die of hypothermia...must be those corn
flakes).

Go back to the other room (where you got the Ribbon), and open the
purple chest to the northeast; there's a Javelin lying inside it.  Now,
return to the room that you exited from the south (the one with the
formerly blocked passage), and go north along the passage until you
reach another exit.  This leads to the upper path above the chest with
the Javelin--keep following it and you'll find yourself outside.

Build up your temperature, then climb up the wall.  After going a short
distance, you're given a choice (up, down, or right).  Pick the top
option (up), and head up until you reach a ledge.  Keep climbing upward,
and you'll be prompted with another choice (right or down).  Pick the
top option and head right to arrive at another ledge.  Then climb up
until you reach the next ledge; it has a path going left and an
unmarked path that goes to the right (i.e. there's no flag by it).  The
right path is a dead end, so take the left path and keep climbing up
along the wall (you'll find another ledge on the way) until you reach a
second cave entrace.

This large cavern is pocked with holes.  There's an exit and a treasure
chest, but they are too high to reach, at the moment.  Don't miss the
Save Point between the chest and the exit.  Nab the other chest in the
lower right corner of the room (there's an Elixir inside of it), then go
north from the chest to find a passage that leads outside.   Once you're
out in the open again, head north, then go around the bend and head
south and east.

In the next room, examine the area immediately to the right to find a
chest with an Fire Armlet inside.  There are four huge icicles
here that you need to knock into the holes in the lower cavern.  This is
done by 'fighting' them.  Each icicle is guarded by several yellow bats.

_________________________________________________________________________
TIPS:  ICICLE                                   LV: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 300
                                  (weak against Fire, Earth, and Gravity)
       EVILHEAD                                   LV: 28  HP: 740  MP: 45

The Icicle can counter with an Icicle Drop attack.  It will do this to
any person who attacks it, tries to steal from it, or the like.  You
don't have to kill the bats in order to win the battle (all you have to
do is 'kill' the icicle), but since they can Silence your characters and
recover HP when they attack you, you may want to get them out of the way
before attacking the icicle.  Or, use Beta to inflict damage on all of
them at once.  Killing the icicle is worth 500 exp, 0 AP, and 0 gil, so
if you want some AP and gil, you may want to kill the Evilheads too
(which, incidentally, you can Morph into Holy Torches).
_________________________________________________________________________

Each time you win a battle, you'll be given an option.  If you pick the
bottom choice, you'll drop down to the room below, while picking the top
choice lets you stay where you are (so you can continue to 'fight' the
other icicles.  After knocking down the last icicle, choose to stay
where you are so that you can get the chest on the far left (it has a
Megalixir inside*).  Then, go back along the path.  Just before you
reach the door, an option appears; pick the bottom choice to jump down
to the room below.

 *  Note that it says you get a 'Last Elixir'!  Yes, this is the power
    of the Square translators at work.  'Last Elixir' was the Japanese
    name of the Megalixir item, and if you look at your menu, you will
    have gotten an extra Megalixir, not a new item called 'Last Elixir'.
    Didn't they do a good job on the translation? :)

When the icicles drop down here, the floor of the cavern is 'raised'.
After knocking down 3 of them, you can reach the exit, knock down all
4 and you can get the chest on the ledge in the upper left corner of
the room (which contains a Speed Source).  When you're ready, go through
the now-avalible exit by hopping across the stones.  This leads to the
left side of the outer path.  Be sure to examine the chest that's here
to get an Enhance Sword, then follow the path as it curves back on
itself and leads to the lower passage in the icicle room.

Keep following the path, and you'll find yourself on the side of the
mountain yet again.  Grab the rock face and climb to the right.  After a
while, three options will appear (up, left, or right).  Pick the bottom
choice and keep holding right to make Cloud ascend the side of the
mountain.  When you reach the next ledge, raise your temperature and take
the path that leads to the left.  As you're climbing, another set of
options will appear (up, down, or right). Choose the top option and keep
climbing up.  Once you've made it beyond the second ledge, you'll find a
final cave entrance.

This area has a hard-to-miss Save Point in it, and if you examine the
nearby pool of light, your HP and MP will be completely restored, and
all dead characters will be revived.  Now is a perfect time to stock
up on goodies--you can use the pool to stay healthy while fighting the
enemies for exp, AP, and gil, and you can learn Smelly Breath from the
Molbors just outside (be sure to wear a Ribbon!)  Plus, you can win
Dragon Armlets from the Blue Dragons in this cave, which will halve
damage taken from Fire, Cold, or Lightning attacks, and win M-Tentacles
from defeated Molbols.  There's a boss encounter coming your way, so make
sure you're ready to do battle, then exit the chamber by going to the far
right.

In the adjoining hallway, you'll see one of those shrouded creatures
(similar to the ones in Nibelheim) be thrown to the floor.  Before you
have a chance to examine it, you'll be attacked by a two-headed boss.

In case you're confused, the 'right head' is the scaly one, and the 'left
head' is the one with horns.  Anyway, you should have the Aurora, Bolt,
and Fire Armlets equipped on your members to reduce damage from the scaly
head's Fire breath and the horned head's Ice breath.  The Bolt Armlet
will defend you against the heads' final attack, which damages all
members for 1400 damage.  Use MBarrier to up your defense, then Haste
yourselves.  Try using Earth and Comet spells, as well and summonings,
like Alexander, Leviathan, and Bahamut to soften the boss up.  However,
don't use Poison (which does no damage) or the Kjata summon spell (which
will heal both heads).  Ice works well on the scaly head, and Fire works
well on the horned head, but don't confuse the two since you will heal a
head instead of hurt it. You may also want to use Elemental and attack a
Fire or Ice materia attached to your weapon in order to attack with that
sort of element (but don't attack the other head, for the same reason).
In addition to breath attacks, the boss can also use a dual Ice/Fire
breath attack, it can cast Quake 3, and has the previously mentioned
final attack that it uses once when each head dies (and if you kill both
heads at once, you'll still lose if both final attacks kill you off.
When it's defeated, you'll get a Dragon Fang from the boss.
_________________________________________________________________________

If you were badly beaten during the fight, you can always return to the
room with the pool to heal yourselves.  Otherwise, continue down the
passage; it leads outside (Cloud sure moves slow out here, doesn't he?)
Then climb the icy wall up to the top, where an automatic sequence will
play.  After it finishes, head along the side of the inner crater.  In
the next area, Tifa will talk with you if she's in your party; if she
isn't, she'll promptly appear and insist on coming with you, which
means you'll have to kick a member out of your current group.  Head
to the left.

In the next area, climb down to the lower path and look for a red materia
(Neo Bahamut) near the bottom edge of the screen.  You can't do
anything about the shrouded guy leaping off-screen, so ignore him.  After
getting the materia, you can hop up to a small island of rock where there
is a Save Point.  When you're done there, jump again to return to the
top path, and walk to the left.  You'll see a short intermission with
the three heads of Shinra and several scientists heading towards the
Crater in the Highwind, the airship you saw back in Junon Town.

Once the intermission is over, walk left and you'll reach the first of
three 'shield' screens.  Talk to the two shrouded men, and they'll
each leave behind an item when they die (an Ether and a Hi-Potion).
To get past the flickering shield that's in front of you, stand as close
to it as you can, then wait until the green aura is almost gone.  Now,
quickly run through it or you'll be knocked back when the shield's aura
grows stronger.  If you mess up, you'll be repelled by the shield and
will be attacked by a monster:

TIPS:  WIND WING                                LV: 36  HP: 1900  MP: 350

For starters, you can steal a Hi-Potion from the Wind Wing, and you can
transform it into a Phoenix Down.  Even better, you can control it using
a Manipulate materia and make it attack itself!  In other words, this is
an easy battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

If you happen to touch the shield from the other side, you'll get knocked
back to the front of the screen, so be careful.

In the next screen, more of those shrouded creatures are running around
and dying.  Ignore them, but don't miss the chest near the first left
turn of the path; there's a Kaiser Knuckle inside it.  Follow the path
until you reach the next screen.  The second shield is here, but unlike
the first one, there's a surge of energy traveling along the shield
that will knock you back even if the shield's aura is almost gone.  So,
wait until the energy surge has passed _and_ the aura is nearly
invisible, then dash across.  If either defense knocks you back, you'll
have to fight a second Wind Wing (see the above strategy).

Beyond the shield, Sephiroth awaits.  He'll cut down two more of those
black creatures before turning invisible and toying around with Cloud.
After he attacks the party, he'll summon a second version of Jenova to
kill Cloud and his friends.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: JENOVA*DEATH                         LV: 55  HP: 25000  MP:800

Jenova will try to Silence your members from time to time, and uses a
Red Light attack often (usually after being attacked with magic).  It
causes little damage, but too many of these will really mess up your
party.  Jenova's last form of attack is a spurt of fire bubbles (even
weaker than the Red Light attack).  As you can see, this battle is not
hard at all; just hack away with physical attacks, or if you think you
have enough HPs, use Comet and cast Bahamut, Neo Bahamut, and Alexander.
It's advisable that you wear the Fire Armlet or Dragon Armlet, since
Jenova's attacks all cause Fire-based damage.  Give the Fire Armlet to
your best spell caster, and you can knock out Jenova and gain life back
at the same time :)  You'll win a Reflect Ring when the battle's over.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the boss is killed, you'll get the Black Materia back (and it's
actually black this time :))  Once you're back in control of Cloud,
he confesses that since Sephiroth was able to manipulate him last time,
he might try it again.  Therefore, someone else should hold the Black
Materia and stay here while Cloud and the others follow after Sephiroth.
The first time I got here, only Red 13 would take the Black Materia.
This second time, only Barret would.  In the US game, they both offered
to keep it...! ^_^;  Well, just give it to whoever will take it--simply
choose the top option when it is available (you won't get an option if
that character refuses to take it).  Finally, talk to Tifa.

When you're in control of Cloud again, head north.  There's a materia
here (MP Turbo, but notice that it's yellow when you pick it up!), as
well as a Save Point and a chest containing a Poison Ring.  If you go
north from here, you'll run into the third and final shield.   In
addition to having all the defenses of the previous shield (the glowing
aura and the moving energy surge), bolts of lightning will strike the
ground repeatedly.  Since the lightning strikes in short bursts with
long pauses in between, wait for the shield's aura to fade, the energy
surge to pass, _and_ wait for a pause in the lightning strikes before
attempting to pass through the shield.  If you're hit by any one of
those defenses, you'll have to fight a Wind Wing again (refer to the
strategy section above).  Once you're past the shield, head along the
path.  It leads to an exact replicate of Nibelheim.

This next scene is sorta like a 'semi-interactive' flashback.  You get
to see Sephiroth run around in Nibelheim, but this time, there's another
guy following him (Zack, the guy you heard about in Gongaga Village).
Talk to your other party member, then to Tifa.  In the next scene,
Zack will look around Nibelheim (which has been reduced to smoldering
rubble), and chat with Zangan, who was Tifa's mentor.  (BTW, you can go
to the Main Menu while Zack is running around.  It's pointless, but I
thought it was sort of amusing :))  Then, your party appears in a flaming
building, and Sephiroth appears.  Instead of attacking, he talks to the
party.  When you can move, talk to Sephiroth and he'll teleport around
the room.  When you're in control of Cloud once more, talk to Tifa twice.
Sephiroth warps around some more, then shows Cloud a picture of him,
Tifa, and Zack.  After that, Cloud has another fit, and the screen fades
out.

In the next scene, Rufus, Scarlet, and Hojo (the scientist) arrive at the
crater.  Before them is a monster encased in ice.  It's one of the five
'Weapons', which awakens and watches them, then starts moving.  Following
that, Sephiroth appears in the guise of Tifa and knocks out the other
characters, then tricks whoever is guarding the Black Materia to go to
the center of the crater.  Your party will appear in the area where the
Shinra members are at, and the person with the Black Materia gives it to
Cloud, who then flies to the structure where Sephiroth is at (though you
can move around up here, the game takes over your controls in a few
seconds anyway).  Once Cloud's given the Black Materia to Sephiroth, the
whole crater starts to break apart and your party (sans Cloud) escapes on
the Highwind along with the rest of the Shinra crew.  Notice that the
FMV will suddenly switch to the five Weapon monsters escaping; this is
new to the US version of Final Fantasy.  The remaning FMV has also been
altered (five streaks of light representing the Weapons shoot out of the
crater).  Gee, I dunno, I kinda liked the Japanese FMV better (really!)

  4.5  junon town attacked!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Enemy Skill materia, Chocobo Lure materia, Fourth
                    Bracelet, Yoshiyuki (if you didn't get it the first
                    time).  Note that none of these items are actually
                    found in Junon Town, but since I talk about them in
                    this section, they're listed here.

When you come to, you'll find yourself incarcerated back in Junon Town.
Without Cloud, you'll be taking control of Barret and Tifa for most of
this section.  As Tifa, talk to Barret.  Rufus and Heidegger will show
up.  Now that you're in control of Barret, follow Tifa as the guards take
her away (don't miss the Save Point), and prepare to execute her.  Once
Junon Town is attacked by the freed Weapon, one of the Shinra officials
knocks out Scarlet.  It's turns out to be none other than Cait Sith,
who helps Barret fight the two soldiers who are guarding him.  Why not
make use of the new 'Exchange' materia option to fully equip Cait Sith
before he joins you? :)

_________________________________________________________________________
TIPS:  SOLDIER:1st  (is this the correct name?) LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100
       SOLDIER:1st                              LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100

Physical attacks will do the trick here, although you can control them
if you want.  If this battle gives you trouble, you need to gain some
levels at some point in the game.
_________________________________________________________________________

Notice how the guard will run away and disappear after the battle?  I
guess that glitch went unnoticed...anyway, examine the door in the lower
right corner of the screen and use the controller or the O button to make
Barret try to pull it open.  An FMV sequence follows in which the Sister
Ray (the mako cannon) is readied and Junon Town prepares to engage the
approaching Weapon.  When it collides with the city, gas starts pumping
into the chamber Tifa is trapped in.  When you're in control of Barret,
go and talk to Cait Sith.  Then go out the door and when it closes, head
right, then out the door.  Outside, head down the road.  If you got
Yuffie, she'll be here masquerading as a newscaster; talk to her to make
her join you, then continue to your left.  Once the Weapon rises out of
the water, continue to the left until you arrive at the Airport.  Then,
run to the center platform and examine the yellow box to be lifted to the
upper level.  From there, continue towards the airship by heading right.

When you're in control of Tifa again, you have to pick up the key on
the ground so you can free yourself from the gas chamber.  Your
controls are:

S       Move right arm
X       Move feet
O       Move left arm
T       Move Tifa's head

You'll need to press the buttons in this order:  X, X, T, X+T, T+O, O.
(Or, press X, X, T, X+T, T+S, S if you want to free her other hand
instead...it makes no difference).

Pressing them has the following effect:

When you press X, Tifa will stretch out her legs.  Pressing X a second
time makes her drag the key towards her.  Then press T to sit back in
the chair.  Then press T and X at the same time (you don't need to hold
them, just press them), and she'll lift the key up with her feet and
take hold of it with her teeth at the same time.  After that, T+O
together will make her free her arm using the key.  Finally, press O
so that she can grab the key and use it to release her other arm.

Feel free to take your time doing this since waiting around won't do
anything to you (Tifa's invincible!  Mwa, ha ha!!)

Examine the back of the room by the left side of the chair to shut off
the gas, then examine the door.  After the Weapon provides you with
an exit, climb outside and work your way down the front of the tower
(don't worry about the guards).  When you reach the bottom, head toward
the upper left corner of the screen (note that the SELECT cursor won't
appear over your head as it did in the Japanese version).  In the next
screen, make your way down to the frontmost cylinder of the cannon
(spelled 'Canon'!), then press up to go along the front of it and end up
on the cannon barrel itself (this can be a little tricky).  Just as you
reach the edge of the cannon, Scarlet.  She'll start slapping you, so
press the O button to slap back (go Tifa, go)!  If you're fast enough,
you'll slap her to the floor after 5-6 good hits.  If she gets in more
slaps, you get knocked over.  Despite the outcome of the 'fight', Tifa
will still be rescued by Barret in the Highwind.

Once in the airship, head to the cockpit where you'll talk with Cid.
When he finishes, talk to Red 13 and Cid again, then chat with the man
piloting the airship.  After that, go to the room marked 'Operations'
and talk to the man there.  He will let you assemble a new group with
Tifa as the leader.  From this point onward, you can return to this room
and talk with the man to activate PHS, restore your HP and MP, or save
your game.  Now that you have a party, return to the cockpit and talk to
the man again.  Choose the top option, and you can control the Highwind!
To pilot it, use these controls:

S       When held, you can use the Pad to fly without changing the
        direction you're facing
X       Press to land
O       Move the Highwind in the direction you're facing
T       Takes you inside the Highwind
Pad     Press left/right to turn, up/down to rise or descend
Start   Reveals/enlarges/hides the map
Select  Same as Start

Notice that your other vehicles (the Buggy and Cid's airplane) are gone
for good.  BTW, you enter the Highwind by pressing O when you're close
to it (like other vehicles).  To gain control of it again, just talk to
the man at the wheel and pick the top option.  At this point, you'll
probably want to look around and go to various places.  However, you can
only land on _green, grassy_ ground, and nowhere else, which limits the
areas you can explore (this doesn't include the canyon floor on the
Northern Continent).  There are two areas you can now reach with the
Highwind.  The first one is a cave with a sleeping man that's just
beyond the mountain range near Midgar City (you can go here with the
Buggy, but since you no longer have it, you'll have to use the Highwind).
Also, there's a house to the east of Icicle Inn, you can talk to the
green Chocobo inside to get a free Enemy Skill Materia, and the purple
geezer who lives here (Chocobo Sage) will sell you various chocobo foods.
Finally, if you return to the Chocobo Farm, you'll find a purple materia
(Chocobo Lure) near the edge of the now-empty Chocobo pen.  From now on,
you can breed Chocobos here (refer to the 'Secrets and Strategies'
section for details).

If you look, there's a lake near Junon now (I thought this didn't
appear until Disc 3 *sheepish grin*)  There's also a barrier
surrounding the Crater, and of course, a huge meteor is hanging in the
sky (the result of Sephiroth casting Meteo via the Black Materia).  A
lot of places now sell different items, among them Junon Town*, Fort
Condor, Costa Del Sol, and Rocket Town.  There's also some new treasure
to be found in Rocket Town: there's a chest with a Fourth Bracelet in
the store that sells accessories, in the back of the adjoining room.
And if you didn't get the Yoshiyuki from the old man in Disc 1, you can
get it now.

 * In very last area of Junon, there's a man standing out in the middle
   of the road.  If you talk to him and choose the bottom option,
   nothing happens.  But if you choose the top option, the Shinra
   helicopter lands and you're given another choice.  Pick the top option
   and you can ride it back to the first area of Junon Town!  If you
   choose the bottom option, you'll be flown back out to the World Map.

Finally, keep in mind that there are some things that Tifa can't do,
like enter the Gold Saucer or play the piano in her house in Nibelheim.
Ditto with Cid, who becomes the leader during the next section (keep
reading).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.6  where's cloud? / north corel express
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Curse Ring, Elixir, Contain materia, Ultima materia,
                     Catastrophe manual.

Get in the Highwind and fly to the Southern Continent.  Look around until
you spot a forest with a small village nearby.  Land in the grass, and
enter the village, Mideel.  Look around, and be sure to do some shopping;
the items here are expensive, but well worth your money.  When you're
done, go to the weapon shop and examine the door in the back of the room.
You will try to knock on it.  Go outside and climb up the stairs, then
walk along the floorboards behind the house where you can buy
accessories.   You should hear a sound.  If you press O to examine the
floor, you'll receive a key.  Return to the weapon shop and examine the
door in the back again.  When an option appears, select the top choice.
You'll mess around with the door.  When the shopkeeper asks what's going
on, pick the bottom option, and he'll give you the Curse Ring accessory.
(If you want to see your character act funny, pick the top option
instead--works better with Tifa than with anyone else, IMO.  Of course,
you'll have to reset and try again if you want the Curse Ring.)

There's a hyperactive kid running around here, buying everything.  Make
sure you talk to the kid in every store (see the price listing for
Mideel if you want to know why).  If you have some Mimett Greens on
you, you can feed the kid's white chocobo (your character says that it
wants 'Samolen Greens', but they really mean 'Mimett Greens'.  More
fun from the Square translators, no doubt!)  Feed the chocobo a Mimett
Green, then choose to scratch behind it's ear and you'll get the Contain
materia.

When you try to explore the north end of the town, Tifa automatically
goes over to the cat in the middle of the screen.  While playing with
it she hears that a strange man has been brought to the hospital--inside
is none other than Cloud, who survived the blast of energy back at the
Crater.  However, he's nothing more than a vegetable now.  Tifa insists
on staying by his side.  Back at the Highwind, Cait Sith reveals that
the Shinra are hunting for the four Huge Materia, which they plan to
use in order to destroy the Meteor before it crashes into the Earth.
Barret gets distressed when he learns that the Shinra plan to destroy
to get the Huge Materia from North Corel then Cid becomes the new party
leader!  Despite his dorky running style, Cid makes a good front man.
Once you're able to control him, go to the Operations room and make a
new team.

Before you go anywhere else, land and return to Mideel.  You can now
check out the house in the middle of the town, where an old man sits
betting his cat.  There's a large green item on the man's bed (an
Elixir).  If you try to leave, the cat turns out to be a ferocious
dog!  When an option appears, pick the top one to admit that you took
the Elixir.  However, the man will let you keep it.  On the other hand,
if you pick the bottom option, Cid will feign innocence, until the old
man tells him that the Elixir was rotten (it's not).  Either way, you
still get the item.  There's nothing else to do here (at least for now,
anyways), so leave the town behind and board the Highwind.

At this point in the game, two of the four Huge Materia sub-quests are
available to you: you can either get the Huge Materia in North Corel,
or get the one at Fort Condor.  The choice is yours.  If you want the
one in North Corel first, keep reading.  If you'd rather pick up the
one at Fort Condor first, skip to section 4.7 below.  Remember, you
DON'T have to succeed at Huge Materia Quests; in fact, you can lose all
four and still proceed with the game (if you decide to do this, just
ignore any mention of Huge Materia for the remainder of the FAQ).

Please refer to Section 8 to discover which Materia you will get
from which location before continuing, please!

Ready to go?  The next thing you have to do is stop a train from moving
the Huge Materia out of the Corel reactor.  You can pilot the Highwind to
two places; North Corel, and then work your way back through the old
train tracks to the Makoro furnace, or you can land at the nearby
cave-like entrance that leads to the furnace and take the train from
there.  Either way, you'll still have to do a bit of walking, so it's up
to you (check out section 3.14 if you don't remember what I'm talking
about).  Anyway, once you reach the furnace, head to the center and
you'll be attacked by some Shinra guards (easy to defeat).  After you
do them in, a train will leave the furnace.  What you have to do is
catch up with it before it leaves the Corel mountains.  The next scene
finds you and your companions on a train trying to catch up to the
Shinra train.

Remember the digit-damaging fun you had back at Gaea's Cliff?  Well, this
time, it's worse.  You have to press Up and the T button in a steady,
yet _extremely_ fast motion to make Cid pull the levers of the train so
that you can catch up to the Shinra train.  Even worse, there's a time
limit--you have to reach the train, board it, kill the enemies on board,
and stop it all within 10 minutes.  If you practice, you should be able
to catch up to the train in about 23-30 seconds, but remember that
you'll need about 4 minutes, at best, to beat the enemies on board, so
work quickly.  You fight monsters each time you leap to a new train car,
(five battles in all) and while they're relatively easy to win, they do
take up your time (the enemies are: Gas Doctor, Gas Doctor x2,
Wolfmeister, Eagle Gun, Attack Squad).  If you have learned it by now,
Remove can be used in the first two battles for a quick win.  If you're
low on time, don't use Summon Materia because the counter still
decreases during the casting (which usually takes some time).

Assuming you get to the locomotive with time remaining, wait for the
conversation between Cid and your other characters to stop.  You can
now do the following; press up + T to slow the train, or down + X to
speed it up.  Once Cid grabs the controls, press:

                Up + Triangle, Down + X, Down + X
                or: Down + X, Down + X, Down + X
                or: Up + Triangle, Down + X, Down + Triangle

    (if there are more commands then these, let me know, pls)

You can't enter either command while your buddies are talking to you,
so skip through the conversations when they occur.  The train will
speed up, but will slow just as it reaches the town, if you've done it
correctly.

There are three outcomes to this event:

 - If you never made it onto the Shinra train, you'll arrive at Corel
   and will not get the Huge Materia, nor will you get the Ultima
   materia.

 - If you made it onto the Shinra train, it goes out of control and
   crashes into North Corel.  You won't get the Huge Materia, but you
   can buy the Ultima Materia from a little kid for 50000 gil.

 - If you made it onto the Shinra train and stopped it, Corel won't
   be demolished.  You'll get the Huge Materia and will be given the
   Ultima materia for free, as a reward from the kid.

In any case, go to the house below the inn and a lady in a hat will give
you Barret's Level 4 Limit Break Manual.  Remember, it's really in your
best interest to save the town and get the Huge Materia.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.7  fort condor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Phoenix materia.

(Remember, you can do this before or after the North Corel Huge Materia
quest; it's your choice).

Pop into the Highwind and fly back to the blue tower with the big gold
bird on it (read section 3.12 if you don't remember where it was).
Enter it, and climb to the top of the tower.  Talk to the man in the
room with the locked door.  Choose the middle option, and you'll get to
control another mini-battle.  For instructions/strategies, please refer
to the 'Having Fun' bit in section 7.6.

When you win, you can open the sealed door.  On the rooftop is a red
materia (Phoenix), and if you talk to the man in white wearing the large
hat in the lower room, you get a Huge Materia.  For a condor's baby,
that bird sure looks like a Chocobo if you ask me....

If you fail the mini-battle, you're kicked out of Fort Condor and can
_never return_.  You can't get the Huge Materia or the Phoenix materia,
either.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.8  inside cloud's head
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head back to the village on the Southern Continent where you left Tifa
and Cloud behind (Mideel).  When you talk to Tifa, the screen will start
to shake.  Go outside, and you'll be attacked by a huge black dragon,
the second of four Weapons.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: ULTIMATE WEAPON                      LV: ??  HP: 10000  MP:400

This boss has only three attacks, Quake 2, the Ultima Beam, and a claw
swipe.  He's pretty easy to beat, so just keep summoning your best
monsters and use physical attacks to deal out damage.  After you've
injured it enough or it runs out of MP (use Magic Hammer on it), it will
fly away.  You can absorb Ultima Beam attacks by equipping the Elemental
materia plus any non-element materia, like Transform, Exit, etc.
_________________________________________________________________________

The next scene with Tifa and Cloud is so funny!  They're puffy and
superdeformed, and well let's just say any sense of danger or
surprise at this sudden attack is forgotten once you see their wide-
eyed faces as they escape the crumbling village.

After Tifa and Cloud take a dive, you'll find yourself playing with
Tifa, who's in a strange world filled with Cloud's memories.  First,
talk to the northmost Cloud.  You'll head into his memories of the
trip he took to that one town near the Jenova plant with Sephiroth.
When Cloud shows up, speak to him again.  When you reach the 'center'
of Cloud's mind again, speak to the Cloud on the left.  Once you're in
control of Tifa, converse with the Cloud sitting on the steps to the
right (near the 'kid' Cloud).

Then talk to the 'kid' Cloud and look in the window.  When you can
move Tifa, talk to the 'shadow' Cloud.  Once you're back in Cloud's
mind talk  to the 'real' Cloud and go back to the town area again.
Everything else unfolds by itself (you can go to the Main Menu during
the burning of Nibelheim--again!)  At the end, speak with Cloud one
last time, and you'll return to the 'real' world.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.9  100 leagues under the sea
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Contain materia (if you didn't get it already),
                     Guide Book, God's Hand, Battle Trumpet, Scimitar,
                     Leviathan Scales (it's a Key Item, but since you
                     don't have to get it, I'm listing it up here.)

Back at the airship, prepare a new team and take control of the Highwind.
You can buy goods that weren't available before back in Mideel, and
you'll want to get the Contain materia orb at some point.  To get it,
climb up the slope on the west side of town to where the hyperactive kid
is running around.  If you didn't get the Contain materia in Mideel the
first time, then, talk to his White Chocobo and pick the first option
(make sure you have at least one Mimett Green on you).  When a list of
six options appear, pick the fifth one from the top ("scratch behind it's
ears").  The chocobo will then reveal the Contain materia, which you can
take.

Furthermore, if you went into each store in Mideel and talked to the
hyperactive kid in each one, he will now be selling all the items that
you could normally buy there!  However, if you didn't go into any of
the shops, or only talked to him in one shop or two shops, then he will
only be selling items from those stores or will be selling nothing at
all.

Also, at this point in the game, the man who lost his keys will appear
outside Midgar City, enabling you to get the Sector 5 Key, among other
things.  You might want to take some time now to breed Chocobos, do some
shopping, or maybe have some fun at the Gold Saucer (since you can now
get in with Cloud in your party).

Also, there is an extra scene new to the US release--return to
Nibelheim and go down into the library in the Shinra Mansion.  Examine
the tanks in the back of the room for a flashback.

Whenever you're ready to proceed with the game, head to Junon Town for
the third Huge Materia quest (you can't do the fourth one until later).
Head into the center of Junon, and go down the main road (you'll see a
scene with Cloud inspecting the damage that the Weapon inflicted on the
town earlier).  Keep walking until you arrive at the gray underpassage
where a commander is drilling his men.  He will order his men to run
away when he sees you.  Continue down the passage until you see a door
labeled '1' against the left wall.  Enter it, and you'll find yourself
in an elevator.  Two guards in here will attack you; dispatch them and
let the lady take you down to the bottom of the elevator shaft.

When you step out, you'll be attacked by more Shinra soldiers.  Ignore
the dog and go down the slope, then through the door.  In the next room,
head down the set of stairs until you reach another door.  Past it is
yet another set of stairs, and at the bottom is a Save Point.  Go through
the door here to reach a second lift which takes you to the bottom of
the sea floor.  The area is shaped like a huge glass tube.  If you go
north to the second screen (in front of the Mako reactor), and fight
enemies, you'll eventually meet up with the Ghost Ship.  'Morph' it into
the Guide Book; you'll need that item later.

Head north until you reach the underwater tunnel, and follow it until you
arrive at the Mako plant.  Inside, examine the red light on the far wall
to pump water out of the chamber.  Step outside and you'll find yourself
in a huge undersea dock where several submarines are sitting.  Go along
the walkway--it leads to a hall with a Save Point.  Walk north from here
to arrive at a room filled with guards.

If you talk to the guard who's walking around, he'll attack you.  You'll
then fight the two other guards by the opening in a second battle.  If
you don't talk to the walking guard, then all three will ambush you.
However, if you let yourself get ambushed, you won't have to fight the
second set of soldiers by the other opening.  Decide what you want to do
(fun, isn't it?) and fight the guards accordingly.  Then go through the
opening to your right to find a chamber full of machinery.  Cloud will
automatically stop in front of one of the machines as you walk past it.
When you can control him again, head to the right to see the Red Huge
Materia being loaded onto a Shinra submarine.  Reno of the Turks is
here, and he'll summon a mechanical freak to take you out while he makes
a hasty retreat.

BOSS TIPS: CARRY ARMOR                        LV: 45  HP: 24000  MP: 200
           LEFT ARM                           LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 100
           RIGHT ARM                          LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 200
                                              (all weak vs. lightning)

This boss is composed of three parts.  It can imprison two of your
characters in his arms, and they recieve 1/3 the amount of damage that
it receives from your attacks.  However, since it has three parts, if
you're making an attack that hits more than once, your ally gets struck
twice or even three times!  Furthermore, if the third character is
killed while the other two are imprisoned, the battle is instantly lost.
Destroying it's arms should be your top priority, but the arms rotate
and switch sides when they are hit, so adjust your attacks accordingly.
Summoning spells and enemy skills work well here.  The boss' attacks are
not so strong, but they come quickly.  The worst one is the Lapis Laser
that strikes all members for +1600 damage.  BTW, the only way to free a
character is to destroy the arm that's holding them, or have him or her
die.  This makes the Phoenix summon very useful if you just freed a
friend and want to revive and attack at the same time.  You'll get the
God's Hand weapon when you kill it and both arms.
_________________________________________________________________________

With the Carry Armor out of the way, head to the left to find a chest
with the Battle Trumpet inside it.  Then go back to the right and run
along the pier until you reach the gray submarine.  Open the chest by the
stairs to get the Scimitar.  To the left of that chest is a chest
holding a Key Item: the Leviathan Scales.  You'll need it later so be
sure to pick it up.  Go up the stairs to find a bunch of soldiers
running around in place (ha!) who will fight you.  Cloud will then enter
the submarine and be ambushed by three soldiers.  You may win a set of
'Shinra Beta' armor from the guards, but it's not that great.  Anyway,
there's a Save Point here, and when you're done using it, head through
the northern door to reach the bridge of the submarine.

Here, you'll meet two guards and their scared-as-hell commander.  You
can either choose the bottom option and let them live, or you can pick
the top option and kill them.  You can steal the 'Shinra Alpha' (_very_
strong armor) from the captain if you choose to fight.  Whatever your
choice is, examine the captain's seat when you're able to and you'll be
given three options.  Pick the second one to climb into the chair.  From
there, pick the top option to see a description of the sub controls, or
the bottom option to start up the sub and enter the submarine mini-game
(explained below).

Your controls on the submarine are:

S       Shoot torpedoes (only when you're near an enemy craft)
X       Backward thrust
T       Forward thrust
Pad     Move left/right or descend/raise
R1      Switch between close-up or bird's eye view
R2      Switch between near, overhead, or cockpit view
Start   Pause; show control screen

The walls of the ocean floor are shown in blue, and there are diamond-
shaped mines that are invisible until you get close.  You can tell how
far they are from the floor by the red columns beneath them.  The
purpose of this 'mini-game' is to destroy the the main Shinra sub (red)
in the time allotted, although you can kill some of the ten yellow
submarines if you want to.  During the mission, the following warnings
will appear:

WARNING         When an enemy sub is approaching
ALERT           When an enemy sub is firing
MINE            You are about to run into a mine
CONFLICT        The sub cannot move because you are
                steering it against/along a rock face

The sub game plays much faster than it did in the Japanese version, and
the control isn't as sloppy as before (it still takes getting used to).

You lose the game if one of two things happen; time runs out (you have
10 minutes to destroy the submarine), or if your life bar (which is
represented by the red/green bar at the bottom of the screen) is
depleted as a result of being hit by missiles, crashing into the walls
or floor once too often, or ramming another sub.  If you win, then the
submarine you're in is automatically piloted to shore.  If you mess up,
your characters will jettison themselves from the sub.  Either way,
you'll learn that a Huge Materia is being transported from the Junon
Airport.  You can go there (it's the same place where the Highwind was
docked) to see some FMV of the plane taking off, or not (it's optional).

At this point in the game, you have two options available to you.  You
can either sneak back into Junon and get yourself another submarine,
or you can go to Rocket Town and do the fourth and final Huge Materia
quest.  If you already have a submarine, then you can do some underwater
exploring or do the last Huge Materia quest (refer to section 4.10 for
the former and section 4.11 for the latter).  If you need to get a
second submarine, then keep reading.

Go back into the main part of Junon Town and work your way back to the
gray hallway, down the elevator with the woman, and to the room with the
guards, a dog, and the sloping floor.  Beat the guards and examine the
dog.  When he moves aside, follow him and examine him again.  Choose the
top option, and you'll enter the red Shinra submarine.  When the guards
show up, choose the top option to let them go, or the bottom option to
fight them.  In the cockpit room, choose the top option to save the
commander, or the bottom option to fight him and his men.  Either way,
you still get to pilot the sub.  Note that if you got the gray sub, you
can't go through here and get the red sub.

New to the US version is the 'Weapon' scenario--you can now fight the
Emerald Weapon underwater, and meet and trade with the man in the upper-
right house in Kalm Town.  Refer to section 6.5 for details.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4.10  underwater adventure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Huge Materia (listed here because you don't have to
                     get it), Heaven's Cloud, Escort Guard, Conformer,
                     Double Cut materia, Megalixir x2, Elixir, Spirit
                     Lance, Outsider, Highwind Manual, Hades materia, Key
                     to Ancients (listed here because you don't have to
                     get it just yet), Oritsuru, Steal as well materia.

This section outlines a series of side-quests and optional events.  While
some have to be done at a certain point, the others are listed here only
because you now have a submarine and can explore the ocean.  You can skip
this section and go on to 4.11 for the final Huge Materia Quest if you'd
rather do the things in here at a later point.

The controls for either submarine (gray or red) are as follows:

X       Submerge/Ascend
O       Propel forward
        - (doesn't work in overhead view)
Pad     Move in any direction
        - (raise or lower while underwater)
L1/R1   Turn to the left or right
L2/R2   Switch from side/overhead view
        - (doesn't work while underwater)
Start   Show/enlarge/hide map
        - (cannot enlarge map while underwater)
Select  Same as Start

The submarine can cross deep water, but not shallows.  If you can't
get by an area while skimming the sea, try submerging and looking for
a passage.  If you can't get over a rock wall while submerged, try
ascending and looking for another way around.  Also, the sub can only
land at docks such as the one near Junon Town.  BTW, the mini-game at
the Gold Saucer also becomes available once you have a submarine.

If you sunk the red submarine, then get in your submarine and look at
the map.  Head to the chain of small islands southeast from the
weaponsmith's house (the guy who lived near the Gold Saucer).  Submerge
and you'll find the red submarine.  Should you touch it, Cloud will
retrieve the Huge Materia from the wrecked submarine.  If you failed to
sink it earlier, then it won't be here.  Note that you can wait and pick
up the Huge Materia in Disc 3 if you'd rather not get it right now.

Next, return to the Junon Town dock and go west until you reach a
jutting peninsula (or go north from where the red submarine was,
assuming you sunk it).  Go around the penninsula and head south until
you reach land (you'll be in a little bay, near a dock, and you should
be able to see the Golden Saucer from where you are).  Descend and
you'll find a wrecked plane lying on the sea floor.  It's the prototype
Shinra air carrier 'Gelinka'.  Touch it to board the sunken plane.

Inside the plane, go down the ladder.  Run to the left to find a Save
Point and a treasure chest (inside is the Heaven's Cloud sword).
Enter the northern door (the one with the Shinra emblem on it) and
head east along the walkway.  There's a green chest here with an
Escort Guard in it.  Go down the incline to the lowest level of this
room and head to the upper-left corner.  Hidden by a pipe is another
green chest; inside it is Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon, the Conformer.  Now
to all the way to the upper-right corner and search the wall for a hard
to see yellow materia (Double Cut).  Finally, return to the entrance and
go north and then east across the beams.  This leads to the final chest
which has a Megalixir inside of it.

Return to the main room and go through the door on the left wall.  In
the adjoining chamber are Reno and Rude of the Turks, who will talk
to you briefly before attacking your party.

BOSS TIPS: RENO                                LV: 42  HP: 15000  MP: 230
           RUDE                                LV: 49  HP: 20000  MP: 280

Rude (the bald guy) can cast Ice 2 and Fire 2, while Reno will attack
you with his Neo Turks' Light Ray attack.  They also have the nasty
ability to confuse you, which can be a serious problem if the confused
member has a Double Cut or Slash All materia equipped.  Once you inflict
enough damage on one of them, that person will leave.  If you kill Reno,
then Rude will simply stand around until you lower his HP to zero.  Since
this battle is tougher than it might seem, Haste your characters and use
your best attacking and summon spells.  If he's learned it, Cloud's B3/1
should be used whenever possible.  You'll get an Elixir when the battle
is concluded.
_________________________________________________________________________

With the Turks out of the way, go through the northern door.  A chest
sitting near the entrance contains a Megalixir, and if you continue
along the walkway and go all the way to the right, you'll find another
chest with a Spirit Lance inside.  Go down the stairs to the lower area;
near the bottom of the screen are two chests; one to the left and one
to the right.  The left one has an Outsider gun in it, and the right
one contains Cid's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (Highwind).  Before
leaving, look by the wrecked helicopter for a shimmering red sphere
(it's lying between the body of the helicopter and one of the broken,
detached parts next to it).  It's the Hades materia, so pick it up and
then head back to your submarine.  You don't need to return to the
wrecked plane again, although you can fight the monsters here and
transform them into various '-Source' items (you can also do this to
several of the monsters in the Mideel Area).  Considering this game's
difficulty (the lack of, that is), you shouldn't have to do this,
though.

Once you're in the submarine, look at your map.  Just south and east of
the southeastern tip of the Northern Continent are three islands in a
sort of a curving pattern.  If you can't quite tell where you are, just
go along the coast of the Northern Continent until you reach an area
surrounded by shallows where there are three islands (you should be
near snowy ground with patches of grass, in addition to a large
mountain).  Submerge the submarine and look for an underwater tunnel
around here (guide the submarine into the dead-end and turn around; you
should see it as you're moving).  The short tunnel leads to a twisted,
spiky object which you will take (it's called the Key to Ancients;
Bugenhagen asks you to find it later on when you return to the
Ancient City in section 4.12).

Finally, get back in your airship and fly to Wutai on the Westernmost
Continent.  Go up into the Dachao Statue area, and head along the path
until you reach the path that heads north.  Follow it past the statue's
head until you reach another crossroads with a cave entrance nearby.
Enter the cave.  Try to walk into the first fire-pit twice and Cloud
will use the Leviathan Scales (a double-mistranslation; the game calls
it 'Water God Scales' in this part which is correct) on the fires each
time, exposing a green chest which contains a Oritsuru (a shuriken for
Yuffie).  Explore the rest of the cave until you find a second fire-pit.
Press against it to douse it with the Leviathan Scales.  This allows you
to take the blue materia lying on the floor (Steal as well).

  4.11  cid's rocket
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Nothing!

Return to Rocket Town (it's beyond the mountains near the Gold Saucer).
Go to the launch pad.  It's swarming with Shinra soldiers!  Make your
way to the stairs leading up to the rocket and you'll be attacked by
two soldiers.  Deal with them and you'll be attacked by another pair
of soldiers.  At the top of the stairs, you'll fight two more soldiers
and their captain.  After killing them, Cid will show up and insist on
joining if he's not already with you.  After you've made a party, press
X to continue playing, T to go to the Main Menu, or O to change your
party's configuration (but Cloud and Cid cannot be removed from the
current party).  After you choose to continue playing, climb up the
ladder and you'll face off with two Shinra soldiers and Rude of the
Turks.

           ATTACK SQUAD                         LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100

Use physical attacks to kill the soldiers and injure Rude, especially
if you've got the Double Cut and Slash-All materia equipped.  Rude can
use a jumping wave attack, but it only causes about 500 points of damage.
He can also create a MBarrier which he usually casts when one or both of
the soldiers are killed, and he can cast Bolt 2 and heal himself for
about 1100 hit points.  Despite all his powers, he's still easily beaten.
If you kill Rude before finishing off the guards, you'll automatically
win the battle.  You may win an S-mine once you win the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

Go inside the rocket ship--you'll have to fight another battle, but it's
easily won.  Press O to open the northern door, then go into the main
room, where Cid will talk to the workers.  After the rocket lifts off,
go to the right into the next room and climb up the ladder.  Examine the
Huge Materia in the next room and choose the top option.  Cid will chat
with Cloud and several numbered boxes will appear.  When they do, punch
in the following code, one press per message box:

First Message (1):      O
Second Message (2):     S
Third Message (3):      X
Fourth Message (4):     X

If you did it correctly, the glass tube will open and you can take the
Huge Materia.  If you mess up, you'll have 3 minutes to get the code
right, and Cid will try to clue you in to the correct code.  Should the
timer reach zero, the Huge Materia is lowered into the ground.

Whether you got the Huge Materia or not, return to the entry room and
climb down the ladder; when you get near the sparking tanks, they will
explode.  With a little help from Shera, you'll free Cid from under a
piece of metal.  Follow Shera into the next room (which turns out to
be an escape capsule).  You can go to your menu during the scene in
which the people in front of the Shinra Building are looking at the
Meteor ^^;.  After a lengthy FMV sequence, you'll find yourself back in
Highwind, and the Meteor hanging in the sky will now be much closer than
it was before.  Alternately, you can do this part (see the tanks
explode) and then go back and get/not get the Huge Materia, or you can
even do this part and then take the escape pod without even attempting
to free the Huge Materia (which means you obviously won't get it).

  4.12  forgotten capital revisited / midgar city under siege
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Rising Sun, Ultima Weapon, Elixir x3, Megalixir,
                     Aegis Bracelet, Starlight Horn, Max Ray, Power
                     Source x2, Guard Source, Magic Source, Mind Source
                     x2, Speed Source, W-Item materia, Master Fist, Pile
                     Banger, Grow Lance, Behimoth Horn, HP Shout,
                     Ragnarok, Mystile, Missing Score.

Get in the Highwind and return to Cosmo Canyon.  Make your way up to the
observatory and talk to Bugenhagen.  Cloud will use the PHS system to
call the rest of his friends up to Bugenhagen's home.  They'll all
talk about Sephiroth and Aeris, and then leave Cloud alone with
Bugenhagen, who offers to keep the Huge Materia at his observatory for
safekeeping.  Touch any of the Huge Materia you have and pick the
bottom option to return to the Highwind.  Bugenhagen will accompany
you.  Pilot the Highwind back to the Northern Continent and land in the
canyon where the Forgotten Capital is located.  At the crossroads, take
the left path and follow it into the chamber with the blue crystal that
you couldn't do anything to earlier.  Head right along the upper path
and take the stairs up to the crystal.  Bugenhagen will talk to
Cloud and his friends.  If you already got the Key to Ancients,
Bugenhagen uses it to create a waterfall.  If you didn't get it yet,
he'll remain here in the Forgotten Capital until you find it and return
to him with it.

Once the waterfall has been activated, walk towards the crystal a second
time.  Pictures of Aeris will be shown in the falling water while Bugen
talks to your party.  Now, leave the Forgotten Capital. As you do, Cait
Sith calls on Cloud's phone and tells him that the Sister Ray in Junon
Town has been reinstalled in Midgar City, and that it's going to be used
to destroy the barrier around the crater (where Sephiroth's at).  After
seeing some more FMV, return to the Highwind.  Just as you're about to
board it, another Weapon monster shows up and starts advancing towards
Midgar City.  Since you can't attack it while in the Highwind, and you
can't reach it using the submarine, wait until it reaches dry land, then
try and touch it.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS:  DIAMOND WEAPON                    LV: ??  HP: 50000  MP: 3000
                                                 (weak against Lightning)

First, cast Barrier on yourselves to reduce physical damage.  Then cast
Slow on the Diamond Weapon.  The Diamond Weapon is normally immune to
_any_ physical attack, so use magic: Bolt 3, Tornado, Break, and Ultima
all work very well.  Enemy Skills and Summons are okay to use, but you're
better off with magic.  The Diamond Weapon may become susceptible to
physical attacks (it won't happen every time you fight it), use Limit
Breaks, 4x-Cut, and other strong attacks.  The Diamond Weapon's attacks
are weak; it has a laser ray (700+ damage) and a foot stomp attack (1000+
damage).  When the Diamond Weapon's HP are getting low, it will open it's
chest cavity and prepare for the 'Countdown' attack.  Unless you kill it
in three rounds, it will perform a 'Diamond Flash' that does around 1500
to 3500 damage to all members, in addition to 'Silencing' them.  It will
keep doing the 'Countdown' and then 'Diamond Flash' until it dies.  It
seems as if it will automatically become vulnerable to physical attacks
(items, thrown items, coins, attacking) once it's used the Diamond
Flash at least once.  Note that you can't drain MP from it if it makes
itself susceptible to physical attacks (because it becomes immune to
magic attacks). You can steal a Rising Sun from it during the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

Afterwards, you'll see the Sister Ray destroy the Diamond Weapon and the
shield surrounding the crater, while the Weapon makes a last ditch attack
against Midgar.

At this point in the game, if you return to the lake near Junon Town,
the Ultimate Weapon will be hovering over the lake.  You can battle the
Ultimate Weapon by ramming into it while aboard the Highwind.  However,
it will fly away after fighting with you for awhile.  From this point
on, it will fly around the sky and make it's way to various random
locations.  It might seem as if you could just wait around for the
Ultimate Weapon to show up here and there, but the beast will fly in
circles unless you find it and ram into it repeatedly.  After 4 or 5
tries, it will then head towards a new location and sit there until you
attack again.  After escaping a few more times, it will make a final
stop at Cosmo Canyon (it does this after losing a certain amount of HP,
so you may fight it several times or only twice, depending on how much
damage you can inflict per battle.  You can fight it to the death here
(it's a pushover, so don't expect too much of a challenge), and when it
dies, you get Cloud's Ultimate Weapon (the Ultima Weapon).  Furthermore,
it will create a crater when it crashes into the ground, wiping out
several of the rock formations around Cosmo Canyon.  However, you can
now walk across the crater and go into the Ancient Forest!  Normally, you
can't reach this place unless you're using a colored Chocobo.  If you
don't want to fight the Ultimate Weapon now, you still fight it during
Disc 3.

Anyway, pilot the Highwind back to the crater when you're ready.  Before
you can explore it further, Reeve (y'know, the guy who controls Cait
Sith) reveals that Hojo (one of the members of the Jenova Project) is
planning to use the Sister Ray again, even though the results could be
catastrophic considering how much energy it used up last time.  So you
have to get back into Midgar City and stop Hojo beforehand.

When you're ready to raid Midgar City, fly the Highwind straight towards
it, as if you were going to ram into it.  Cloud and his allies will
gather together on the airship's deck.  You can now choose the top
option to assemble a new party, or the bottom option to leap off the
ship and parachute into the city.  When you can move, follow your
friend to an alleyway where your pals are waiting.  There's also a Save
Point here.  Talk to whoever is by the wooden panel and they'll open it
to reveal a ladder leading down into the depths of Midgar City.  At the
bottom of the ladder, go along the metal passage and down the slope.
Go up the the next slope and when you reach the wall, head left to
find a chest containing an Elixir, and then run to the right to find a
chest with a Megalixir inside of it.

Make your way back to the area with the ladder and take the stairs down
to an area with a ladder.  If you climb down the ladder, you'll reach a
long walkway; head west and then go north to arrive at another ladder.
Climb up it and you'll have access to the green chest you saw earlier;
it contains an Aegis Bracelet.  Climb back down to the long walkway and
run to the right.  The floor will give way and you'll be deposited on a
lower walkway.  Head left, jump on top of the pipe, and then ascend the
ladder.  When you arrive at another ladder, climb up it, too.

Eventually you'll arrive at a path just below the one you were walking
around on earlier.  Walk along it until you reach a chute; walk into it
and you'll be deposited in a new area.  Check out the green chest to the
left (there's a Starlight Horn inside it).  Then go to the right and open
the chest that's near the ladder (it contains an Elixir).  Climb down the
ladder and press against the right lip of the platform in order to jump
down to the chute labled '42'.  Enter the chute, and when you arrive at
the other end, head left and then go up the ladder.  At the top, you'll
find a chest to the left; there's a Max Ray inside it. Retrace your
steps until you're back at the other area, press left to jump off the
chute and back onto the platform, and then climb up the ladder and go
up the stairs to your left (it's right next to the chute labled '12').

At the top of the stairs is a Save Point.  To the right of it is a
crawlway.  Make you way along it and you'll arrive in an underground
tunnel system.  Climb down to the floor and head south.  While many of
the passages here split off in two directions, one direction will always
end in a blocked door, so keep going south.  As you keep going, you'll
run into your friends (remember, who you meet up with depends on who is
and isn't in your group).  After heading south for a couple of screens,
you'll find a treasure chest lying against the left wall of one of those
'split-passage' areas I mentioned earlier.  Inside it is a Power Source.
At the next split-passage area that you come across, there is a treasure
chest in the area between the doorways.  There's a Guard Source inside
it.  Keep going south, and when you reach the next split-passage area,
there will be two chests lying in the area between the doorways.  The
one to the left has a Magic Source inside it, and the one to the right
contains a Mind Source. If you go south from here, you'll arrive at a
dead end.  In the left corner of this area is a Save Point, and in the
right corner there is a yellow materia (W-Item).  Note that you can use
the W-Item materia to duplicate items (refer to Section 8).  If you
press against the wall, you'll discover that you can't go any further.

So, go all the way back to the first area (where the ladder was).  Try
to head to the north and guess who shows up!  It's the remaining Turks,
and they're here for a final showdown with Cloud and his friends.  If
you completed Yuffie's sub-quest (saved Elena from Corneo in Wutai),
then the Turks will make an offer: fight them or part and go your
seperate ways.  If you haven't done this optional quest, then you have
no choice but to fight them.

BOSS TIPS: ELENA                               LV: ??  HP: 30000  MP: ???
           RENO                                LV: 50  HP: 25000  MP: 200
           RUDE                                LV: 51  HP: 28000  MP: 250

Elena is healed by lightning attacks, Reno by ice attacks, and Rude
by fire attacks.  Rude has a punch attack that hits one character for
2000 points of damage, Elena can throw a firebomb that inflicts 500 to
600 points of damage (in addition to a Amulet attack), and Reno uses a
spark attack which will cause 800 HPs worth of damage.  They all have
more attacks than these; but I'm listing the ones the seem to use most
often.  Alone, they aren't much, but with all three of them fighting
together, this becomes one of the toughest battles in game.  Barrier
and Haste your allies, then use spells like Ultima and Tornado to soften
the Turks up i3n addition to Limit Breaks.  Try to save Phoenix until you
really need it, since it will revive your members but heal Rude.  All
three Turks will escape once you've defeated them in battle.  You'll get
an Elixir when the battle is over.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the battle, go north.  When you reach the split passage area, go
right.  If Cid isn't in your current party, he'll show up here.  Take the
right path and at the next split passage, take the left path.  You'll
arrive at a blocked passage, but there's a ladder against the left wall
that leads to the Shinra Headquarters.  If Cait Sith is in your party,
he'll talk to you.  Otherwise, you'll see him hop out of the building.
If you didn't read Turtle's Paradise Flyer No. 2 the first time around,
you can check out the billboard at the back end of the first floor to
read it now.  Go up the stairs near the front and look for a door marked
'Accessories' near the other end of this floor.  In the adjoining room,
you can open two chests that a Shinra employee wouldn't let you
examine earlier.  The one to the right contains a Master Fist and the
left one has a Pile Banger inside of it.  Before leaving, go up to the
64th floor and look for the lockers (go north from the elevators).  If
you examine the left end of the row of lockers against the wall, you'll
find the HP Shout (Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon that you couldn't
take earlier).

Other treasure in the Shinra Headquarters includes: if you put money
into the health drink machines on floor 64, you can get a Speed Source
and a Mind Source from them now, if you choose to hit them.  On the
floor with the 'three coupons' puzzle, you'll find a bag containing
the Grow Lance in the room to the left of the entry hall.  And a bag
containing the 'Behimoth Horn' can be found on the stairwell you may
have used when raiding the Shinra HQ (Tifa's method)--it's one
screen above the level where you found an Elixir last time (the Elixir
will still be their if you didn't get it then, BTW).

Return to the underground passages again.  Go south past one split-
passage room, and when you reach the second room, take the left path.
You'll go outside.  Walk towards the lefthand red beam to climb up it
and jump onto the main street.  Head north and a huge mechanical monster
will appear from behind you; it's being controlled by Heidegger and
Scarlet.  After laughing in your face, they'll attack you.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: PROUD CLOD                          LV: ??  HP: 60000  MP: ???
           JAMAR ARMOR                         LV: 62  HP: 20000  MP: 300

This mechanical monstrosity has two parts; a head and a chest area that
you can aim your attacks at.  The boss can only cause around 500-800
points of damage, but it can kneel and fire a ray from it's back (the
Beam Cannon attack) that causes 1100 damage to all members.  Even after
disabling the Jamar Armor (it can use it's Materia Jammer attack to
disable your Materia), you'll still have to keep attacking the main part
if you want to kill it.  Spells and summonings work nicely, and you
shouldn't worry about your HP until the boss kneels and readies it's
laser attack.  You'll get the Ragnarok sword once the fight is over.
_________________________________________________________________________

Once the machine explodes, it starts to rain.  Head north.  There are
two chests near the entrance.  The one closest to you has an Elixir in
it, while the one that's further away contains a Mystile.  Use the
Save Point that's nearby if you want to, then climb up the ladders.
If he's not in your party, Vincent will be on the lower landing.  The
second landing is normally empty, but if Barret is in your party, you
will see a green chest there.  Open it to get Barret's Ultimate Weapon,
the Missing Score.  If Barret's not in you party, you won't find anything
on the landing, even if you search it thoroughly.  Once you've climbed
all the way to the top, run to the right.  Sitting at the Mako Cannon's
(Sister Ray's) controls is Hojo, who will attack your party when you
talk to him.  If Vincent's in your party, he'll trash talk Hojo for a
moment beforehand.

           LIFEFORM HOJO-NA                    (can't see his stats.)

Hojo can use his 'Capsule' power to summon the two 'Sample' monsters
every time you kill them.  So, concentrate on defeating Hojo instead of
the lesser monsters.  He'll then reappear as a huge monster with two
independent arms (Helletic Hojo).  Since Hojo can bring the arms back
to life, aim your attacks at the main body of the boss.  He may cast
Confuse or Silence on you, so I hope you have some Ribbons equipped.
The right arm will also inflict a lot of damage, so cast Barrier
beforehand.  In his final form, Hojo can cast Slow and employ a
multiple-hit attack (Combo), which will poison whoever is hit by it.
As long as you keep your HPs up, this battle is a cinch.  You'll receive
a Power Source once you've killed Hojo.
_________________________________________________________________________

You'll return to the Highwind after killing the boss.  There's a short
sequence with Tifa and Cloud afterward, then the Highwind blasts off
into the sky.  Well, that's the end of this disc!


=========================================================================
  5.  DISC THREE WALKTHROUGH
=========================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  5.1  northern crater
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Limited Moon, Save Crystal, Guard Source x3, Mind
                    Source x2, Magic Source x2, Elixir x2, Power
                    Source x2, HP Absorb materia, Megalixir x4, Hero
                    Drink x3, Mystile, Speed Source x2, Tetra Elemental,
                    Almighty Medicine x2, Vaccine x2, Shield materia,
                    Imperial Guard, W-Magic materia, Counter materia,
                    X-Potion x2, Turbo Ether x2, Everything All materia,
                    Luck Source

You'll start off on the deck of the Highwind.  If you'd rather explore
the World Map instead, just go back to the cockpit, talk to the engineer
next to Cid, and choose the top option.  If you haven't noticed it yet,
the Highwind is now rocket-powered.

Before descending into the crater and exploring the Northern Crater, you
may want to pick up Red 13's Ultimate Weapon.  Return to Cosmo Canyon and
climb up to the second floor of the observatory, making sure that Red 13
is in your group beforehand (you can switch characters at the Save Point
near the Tiger Lily Arms Shop if you need to).  Bugenhagen is lying
on his couch.  He chats with Red 13 for a while, then leaves (I thought
he died!  Yeesh!)  Back at the bonfire, Red 13 rejoins his companions,
and now has the Limited Moon in his inventory.  Also, if you haven't
gotten either of the 'optional' characters yet (Yuffie or Vincent), then
now would be a good time to add them to your party.

When you're ready to explore the Northern Crater, land the Highwind and
go out to the deck.  You can talk to the man out here to change party
members (he'll automatically ask you every time you return to the
Highwind).  Climb down the rope ladder to reach a new area, then head
southwest.  In the next screen you'll be given an option: pick the
bottom one to turn back or the top one to descend into the pit.  After
hopping down the steps, you'll see a cavern entrance.  If you go inside
it, it merely returns you to the last area, in which you can climb up
the stone column and make your way back to the Highwind.  Otherwise,
simply follow the path as it winds it's way down into the ground.  Don't
worry should the ground crumble away since you can jump over the gaps.
The first chest you find contains a Save Crystal.  It can be used once
while in the Northern Crater to create a Save Point.  Considering that
there are no Save Points at all in this level, the Save Crystal is a
handy item to have.  The next chest you find has a Guard Source in it.

In the next area, you can climb the silver parts of the ledges by
pressing O when you are standing near them (a message appears prompting
you to do this).  Go to the right and hop down the 'steps'.  The first
chest you find has a Guard Source inside of it.  Be sure to make your way
to the next chest and not explore the edge of the ledge below the chest
you just opened or you'll jump down to the bottom and will have to
climb all the way back up again (although you'll be doing that at some
point anyway, so it's no big deal).  In the second chest is a Mind
Source.  You can now either climb back up and get the rest of the chests,
or continue searching the Northern Crater and get the chests when you are
coming back out (assuming you want to make more than one journey into the
Pit). To get the chests, climb up the ledge to your left (you're at the
bottom of the screen, remember?)  Go all the way to the left and climb
up two ledges, then walk to the right to find another chest containing
a Magic Source.  Go left again, go up to the next ledge, then go to the
right and climb up again.  Walk all the way to the right, climb up the
tall ledge, then head left to find a chest holding an Elixir.  From
there, walk up to the next ledge, go to the left, and climb up the
silver part to arrive at a chest that has a Power Source in it.  If you
go to the right, you'll find an HP Absorb materia just past a large rock.
Finally, jump back down, go to the right, and climb up the ledge to
reach the top again (you can jump to the top ledge from here and exit
the Pit by going back up the spiraling passage).

If you head south from the bottom of the screen, you'll arrive at a large
chamber pocked with holes.  Walk to the right until you fall down a
level, then go left to uncover a chest (inside is a Mind Source).  Go to
the edge of this ledge, turn around, and press O to juMP Plus to the
upper ledge (just like in the last area, you'll be prompted to jump
whenever you are near a ledge ending).  Head left until you fall down,
then go to the right and step into the hole by pressing up.  Beyond the
opening is a treasure chest containing a Megalixir.  Go back out again
and walk all the way to the left and you will fall down to a new level
(since you can't see Cloud, move left or right until he falls).  Run to
the right in order to find a chest, which has a Hero Drink inside of it.
Walk to the left and enter the hole.  As you walk along the adjoining
path, stop to open a treasure chest to your left which holds a Guard
Source, and go through the hole that's a little farther up to reach a
chest with a Power Source inside it.  Go back out the hole and keep
climbing to reach an opening that deposits you back at the top of the
screen.  To get back down to the bottom, run to the right until you drop
down, press right again to fall a second time, and enter the hole.  The
passage beyond it leads to another hole; press left to fall down it (if
you want to get back up, just climb the ledges to your left).  Then walk
to the left until you fall, and walk right to fall again.

Here, climb down the two stalactites in order to reach the ground where
your friends are waiting.  Each one asks you which path they should take,
the left one (top option), or the right one (bottom option).
Furthermore, you may have certain characters join you (depending on
which path you took), or you may be asked to make a new group (if you
asked characters in your group to go in another direction).

Take whatever path is available to you (you'll get a message if you can't
go in that direction).  Refer to the LEFT PATH or RIGHT PATH sections
depending on which one is available to you.  Note that once you reach the
PLACE OF GATHERING, you can go back and explore all the areas freely
(remember that because you may be approaching an area from a different
location, you may have to do it in a different order.  For instance, you
can tackle the LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE area from either the top or bottom,
so take note while playing (and no, I'm not going to write out the
section backwards and forwards, just figure it out yourself depending on
where you're going!)

RIGHT PATH
You'll find yourself on a column of stone.  Follow the winding path that
leads along the column.  Eventually, you'll reach a gap in the path.
Pick the top option to jump down to the area below, or the bottom option
to turn back.  When you land on the ground, look to your right for a
chest containing a Mystile.  To your left is a green Elixir.  Take it
and continue along the path until you reach a broad, gray area.  Here,
there is a treasure chest to the north containing a Speed Source.  If you
look to the south, wedged between several broken structures is another
chest that has a Tetra Elemental inside it.  Go back to the main path
and head east, then north.  Here, the path splits to the north or the
west.

Take the west branch and it'll lead to a dead-end where there is a chest.
Inside it is a Megalixir.  Retrace your steps and keep going north;
just to your right will be a chest that also has a Megalixir inside of
it.  If you keep going north, you'll arrive at a bridge made of curving
bones.  Work your way down it and you'll arrive at the PLACE OF GATHERING
(see below).

LEFT PATH
In this room, your teammates will each ask if you should take the upper
(top option) or lower (bottom option) route.  Pick accordingly, and refer
to the UPPER ROUTE and LOWER ROUTE sub-sections depending on what you
chose.  You may be prompted to make a new party yet again after you have
decided on the route you will take.

LEFT PATH: UPPER ROUTE
Hop down onto the branch-like structure, run to the right, and when you
can't go any further, press Up to jump to another branch.  From here, go
right to reach a chest containing a Magic Source.  Now, hop back to the
first branch and go left, then north.  When you reach the edge, Cloud
will jump onto the nearby rocks.  Walk north along the path and Cloud
will dive in the water and jump out on the other side of the screen.  If
you walk to the left, then go north, you'll arrive at a chest which has
an Remedy within it.  Head right, but take the upper branch
(go east, then north) in order to arrive at a new area.

Here, head to the far right to find a chest which contains an Hero Drink.
Then take the upper path and run all he way to the left.  If you go a
little ways to the north, you'll see a chest; it has a Vaccine in it.
To the right of the chest is a large rock; walk in front of it and you'll
see a path that leads up to the top of the rock, where a green materia is
lying on the ground (Shield).  Take it and walk to the left, then press
Down to descend the rock face.  Cloud will jump into the water and pop
out again near a treasure chest (Imperial Guard).  After opening the
chest, keep pressing Down and Cloud will dive into the water again and
end up on the other side of the screen.  From here, run south and then
east to reach yet another unexplored area.

This area is full of green shrubbery and stone tiers.  Walk to the left
in order to work your way down the tiers, but then go to the center of
the screen and walk north until you're right beneath the shrubbery.
There is a small dot here; press O to examine it and you'll find that
it's the W-Magic materia.  From here, work your way down to the
shining light (go south, then east).  There is a patch of darkness in
the light--examine it and you'll get the Counter materia.  Now, walk
west and then north to find a cave entrance.  It leads to the PLACE OF
GATHERING (see below).

LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE
Hop down the stone columns and investigate the chest to your left to
find a Remedy.  Head to the right and hop up the stone columns to arrive
at a chest that has an Elixir inside of it.  Then go back to the first
treasure chest and press against the bottom of the ledge.  You'll hop
down to a column where there is a chest containing an X-Potion.  Make
your way to the southeast.  In the next screen, hop down the stone
columns and then go to the left to find a chest with an Turbo Ether in
it.  Then follow the path east and north.  There's another chest here
and a Vaccine is inside it.  Walk to the west, then follow the path
south and hop across the columns.  When you reach the bottom of the
screen, run to the south.

In this area, go to the right and press down to hop down to a small
ledge.  Below is a larger ledge and a green chest (X-Potion).  Walk to
the left across the thin stone bridge, drop down a level, then keep
going right until you see some stone 'steps'.  Go down them; to the
left is a green chest containing a Turbo Ether.  If you walk to the
left, you'll jump down to a low ledge.  Nearby, there is a ball
floating in the air.  Hold Up in order to jump from a small ledge to a
larger ledge, and when you get near the ball, tap O repeatedly.  If you
timed it right, you'll be able to take the ball, which is actually the
Mega All materia.  If you missed it, just press left to
jump back down to the lower ledge and then try again.  You can only get
the materia while jumping to the small ledge, not while jumping from
the large western ledge.

Once you've gotten the materia and are on the large ledge, walk to the
other end of it.  There's a chest here (Speed Plus Source).  Now walk to
the south and press against the edge to jump down to a lower area.  Keep
walking south and you'll reach the PLACE OF GATHERING.

PLACE OF GATHERING  (my name for it, okay?)
On the right side of this chamber is a chest containing a Luck Source.
Follow the path as it curves around until you reach a set of stone
steps.  Your friends will show up here.  Depending on where you told
them to go earlier, they may or may not have items to give you.  Talk
to each one of them to get an item (or not), then approach the stone
steps.  Pick the top option to go down them or the bottom option to
stay where you are.  Once you pick the top option, you can't go back,
so feel free to choose the bottom option and then leave this area from
the upper ledge (walk to the left) if you have more exploring to do.

Once you've chosen the top option, assemble a new group.  You'll leap
down the steps and arrive at the lowest levels of the Northern Crater
(home not only to Jenova and Sephiroth but also to massive slowdown).
Simply jump from floating ledge to floating ledge, working your way
towards the bottom of the screen.  In the second screen, make your way
to the central island of rock, where the final form of Jenova will
appear and attack you.

BOSS TIPS: JENOVA*SYNTHESIS                    LV: ??  HP: 60000  MP: ???
           JENOVA*SYNTHESIS B                  LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 600
           JENOVA*SYNTHESIS C                  LV: 61  HP: 8000   MP: 600

Start the round by using Haste and Barrier on yourselves, then use Enemy
Skills and Summon Materia to dish out damage.  The tentacle-like arms
will droop and become useless after you've attacked them long enough,
but they regenerate with some HP if you don't kill the boss quickly, so
use high-level spells (Ultima or Inseki) to take them out and injure
Jenova at the same time.  When she is about to die, a message appears
and starts counting down the rounds from 5; if you don't kill her by the
time it reaches zero, Jenova Synthesis will cast Ultima.  For the second-
to-last boss, this is an easy battle. She has very weak physical attacks
(500-800 damage), and not much else. If you want to conserve MP, you can
take out the boss using physical attacks with little injury to yourself.
If she does cast Ultima, the battle ends, but you get no EXP, GP, or AP,
so try to kill her as quickly as possible.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the death of Jenova Synthesis, the ground will break up and Cloud
and his friends will awaken to find themselves floating in space.
Sephiroth makes his final appearance here, floating next to the core of
the Northern Crater.  You'll get to make a new party*, then the battle
with Sephiroth will commence.

*  This is dependant on how long it took you to arrive at, and kill,
   Jenova Synthesis.

BOSS TIPS: BIZZARO SEPHIROTH A                 LV: 61  HP: 40000  MP: ???
           BIZZARO SEPHIROTH B                 LV: 61  HP: 2000   MP: 400
           BIZZARO SEPHIROTH C                 LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 400
           BIZZARO SEPHIROTH D                 LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400
           BIZZARO SEPHIROTH E                 LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400

Use Wall and Haste on yourselves (maybe even Regen), then use your best
attacks against Sephiroth, like Coin Toss, Ultima, and summon spells.
Every time you kill a few of of it's body parts, you'll be asked if you
want to switch to another team (left option to switch, right option to
keep using the current party).  In this case (if you have more than one
team), you'll find that only one team can damage the yellow orb (part C)
of Sephiroth's body.  Once part C is sufficiently damaged, you'll get a
message stating that Cloud can now attack part C as well, so switch back
to him and attack Sephiroth.  Once part C is destroyed, kill off the
rest of the body parts.  If you only have one team, all you can do is
attack.  The number of teams you have will affect the strategy used
against this boss, so keep that in mind when attacking*.  I'm not exactly
sure about this, but: Sephiroth will gain more HP and MP in proportion
to Cloud's experience level, and using the Knights of Round materia
will _usually_ kill Sephiroth.  If you more than one team, keep in mind
that the battle will end if even one team is killed.  And interestingly
enough, the number of times you've used a summon materia resets when you
switch to a team and back.

Sephiroth can heal himself using a technique called Bizzaro Enegy, and
he can use it to bring defeat body parts back to life.  Among his attacks
are Demi 3, an explosion attack that causes 1500+ points of damage, a
fire ray emitted from his chest that inflicts 1700+ damage, and a 'Fallen
Angel'-type attack that reduces all party members' HP to one point.

* I'm saying this because one time I was able to kill Bizzaro Sephiroth
  before receiving the message to attack part C.
_________________________________________________________________________

Once Bizzaro Sephiroth has been defeated, Sephiroth shows up in a new
form.  You always fight him using the team that Cloud is a part of.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: SAFER SEPHIROTH                     LV: ??  HP: 72359  MP: ???

Safer Sephiroth can cast Slow, Flare, Wall, Break, Doom, and Dispel
(Dispel will affect all members).  Other attacks include Supernova (a
'summon' style spell that inflicts 1100-2200 damage to all allies; it
causes confusion and silence), Pale Horse (a laser attack causing 3700-
3800 damage), and Dein (ring-shaped flares break apart the ground and
cause 1200-1300 damage to all members.  His sole physical attack is a
wing slash that causes upwards of 5000 damage points.  Sephiroth can fly
around, too, preventing some characters from using certain skills or
attacks against him.

Use Wall on yourself, and then heal, revive, and fix status ailments
with the Angel's Whisper Enemy Skill.  Haste yourselves and use physical
attacks, your best summon materia, and Ultima.  You can even use Coin
Toss or Throw if you want.  Safer Sephiroth isn't easy to kill, but
he's certainly no challenge, even if you have low levels.

Just remember that Safer Sephiroth's stats. and attack patterns change,
depending on what Cloud's level is.  Safer Sephiroth will have far more
HP and be very vicious if Cloud is Level 99, as compared to Cloud being
at Level 50.
_________________________________________________________________________

After a brief automated sequence, Cloud fights Sephiroth one last time.
I'll leave this up to you...I doubt you'll lose!


=========================================================================
  6.  BONUS AREAS
=========================================================================

You can only go to these areas in Disc 2 or 3, excluding Yuffie's quest
which you can do in Disc 1 or 2 only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  6.1  ancient forest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:          On a cliff near Cosmo Canyon on the Western Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo.  Or, climb past
                   the crater that's left behind when you kill the
                   Ultimate Weapon in Disc 3--it destroys part of the
                   cliff.
Items to get:      Supershot ST, Spring Gun Clip, Slash-All materia,
                   Typoon materia, Apocalypse, Elixir.

You can grab items (frogs, big frogs, wasp nests, etc.) by pressing the
O button.  When you grab a frog for the first time, you get a message
informing you that if you press the S button, the _entire_ area will
reset, returning all the items to their proper place.  However, it also
returns you to the very start of the area, no matter how many screens
you've worked your way through.  If you mess up on an area (you run
out of frogs to use for transportation), you can cheat by leaving the
area and returning (if it's possible to leave given your current
location).  But if you're really stuck, you have no choice but to reset
the whole level by pressing S.  You will keep all items and materia orbs
you've collected so far, though.  Also, when you hear a frog croaking,
look for a place where you can let go of a small frog you might be
carrying as it'll be replaced with a big frog.

In the first area, pick up three frogs and go beneath the earth bridge.
Put them near the three bags hanging from the trees.  Now, quickly take
the frogs and press the O button to make them hop into the bags; repeat
this until all three bags are full by standing on a bag and pressing O
to put a frog into the next bag.  When they're all full, hop to the
other side of the gap.  Once on the other side, go down the slope and
_carefully_ inch towards the center of the large snapping plant.  Press
O to grab the bag (which contains the Supershot ST gun).  If you get too
close, the plant will close and you'll lose almost all your HP.  You can
make as many attempts as you want, but it's best to try and not touch
the center of the plant in the first place.  Continue to the right when
you're finished here and Cloud will automatically use the pink vine to
reach the other side.  Go past the tree and nab the item bag on the hill
(there's a Spring Gun Clip inside), and head right to reach the next part
of the forest.

In the second area, pick up one frog and approach the pink vine.  Choose
the top option to leap to the ledge.  If you leave the frog on the ledge,
it'll be switched with a big frog (or you can just use your small frog).
From here, you can put the frog in the bag and leap across to the second
(already-full) bag.  You'll automatically use the pink vine to jump to
the ground.  Now, pick up a frog and climb on top of the green ledge to
your right; let it go  and it will leap into the left bag.  If you wait
long enough, you'll be sent flying to the ledge above when the frog
escapes (you have to use a big one).  Once on the ledge, take the wasp
nest.  Jump back down.  Stand near the small snapping plant and press O
to release the nest; if you're at the right distance, the nest will fly
backward and land in the plant, which will snap it up.  Take the yellow
materia (Slash-All).  Pick up the big frog again.  Climb to the green
ledge one more time and let the frog jump into the right bag.  Jump atop
it and wait until you are thrust onto the opposite side of the huge
snapping plant.  Run to the right to reach the next zone.

In the third area, pick up two frogs, toss them into the bags, and leap
across to the pink vine.  You'll be lifted into the treetops.  Go left,
then down the trunk to reach the big bag you saw back in the second area.
A Minerva Band is inside.  If you go too far down the trunk, you'll jump
down to the ground, so return to the treetops after grabbing the bag.  If
for some reason you can't, just hop back down repeat the last few steps
to get across the plant, get into the next screen, and return to the
treetops.

Once you're back in the trees, climb to the upmost branch and head right,
then make your way towards the broken branch; Cloud will vault across
three of the pink vines and land on another branch.  Go south to get yet
another item bag holding a red materia (Typoon).  Now, go back across the
vines, and take the lower branch that leads behind the leaves to the
ground level (look for a path leading right).  Once on the ground, grab
a frog.  There are two bags to your right; look for a high ledge beneath
them, stand on it, and toss the frog into the bag.  Then, hop onto it and
make your way over to the second bag, then to the ledge with the wasp's
nest.  Take it and drop to the ground, then approach the snapping plant
and press O to release the nest.  If you are positioned correctly, you'll
toss the nest into the plant, which will close up.

Pick up a small frog and move past the plant.  Stand on the left ledge,
and let go of the frog; it will jump into the nearby bag.  Hop across
the bag and onto the ground.  Run to the left and grab a frog.  Put it
in the hollow in the tree next to you and a big frog will jump out.
Take it and go back the way you came (put the big frog in the bag, jump
to the other side, and wait for it to land by your feet).  Grab it
again, go to the far right ledge, and release it into the bag.  Now,
stand on the bag and wait for the frog to escape.  Doing this sends you
flying across the gap to a cave entrance.

In the cave, walk to the right to find a chest with the Apocalypse sword
lying within.  Head to the north, then go east to find another chest
(there's an Elixir in it).  Finally, exit through the opening to your
left.  You're back outside!  Yup, there are no bosses to fight in this
area (which is a good thing in case you had a hard time dealing with the
snapping plants).

  6.2  vincent's waterfall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:          Waterfall in the center of the Western Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to go to the
                   west side of the waterfall by the lake.  Dismount
                   and touch the waterfall to enter it.  Alternately,
                   you can go there in submarine--you can dock on
                   the dark-colored western side of the shore.
Items to get:      Death Penalty, Chaos Manual (second visit)

Beyond the waterfall is a room made of white stone.  If Vincent isn't
in your party, then you'll get a message stating his name when you
step past the threshold of the room.  So, return with Vincent.  This
time, there's a woman there, Lucresia, and you'll get to see a flashback
of Vincent's past.  While you don't get anything out of this if you
visit only once, you can get Vincent's best weapon and his Level 4 Limit
Break Manual if you come here with him in your party again in the second
or third disc.  Refer to the 'Ultimate Weapons' section for more
information on this area.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  6.3  bonus materia locations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

_________________________________________________________________________
WESTERNMOST CAVE   (Wutai Area)

Location:          Cave lying to the east of a mountain in the bridge-
                   covered region of the Westernmost Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to climb over
                   the mountain.  Dismount and enter the cave.
Items to get:      Mime materia.

There's nothing in here but a glowing yellow light.  Try to touch it,
and you'll get a yellow materia (Mime).  Notice how there's still
a glow after you've taken the Materia? :)

_________________________________________________________________________
WESTERN CAVE       (North Corel Area)

Location:          Cave next to a mountain lying on a square of brown
                   land.  There's a river running nearby.  It's
                   beyond the mountain footpath by the shallow part
                   of the river near the Gold Saucer, on the Western
                   Continent--there's another cave entrance by the
                   river you need to cross.
How to get there:  Use a Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo to cross the
                   river to the patch of land where the cave is.
Items to get:      HP<->MP materia.

Inside this icy blue cave is a twinkling purple materia (HP<->MP).

_________________________________________________________________________
SOUTHERNMOST CAVE  (Mideel Area)

Location:          Cave lying at the end of a penninsula on the north
                   stretch of land on the Southernmost Continent.

How to get there:  If you have a Blue Chocobo, land the Highwind on the
                   patch of grass on the thin island near Mideel.  Then
                   use the shallows connecting the peninsulas to reach
                   the area where the cave is.  If you have a Black or
                   Gold Chocobo, simply land on the grassy area near the
                   cave and keep walking down the cliff and out to where
                   the cave entrance is.  If you have the Gold Chocobo,
                   you can just walk southeast from the Chocobo Farm
                   across the water to the penninsula where the cave is.
Items to get:      Quadra Magic materia.

This sandy cave is empty, save for a blue pyramid-shaped object.  If you
examine it, you'll get a blue materia (Quadra Magic).

_________________________________________________________________________
NORTHWEST ISLAND  (Round Island)

Location:          Oval-shaped island surrounded by mountains and trees
                   that is in the northwestern part of the world.  It
                   is one of the Uncharted Isles (it doesn't show up on
                   the map).
How to get there:  Use a Gold Chocobo to fly to the island and climb
                   over the mountains.  Dismount and enter the cave
                   mouth that's at the edge of the forest.
Items to get:      Summon Knights of Round materia.

This may be another empty area, but the red pyramid lying by the tree
trunks is none other than the Knights of Round summon materia--the
most damaging summon spell in the entire game.  Simply examine it to
pick it up.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  6.4  yuffie's sub-quest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:          Town of Wutai.  You can go here in Disc 1 after
                   you get the Tiny Bronco, or you can do this in Disc 2,
                   once you have the Highwind or a colored Chocobo.  You
                   CANNOT do this in Disc 3, however.
How to get there:  Go to the southern end of the Westernmost Continent
                   using the Tiny Bronco, Highwind, a Chocobo, or a
                   Chocobo + the Highwind.  You MUST have gotten Yuffie
                   (though she doesn't have to be in the current party)
                   in order to perform this sub-quest.  You can also
                   land by Wutai and try to enter from there--you'll
                   still end up in the plains with Yuffie.
Items to get:      Hairpin, Magic Shuriken, MP Absorb materia, Swift
                   Bolt, Elixir x2, Dragoon Lance, Peace Ring, HP Absorb
                   materia, X-Potion, Turbo Ether, Ice Ring, All
                   Creation Manual, Leviathan materia.

After arriving at the southern tip of the Westernmost Continent, head
north.  There is a curving path that leads up to a high plateau.  As
you go along the curve (even if you are riding a Chocobo) you will be
interrupted by Yuffie.  The screen switches to that of a plain, and
Yuffie runs up, steals your Materia*, and escapes, but not before
leaving you with two Shinra guards to contend with!  The guards are
easily beaten, though.  If Yuffie was in your party when she tricked
you, you'll have to fight the guards only using two people (in which
case Barret will join the party afterwards, and if he's already in
your party, then whoever isn't being used will join.  Keep in mind that
you can rearrange the party in whatever way you'd like afterwards).

Note that if you have the Highwind, you're better off landing near Wutai,
then trying to enter the town (you'll still end up in the wilderness
area with Yuffie).  This is because you won't have to walk as far when
the quest is over).

* She can take 48-50 Materia (the number varies), and will steal them
  in this order of preference: Master Materia, Summon Materia,
  Independent Materia, Command Materia, Combination Materia and then
  Magic Materia.  This means that it is possible to be left with a few
  materia after she has escaped.  Note that if you're using the Materia
  Select Game Shark code and you have disabled Materia equipped/in your
  inventory, she'll steal them and you _won't_ get them back.

At this point, your characters will refuse to board the vehicle you
used to get here (Highwind, Tiny Bronco, or Chocobo), insisting that
they find Yuffie instead.  If you were on a Chocobo when Yuffie stole
your Materia, then you'll still be on it when the sequence ends, but
you won't be able to board the Highwind, and if you get off the Chocobo,
you can't get back on.  If you use the 'Start with Gold Chocobo' code,
then you can leave the island, but I don't know what happens if you do
this sub-quest while riding a real Gold Chocobo.  In any case, you can
use the Chocobo to cheat and simply ride all the way to Wutai, Yuffie's
hometown.  If you're not on a Chocobo, you'll have to walk.

From the curving path, head north until you cross a bridge, then go west
across a second bridge.  Head southeast once you reach the other side;
this leads to a north-bound path that runs under the bridge.  Follow it
and it will lead up to another bridge.  Past the bridge, the land
becomes flat and grassy.  Keep heading north and you'll arrive at Wutai.

When you enter the town, Yuffie will see you and run away.  Head to the
upper-left corner of town.  There's a path here that leads to a large
courtyard and a pagoda.  Enter the building to your right and walk along
the hall until you arrive at a room with a man sleeping inside.  Enter
it and talk to the man.  He is Godo, Yuffie's father.  Keep talking to
him until he stands up, at which point Yuffie will appear and then be
chased away by her father.  If you follow Yuffie, you'll find that she
has disappeared.  Before leaving this area, enter the room next to
Godo's and examine the right wall.  There is a hidden panel here that
will open, revealing a passage.  At the end of the passage is a chest
containing the Hairpin (a weapon for Red 13).  On your way out, go into
the room to the left of the entrance.  You can come here and spend the
night for free, but if you examine the scroll on the left wall, it will
lift up, revealing another passage.  The chest at the end of this
passage has a Magic Shuriken inside it.

Return to town and go into the eatery in the southwest corner of town.
The Turks are her!  Talk to them all (Elena, Rude, and Reno).  When
you are finished, go to the Item Shop.  Normally, there is a woman
standing in front of a treasure chest (preventing you from getting at
it) but now she will have moved away.  Open the chest and you'll get
a MP Absorb materia, but Yuffie will drop down from the ceiling and
swipe it from your hands!  Leave the shop and go to the southeast
edge of town.  There's a building here near the entrace.  Go inside
and examine the folding panel to the left.  Hiding behind it is Yuffie,
who dashes away as soon as she is discovered.  Chase her outside and
go to the eatery.  If you look at the jar standing outside the eatery,
you'll see that it is moving.  Approach it and press O to make your
friends block all the exits.  Then press O three times to make your
main character hit the jar until Yuffie jumps out.  Seeing that she
can't escape, she'll lead your characters to her house.

Meanwhile, two Shinra soldiers run into the eatery to meet with the
Turks.  After Elena leaves, you'll find your characters in Yuffie's
house.  When she goes downstairs, follow her.  I was sure that I found
an item in this room once, but I guess I was mistaken...anyway, don't
miss the Turtle's Paradise Flyer that's on the far wall when you go
downstairs.  Talk to Yuffie.  When you can move again, examine the
levers in the back room; you can pull the right lever or the left one.
It doesn't matter which one you choose, since either one will make
a cage drop on top of your allies!  Yes, Yuffie has tricked you again.
Examine either lever a second time to free your friends, then leave
the house.

Return to the courtyard area where the pagoda is and you'll see that
you can now enter the building to your left.  Climb up the steps and
examine the bell to ring it; this will reveal a hidden door.  Beyond
the door, you'll find Yuffie, who has been taken hostage by none other
than Don Corneo, the mohawked pervert that tricked you back in the
Wall Market.  He has captured Elena as well.  Before chasing after
him, open the chest to your right to find a Swift Bolt, and open
the chest to your left to get an Elixir.  Go up the stairs and you'll
find yourselves in the altar room back in Godo's house.  Three Shinra
soldiers appear and attack you, allowing Corneo to escape.  Kill the
guards (they're the same as the ones that attacked you back on the
curving path), then go outside.

Here, you'll run into Rude and Reno.  Talk to them, then return to town
and head to the northeastern corner of Wutai.  There's a path here that
leads up into the mountains, where huge Dachao statues have been carved
into the rock.  Talk to the Turks again as you follow the path, and keep
going along the path until it splits.  Take the path that goes north.
It leads past a huge head to a crossroads.  Rude is standing here,
blocking the entrace to a cave.  If you talk to him, he'll enter the
cave.  You can't get across the fire-pits yet unless you've gotten the
Leviathan Scales from the Junon Underwater Mako Reactor.  There's a
chest here that has a weapon for Cid in it, too (Dragoon Lance).  Talk
to Rude again and then exit the cave and head south to find Corneo,
who's tied Elena and Yuffie to the face of a Da-chao statue.  When you
confront him, he summons a boss to attack you.

BOSS TIPS: RAPPS                                LV: 39  HP: 6000  MP: 300

This winged beast isn't that tough, but unless you were able to hold onto
some Materia, all you can do is attack.  Use Phoenix Downs and Hi-Potions
or other restorative items to heal your party, and you may want to use
'attack' items like the Deadly Waste or Swift Bolt in order to inflict
damage along with your normal attacks.  Because of their high attack
power, Red 13 and Vincent make the best allies to have in this fight.  If
you think you can make it without Vincent assisting you, then use his
breaks to inflict lots of damage on the boss.  You'll recieve a Peace
Ring when the battle is finished.
_________________________________________________________________________

After the battle, Don Corneo will ask you a question and you have three
answers to choose from.  Pick any one you like.  Corneo threatens to
kill Yuffie and Elena, but then Reno and Rude show up and send Corneo
to his well-deserved demise.  Back at her house, Yuffie will give all
the materia she stole back to your characters (including the MP Absorb
materia).

You'll find yourself back in the World Map again, but I wouldn't leave
just yet if I were you.  Return to Wutai and enter the building near
Yuffie's house.  It's full of cats.  Normally, there's nothing you can
do here, but now you can climb up the steps in the back to find a
secret passage.  Walk north (towards the screen), to find a cat and a
chest.  Inside the chest is a HP Absorb materia.  Take it and go back
outside.

Now, head back to the courtyard.  Enter the pagoda and talk to the man
there, Goorikii.  He'll inform you that if she wishes, Yuffie can
fight by herself against the five guardians of the Pagoda of Five Strong.
Choose the top option to accept and the bottom option to decline.  After
each battle, go up the stairs and talk to the person there, picking the
top option to fight them and the bottom option to not fight them.  You
don't have to kill all the guardians in one go, and if Yuffie is killed
in battle, the game won't end, although she'll have zero HP and will
need to be revived before she can fight again.  Your enemies are:

First Floor: Gorky, a winged creature.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: GORKY                                LV: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 150
                                                (weak vs. Wind)

Use Haste on yourself, then use the Deathblow materia repeatedly in
order to inflict lots of damage.  Don't forget to heal yourself when
your life gets low.  The boss can use Barrier, but he's still easy to
defeat.  Yuffie gets an X-Potion once she's won the battle.
_________________________________________________________________________

Second Floor: Shake, a penguin-like monster.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: SHAKE                                LV: 32  HP: 4000  MP: 180

Use the same strategy that you used against Gorky.  You might try the
Barrier spell to reduce physical damage.  His 'Furious Bomber' attack
causes a lot of damage, but it will fill up your Limit Break bar very
quickly.  Yuffie will recieve an Turbo Ether when the fight ends.
_________________________________________________________________________

Third Floor: Chekhov, a four-armed foe.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: CHEKHOV                              LV: 34  HP: 5000  MP: 210

Keep your HPs up in case you get paralyzed.  Once again, using Haste,
Barrier, and then attacking with the Deathblow materia should do the
trick if your attack power is low.  Yuffie's prize for winning this
battle is an Ice Ring.
_________________________________________________________________________

Fourth Floor: Staniv, a creature swinging and iron ball.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: STANIV                               LV: 36  HP: 6000  MP: 240

Fight him the same way you fought Shake.  Without a doubt, the easiest
boss of the Pagoda.  If you win, Yuffie will get an Elixir from him.
_________________________________________________________________________

Fifth Floor: Godo, a three-headed monster.  Note that he will
             automatically attack you win you talk to him.

_________________________________________________________________________
BOSS TIPS: GODO                              LV: 41  HP: 10000  MP: 1000

Godo's attack style changes depending on which head is facing you.  He
has many attacks, including the Trine Enemy Skill and the ability to
drain your HP.  He will also use his supply of MP to heal himself for
around 1200+ points per use.  To beat him, deplete him MP supply by using
the Ghost Hand item or Magic Hammer Enemy Skill (you can learn it from
the Razor Weeds that live north of Wutai; they look like bunches of
grass).  The other way to beat him is simply Berserk yourself, assuming
you have enough HP and your attacks do over 1200 points of damage.  Your
only other tactic is to stay alive until he runs out of HP and then
attack him.  You'll get Yuffie's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (All Creation
once Godo is defeated.  If you got the Enemy Skill materia from the
Chocobo Sage and want to stick Trine on it, this is the only time you'll
be able to learn it, so don't miss out!

After Yuffie defeats Godo, he'll give you the Leviathan materia.
