v 2.5  (50+ tricks !)

Stupid FF thingies...

-In FF4j/2 if you get off a chocobo in a forest, only the chocobo's head will
run off
-In FF6j/3 the tent color changes in relation to who is the first member of the
party
-In FF7, you can turn around the chocobo figure with L1, R1 during choosing
screen
-In FFT, you can sometimes go through a red event on the map if you are lucky.

-----------

See what's going to be born (FFT)

On the editing screen, put an egg in the bottom row.  Place the cursur on top
and press right or left slowly or rapidly.  You should be able to get a glimpse
of fhe monster's face that's going to be born.

---------

HP full charge (FF7 US)  (contributed by Unright)

First you cast Regen on all, then all your enemy dies quickly open the
lid to the Playstation. it will be unable to load the victory dance
and will glitch a bit while you HP fills up. When at full health,
close the lid, your party will celebrate and the game will continue.

---

Duplicate Items (FF7 US, FF7 international)  (contributed by Suikoden)

You get the W-Item materia, equip it and when in battle, use a first
 item, click on the person/monster, at the second item (the one you'll
 duplicate), when you have chosen the person on who you want the item to
 go (without pressing O), cancel that command, re-do it and you'll see
 that you have 1 more of that item!

-------
Equip weird things (FF6j/ 3 us)

Only certain items can be equiped this way, and it's a bug.  To equip a Drill
as a hat...
1.  Sell all hats (or make sure you don't have any in your item box)
2.  Take off the hat of the person you want to equip the drill.  (sell that
hat, too.)
3.  In the item box, bring the drill to the right-bottom corner.
4.  Perform "strongest equip", and you can equip the drill as a hat.  (+255
armor!)
I don't remember what else you could equip...

-------

Warp 3 (FFA)

in the woods west of Wendel, there is one screen where a road runs west to
south and another road runds west to east on top of it.  On the bottom road,
face west.  Equip any ax and go to the western limit of the screen.  Make sure
your limit gage is NOT full and attack to the left, at the same time moving to
the left screen.  You'll warp to the snowy fields.

-------

Warp 4/5  (FFA)

in the last dungeon, there is a long zig-zag road.  On the top screen, stand on
the farthest place you can go without entering the forest-like place.  Repeat
the following until you go over the top of the screen and warp to the fire
cave.
1.  press up
2.  press "select" while you're moving one step.  (do this quickly)
3.  save, reset

Use this method in the entrance to snowy fields and you don't have to get off
the chocobo.  (you can even enter the cave with the chocobo)
-------

Superstrong GameG. code (FFA)

I figured this one myself by modification...

AFE-6B9-E62  (The problem is that it is stronger than the limitation of the
game, and the status will all go back to 99 after one level-up.)  (which is
still much stronger than the possible status you can get by regular play)

--------

*Get the Battle Ax from the beginning*  (FFL3)

When you go into the simulation battle in the very first thing in the game,
de-equip the battle-Ax of Mel-rose.  When you finish the battle, he will have
another equiped and you get to have the one you took out.

---------

*Listen to all music*  (FFT)

If you type "BGMkikitai" ("kikitai" in hiragana) as Ramza's name in the
Japanese version, you can go to the juke box mode and listen every music in the
game, including the unused ones.  Somebody please find the english name!! 
("BGM kikitai" means "I want to listen to the BGM")

-----------
*Stronger...  and stronger...*  (FFT)

After gaining levels on a character with high growth rate jobs (like ninja),
perform "level down" to them after changing into low growth rate jobs by
purposely going on to traps.  After going up to Lv 99, coming back to Lv 1, and
going up to Lv 99 again, the HP increase is up to 300!

--------
*Duplicate weapons* (FFT)

1.  Get a knight with the double-equipment ablitity.  (I don't know what it's
called, but it enables you to equip a weapon on each of the hands)
2.  Put a shield on the right, and equip the weapon you want to duplicate on
the left hand.
3.  Go to a shop where they only sell a weapons that are weaker than the weapon
you want to duplicate.
4.  Go to the changing-room, and perform the "equip strongest" (you know what
I'm talking abou, right?)
5.  De-equip your lefthand.
--------

**Avoiding Back-attacks** (FF7)
Press the "R" and "L" button for an instant.  (Don't press it long, for you
 will be running away)  The characters will be facing the enemy after releasing
 the buttons.  This will avoid double damage.
--------

Casting a magic three times on an enemy (FF7)
Make all of your characters "reflect" status.  Cast any attack magic into
all three of your characters, and the mgic will bounce three times to the
enemy, each with the attack power of a full magic.
----------

Recover your stamina in chocobo Race! (FF7)
Press R1 and R2 during chocobo race, and the stamina recovers gradualy. 
You must be the rider, though.
-----------

Get the dark crystal in the dwarf's castle (4j)
After Golbez's had steels the crystal, finish the chat with the king and
cast "degeon" without moving a step.  The crystal will strangely on the
platform waiting for you.  I don't know if it works on the US version.
---------

Final Fantasy Adventure (game boy):  Warp2
In the cave where you get the Ice magic,
go to the corner room right before you get the ice magic.
Equip a sword, and put your will to the max.
While sliding on the two plates, do the max-move to the right.
Press left when you're flying back, and keep pressing left.
You'll warp to the cave where you get the star.
-----------

Here's a little trick on FF2j
After you get the ring from Scott, press "select" and "B" at the same time to
call up a map.
---------

Bypass 4rth floor of Yuffie's event (FF7)
On the fourth floor on the tower in Utai, try to ignore the boss and go up
stairs.  He (the boss) will get mad, making a wall in front of you.  Go
back to 3rd floor once, and come back again.  You will be able to slip
through the door to the 5th floor.  (I'm not sure if it's on the US one)
----------

7777 attack (FF7)
Adjust your HP to 7777 in any point of the game.  (during battle or in the
status window, it doesn't matter)  The character will go out of controll
and start giving the enemy 7777 rapidly. (When you start the battle, if
your HP is already 7777)  Unfortunately, your HP goes down to "1" after battle.
--------------

*Infinite money/item*  (FF5j)Preparation:
1.  Have one ninja and one thief in your party.  (Lenna looks really good with
 pony tailed ninja)
2.  Have two weapons that the ninja can equip.  (Two.  not more, not less)
3.  Find an enemy that you can steal an item that is usable during battle. 
 (like potion)4.  Discard (or sell) all of the item.5.  Refresh your item box
6.  Equip one of the two weapons onto the ninja.  Leave one hand blank.
Instructions
1.  Go into battle, and make sure that the enemy you can steal usable items is
 there.2.  Wait for ninja's turn, and go to "item", and click the other weapon.
3.  Bring your cursur up to the equip box (just keep pressing up) and click on
 the empty hand.  (in other words, equip the weapon)
4.  Go back to the menu for the ninja, and choose "throw".
5.  Click on the space you have just made by removing the weapon.
6.  Pick the enemy that you want to steal from.
7.  A yellow light will be thrown, with 0 damage.
8.  Wait for thief's turn, and steal the item from the enemy.  (keep trying)
9.  After you steal the item, quickly use it to anyone.10.  Finish the battle.
Results:Your item should have a weird symbol next to it.  It means that you
have
 infinite of it.  Use it ONE BY ONE for infinite use, or sell it ONE BY ONE to
 increase your money.  Steal "golden needles" for best money.  (no, I don't
 remember which enemy had it)Notes:
If you perform "refresh", the items will turn into only 99 of them.  (only...)
Asign a corner key in the keyboard as "A", and tape it down to sell
 continuously in emulatorsLeave it for some time, and your money will zoom up.
Cast heiste to the thief to steal items quicker.  (Or have 3 thiefs and 1
 ninja.)
There is a similar trick in FF2 (4j), so if you want me to post it, just e-mail
 me.  (click my signature at the bottom : )
---------

Speed 255 !  (JAP version FF7 only)
Equip two "double item" materias, and your speed will go up to 255.  (probably
 a bug)
----------

Get 100 GP for 10000 G (FF7)
When you go back and forth Gold S entrance and the Ropeway entrance, there
is a chance that a man is standing in the back corner of the Gold S
entrance.  Talk to him, and he'll sell you one GP for 100 G.  (100 GP is
the maximum)  The chance is low, so keep trying.  Until you grow your own
chocobos, this is the fastest and the most accurate way to earn GP.  
(Well, the FASTEST is the basket ball game...)
----------

30,000 in Speed Square (FF7 jp version only?)
Sometime after the balloons come out, there are two big yellow airships
that are not enemies, on the right near the top.  Shoot the propeller
portion of the airship (on the behind), and the scores zoom up. 
(apparantly a bug)  The score gage will brake, but the score will keep on
rising if you keep on shooting.  The maximum score is 30000, because
anything past 30,000 will go back to a zero.
--------

I'll focus on "did you know..." type things today.(FF7)
Did you know...
that you can see a TV add (FMV) in the Sinra building, at the shop?
that you can really buy the Costa Del Sol house?
that the man in the cave (near Junon) will give you items when the last
two digits of your number of fights match?
that you can use "regist" in a controled enemy to make them stay controlled?
(or make they stay sleeping)
---------

**EXP to dead characters** (FF7)
If you put a dead (unable to fight) character out of your party, 1/2 EXP points
earned will
go to the dead character, too.  (If the dead character levels up, he/she will
come back alive)

---------

**Tifa and Cid rides the chocobo races**
In random, when Cloud decides to join a race, Tifa or Cid asks you if
he/she can be the rider.

---------

**The Dead rises by being stabbed by needles in the wall** (long...) (US?)
In the trap in the dungeon in Cosmo Canyon, the dead will re-vive with HP1.
(and no, this isn't for reviving Aeris)
---------

Equip anything that could be stolen!! (FF2, 4j)
Prepare by setting the battle to active mode.
Give command to Edg eto steal from the enemy, and wait with the item
window open until he steals a weapon or a sheild.  After the item comes
into the window, click it and bring it to the top to equip.  Even
Rydia/Rosa can equip shields this way.  Here's a list of good weapons to
steal from enemies:  (I translated from the Japanese enemies, so the name
might be a little different)Riris' Rod:  RirisDragon's Lance:  Blue Dragon
Brake Blade:  Black LizardLune Ax:  Giant Soldier, Magic Soldier
Lune Staff:  Marionater
----------

Today's is on FF3 (FF6j)Instant killer
Tired of fighting bosses?  Two simple steps will terminate all enemies
except for "undead" monsters.  (like skeleton, zombie, ghost, etc)
1.  Make the enemy invisible.  (magic, item, etc)2.  Cast Death.
That's it!  It works on all living bosses except for Kefka and the 3 gods.
PS:  I totally changed the design of my page (down below)
-----------

Make Terra stay as an esper (FF3, 6j)
1.  transform Terra into an esper
2.  Make her sleep
3.  Hit her and wake her.
----------

Today's secret will be of Final Fantasy 2 (4j).  It's a popular one.
Equip and multiply your weapon or shield!
1. During battle, go to the item box and select an open space.
2. Scroll up, and click on the weapon/shield you want to multiply
3. Run away or finish the battle quickly.
4. Go to "equip" and equip the weapon you had just de-equipped.
5.  Wow!  the character is equipping two things!  de-equip it to make it
two separate items.
You can divide any weapon/shield, for an unlimited time.  Use this for
making money, too.
----------

Day 2  (FF1) I know it's an old game...
Do you like mini games?  Press "A+B" 55 times on the boat, and a mini game
to organize 15 numbers come out.
-----------

Cross the swamp without a chocobo. (FF7)
Walk into the swamp south of the Chocobl Farm.  Usually, the Midgal Snake
would swirl it's way towards you, but before he can catch you, save and
reset.  (hold R1 R2 L1 L2 Start Select)  When you load the game, Midgal
Snake will be a lot farther than you.  Do this 2, 3 times to cross the
swamp without a chocobo!
------------

Getting the mountain/river chocobo:  (green/blue) (FF7)
breed two "good" or "pretty good" chocobos with "karab" seed.  (the chances of
 getting a special chocobo increases when the parants are high in rank.  (in
 chocobo races)Getting the black chocobo (black)
breed a mountain chocobo and a river chocobo with any seed.  (the higher priced
 ones are better)Getting the ocean chocobo (gold)
Breed a black chocobo with a "marvelous" chocobo.  (Maybe it was "splendid" or
 something, but it's the best one)  With a "zeio" seed.Getting the Karab seed:
Steal or kill the dinosour near bone village.Getting the Zeio seed:
Steal or kill goblins in "goblin island", in the north east.
Getting chocobuckle (bonus)
Give a memit's veggie to a chocobo with a level with a multiple of 4.  (ex:  4,
 8, 16)  Cast "LV4 blast" to the chocobo.  Give a memit's veggie to the
 chocobo.  Cast "LV4 blast".  Keep on doing this until the chocobo does
 "chocobuckle".  (Be sure to equip the "enemy skills" materia.  The
 chocobuckle's strength depends on how many times you have run away from
 battles.  It only takes up 3 MP, so it's suited for people who want to zoom
 through the game, running away a lot.Turning the chocobo (bunos)
when you're in the screen where you need to choose the chocobo to give veggies,
 press "R" or "L" to turn them
Chocobo has more HP than the last boss.  The last boss will die when using
 "Knights of Round" with 9999 damage each, with "double-magic" materia while a
 chocobo won't die.  (who cares?)
-----------

Getting the quad-magic materia without a special chocobo: (FF7)
Go to the cliff leading to the cave near Mideal, with the high-wind. 
Enable the "bird view", and line up the airship with the cliff, so that the
cave is on the left side.  Press SQUARE and LEFT as you lower the airship
with "X" button.  The timing is critical, but You will land on the left
side of the cliff if you succeed.  Just press A in the buttom of the cliff
to get up.  If you are on a chocobo, (any chocobo) it's easier to succeed.
------------

Here's a little FF2 (4j) trick:
Choose "sing" during frog status, and the song will be "frog's song".  It
will turn the enemy into frogs.
------------

Snowboard Complete Guide  ( in gold S.) (FF7)

Control tips:-Obst. Course
Try to be in the middle, and brake if too fast, because falling down is a
deduction of one point.  Red balloons are 1 point, Blue 2 point, and Green
3 point.  Some balloons can be get by jumping only.  A 90 will grant you an
item. (once only)-Time Attack
ALWAYS keep your finger on R1, to activate sharp turning.  Try to keep the
inside, but turning sharp turns from the outside into the inside.  Try
moving as little as possible.Course Tips-1st course
Keep on the left side at first.  Pass in a straight line un the snake
curves.  In the big jump, approach from the right and press left just as
you are about to jump.  Try to go straight in the wide road, in the middle.
 Jump with a high speed to get the green balloon.-2nd course
If you get the speed up, do not turn widely in the curves connecting the
caves.  You will spin out.  Instead, release the right button for a short
amount of time during the turn.-3rd course
Keep the middle in the beginning, while going slow in the caves at the
edge.  Try to remember the big rock, if you are in the obstacle.  (and the
blue baloon right after the cave)  Practice is the only key to getting a
fast time on this course : )
