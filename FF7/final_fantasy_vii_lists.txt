Final Fantasy VII is copyright Square/Squaresoft Please do not leech any 
of this to make your own FAQ out of it. Unless you have MY permission DO 
NOT take anything at all from this guide. Don't edit, don't do anything to 
it and submit it without e-mailing me with permission first. You can
print it out, but only for personal use, no selling this! Summing it
up, do anything for your own personal benefit (apart from reading it)
without asking me, AND YOU'LL BURN IN HELL!!!!!

To get in touch, e-mail me at shinra9@yahoo.com.
My ICQ# is 34601221.

Be warned that I'm only on the net twice a week, don't expect replies 
from me which are ten minutes after you've sent the mail. Here's some 
guidelines about sending me mail:

1.Make sure you put the title of the game you're asking about in the
  subject. I've made a fair few FAQs, and it's a bit hard to work 
  things out sometimes.
  
2.If it's an FAQ, make sure that it's not already in the guide!!! If
  it is, I'll do my best to ignore it.
  
  If it's not in there, make sure that the details you provide 
  are, well, DETAILED, and not sketchy. Examples are "Hi need to know
  how to get past this part, i'm in a room and stuck", I need to know
  where you are, etc.
  
3.Ask nicely. So far, most people have, but if your mail goes along
  the lines of "Hi, need code for B2, reply within the next hour 
  otherwise I'll bomb you" will not get you anywhere.
  
That's it. Sorry for being a pain, but it had to be said.

1)Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea to make a FFVII Lists Guide came to me one day when I was 
looking at the FFVII stuff at GameFAQs. I decided that the public 
could use my expertise.

...cough, cough, *LOSER*, cough, cough...

Anyway, enough ego bashing. I saw epic walkthroughs by Kao, 
Dingo, so I thought, hey, instead of writing another uneeded 
walkthrough, how about a big, comprehensive Monster/Item/Materia 
List? Enjoy!

Found at North Corel, after the Train Ride. If you successfully
saved the town, a little kid will give this to you for free (the one
that said that he found something shiny at the bottom of the well).
If not, you can buy it off the same little kid for 50000. However,
if you fail to make it to the train, no Ultima for you!

From Chris Seroya:

If you add a materia combos guide, please add this materia setup. 
It's my special setup which won me the game with extreme ease. Oh 
yeah, and give all the "source" items to Cloud, since he's the main
character and is always in your party. For most of the game anyways.

Cloud - Ultima Weapon
         Mystile
         Ribbon

Materia - mp turbo-ultima final attack-phoenix doublecut-mime
           hpplus-counterattack

           counter attack for the rest of the slots

Yuffie - Conformer
          Mystile
          Ribbon

Materia - same setup as shown above

Tifa - Premium Heart
        anything with six slots that has high evade and magic evade %
        anything you want

Unless you cheat, you can only have two Mystiles and Ribbons. The 
reason for no MP Pluses is because Ultima will give your character 
full MP, guaranteed. The reason for no Restore is because when you 
get W-Item, you can make more of an item. The trick is as follows:

1. Have W-Item equipped on a character, doesn't matter who, don't 
have any characters with Counter Attacks, you'll soon see the reason
why. Go into a battle with weak monsters. Make sure you have at least
one of the item you want to make more of. Also, have at least one
other item.

2. Select W-Item on the menu. Click the item you want to make more 
of and use it. Next, select any other item and cancel it. You should 
have one more of the original item selected. Keep selecting and 
canceling the second item and pow, instant 99 of some item.

3. The only requirement to this is the item MUST be usable in battle. 
Megalixers are my favorite to multiply. I won't need any other item.

See now why you don't need Restore until you get W-Item? A great 
trick to use to sell items. Try buying an expensive item such as 
Sylkis Greens or Ethers. Multiply them and instant cash for the Coin 
command or if you need to buy some extra supplies.

The reason to choose Yuffie is because the Conformer is powered up 
(more damage) if the monster she's fighting is stronger than her. The 
reason for Tifa is her limit break. Seven limits for one use is worth 
the weak attack power. Trust me on this.

To get Yuffie, walk around in forest areas in the Junon area until
you fight her. When you can control yourself again, don't use the 
save point, instead, talk to Yuffie. If you touch the save point 
Yuffie will awaken and steal cash from you. When you get to choose
some options, for the first option, pick the top one (I tihnk). After
that pick the bottom one, then the top one, etc.

The reason for only one magic materia is because Ultima is the best
f**king magic attack in the game. 9999 damage for me when Cloud uses
it, or anyone else for that matter when it's attatched to MP Turbo.

Doublecut is for when you fight just one guy. When there is multiple
guys on the screen, use Ultima. I'll add the link to an awesome save
game editor. It's called ff7che.zip. It's very easy to spot because
in bold letters is written, "THIS IS A GREAT EDITOR". Hehe, and it
is. The link: http://www.davestavern.iwarp.com/stuff.html There you 
go.

There are tons more things I can add, like where to get all the
enemy skills, the locations of the ultimate weapons and how they do
more damage, a materia list with locations, MP use and stuff like 
that, but it'll make this email the size of someone's FAQ! Haha! 
I truly am that good. Mwahahahahahaha! Have fun with this great game.

Another FF7 tip: for major experience, AP, gil, and to learn limit 
breaks quickly and easily, got to the Mideel area after you get the 
Tiny Bronco. I got everybody over level 50, I mastered tons of materia,
I learned all my learnable limit breaks for everyone, and I ended up with
loads of gil. All you need is an enemy skill with Aqualung or Beta. 
Aqualung can be learned by fighting Harpies in the desert after getting 
the buggy. Beta can be learned from the Midgar Zolom in the marsh, the 
one you had to cross with the chocobo. You know, the one with the long 
snake thing following you when you cross it? IDIOTS!!! THE CHOCOBO 
FARM!!! Heh. Sorry about that. Anyways, after getting those two enemy 
skills, go to the Mideel area. Yes, I know the enemies here are really 
hard to beat, but they give loads of experience, AP, and gil. Especially
the head hunters, which you will fight most commonly on the little grassy
peninsula (almost every battle). Odin works great too. Be sure to have 
lots of tents and hypers. Hypers work well when you have to use limit
breaks to learn the next one. A good place to stock up on supplies to 
survive this place is the Wutai area. The enemies there will give Phoenix 
Downs and X-Potions. It's that easy to learn limits and gain levels and AP 
at the same time. The best place for this stuff is at the Northern Crater 
in the third disk. The Magic Pots and Movers there will give loads of AP.
Be sure to have plenty of elixirs to feed the pots. You have to feed them 
elixirs to be able to hurt them. The only place you will fight these 
enemies is the left path, and then the upper path. You'll know what I mean
when you get there. Hopefully. Lol. Also, be sure to have the Apocolypse
and the Scimitar, they have triple growth AP. The Apocolypse is in the 
Ancient Forest, which you can reach after killing the Ultima Weapon, or
with a Black, Blue or Gold Chocobo. Or was it Black, Green, and Gold. Oh 
well. The Ancient Forest is near Cosmo Canyon. As for the Huge Materia sub
quests, if you don't want to do them, at least successfully finish the one
at North Corel. You can get the Ultima materia for free, and you can also
get the extreme limit manual for Barret. Also, do the Fort Condor one as
well. You get Phoenix materia if you beat it. That's all for now.

The Midgar Key is just under the nose of the airplane. Search for good 
treasure and tell them to dig under the nose of the wrecked plane. Keep 
racing at the chocobo square to get special items from Ester. Fianl Attack - 
Revive doesn't always work. Final Attack may not kick in. Mega All sucks if 
you have a Double Materia equipped as it will cancel out those effects and 
put in the slash all command in place of attack.

There is also a special condition in FF7 where you always do 7777 damage.
It's called Lucky Sevens. When someone's HP is at 7777, they will act like
they're berserked and will always do 7777 damage, no matter what special 
defenses the enemy has. 


LOTS MORE COMING SOON!
