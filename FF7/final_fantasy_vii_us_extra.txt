  Barrier protects you from physical attacks, MBarrier does the same
  in regards to magical attacks, and Reflect will bounce back a spell
  cast on you.  Note that two characters with Reflect can bounce a
  spell back between them for a long time.  Wall acts like Barrier
  plus MBarrier.

  than that of Comet.

  Causes Ice, Earth, Wind, or Fire-element damage x4.  Freeze also has a
  10% percent chance of causing 'Paralyze', Break can cause 'Petrify',
  and Tornado can cause 'Confusion'.  This materia has a great secondary
  use if used along with the Added Effect materia, allowing you to
  attack and hit with these status conditions.  It's _especially_ good
  if you use the Master Command trick (see below) as well.

  double damage (50% chance of it hitting).  You can ensure that it
  hits by giving your character a weapon with high accuracy (Vincent's
  Shortbarrel has a 255 accuracy, which is the highest possible score.
  He'll never miss a Deathblow attempt!)  +1 bonus to Luck when worn.

  Control and command one enemy.  The neat thing about this is that a
  manipulated enemy has a Dexterity rating of zero, so even the
  quickest enemy (like the cactus men in the Corel Prison or the other

  time.

  When equipped, you can use the same commands that you could use with

  materia WITH either of these materia, allowing you to, for example,
  use the Morph ability with Slash All, or use Mug with Double Cut.

  Imitate the last action performed (recast spells, Limit Breaks, etc.)

  you can only mimic your own Limit Breaks.  Very useful in that a
  mimicked action costs no MP, etc.--it's a free usage.

  usable in battle.  To duplicate an item, select the one you want a
  copy of, then select any other item.  Cancel that item, then choose

  When worn, you can attack from the back row with no penalty.  You can
  also attack out-of-reach enemies (usually the flying sort), with
  close-range weapons.  This materia will affect all 'target' materia
  as well, allowing you to Morph or Steal from normally out of range
  enemies, for example.

  Negates the 20-minute time limit when fighting the Emerald Weapon.
  You can get as many of these as you want (as long as you have Guide
  Books), and since you can store an infinite number of AP on this
  materia, it's really handy to sell for money or to give to characters
  who benefit from having high AP amounts (like Barret and his Missing
  Score weapon).

 Note that the DOUBLE CUT and SLASH-ALL materia cannot be supported
 unless you use my trusty Master Command trick (see the Master Command
 materia entry for more info.)

                                                crossroads' path.
  After using the materia that this is combined with, your character
  will make a single physical attack against the enemy targeted by
  the previous materia use (a random target is chosen if the materia
  affected a random or all targets).  Don't link this to a materia you
  can use on your allies, or you'll attack them.  Can support any magic,
  command, or summon materia.

  If this materia and the materia it is connected to are attached to
  your weapon, any attack you make can inflict the ailment of the
  attached materia (i.e. equip Poison, and when you attack an enemy,
  you may be able to poison them).  If both materia are attached to
  your armor, you are protected from the status ailment that materia
  can inflict (using the previous example, you'd be immune to poisonous
  attacks).  Can support Mystify, Poison, Seal, Time, Transform,
  Destruct, Contain, Choco/Mog, Hades, and Odin.  Note that this can
  be used to bypass certain limitations; for example, you can turn
  a flying enemy into a frog by attaching Transform or Hades to your
  weapon (this isn't normally possible).

  Level 5       5 times         35000           Fort Condor (Disc 2-3)

  You can change the range of the attached materia so that it affects
  all targets instead of one.  The tradeoff is that the power of that
  materia decreases.  You can make sure to only target one enemy by
  pressing R1 when targetting the attached materia.  This materia works
  outside of battle, too.  Can support Restore, Heal (Poizona/Esuna),
  Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Poison, Gravity, Seal, Mystify, Time,
  Barrier, Destruct, and FullCure.

  Level 5       +100%           200000

  Wearing this will make your character counterattack with the attached
  materia.  Can support any command materia except Enemy Skill and
  Master Command.

  Level 4       --              80000

  This works just like the 'Added Effect' materia, but it effects
  elemental damage types.  Equip it to your weapon along with a materia
  and you can attack and cause elemental damage.  Equip it to your armor
  and you are defended from that sort of element.  Can support Fire,
  Ice, Lightning, Earth, Poison, Gravity, Choco/Mog, Ifrit, Shiva,
  Ramuh, Titan, Leviathan, Phoenix, Alexander, Bahamut, Neo-Bahamut,
  Bahamut Zero.

  *  These apply to armor only.  The element will do half damage to you,
     then no damage at level 2, and at level 3, you will gain back HP
     equal to the damage that would have been inflicted by that element
     attack.

  When an ally wearing this is killed, they will use the connected
  materia before dying.  The power of the materia will always be the
  strongest one available.  This materia can only be used so many
  times per battle.  Note that it doesn't always work, either.  A
  smart tactic is to attach this to the Revive or Phoenix materia so
  that you'll be protected from dying.  Works with any materia!

  If the connected materia can inflict damage on an enemy, 1/10th of
  that damage is given back to you in the form of HPs.  Can support
  Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Poison, Gravity, Meteorite, Contain,
  Ultima, Steal (Mug), Deathblow, Manipulate, Morph, Throw, Slash-All,
  Double Cut, Master Command, Mimic (if you mimicked something that did

  materia, always casting the best possible spell level available.  Can
  support any magic or summon materia.

  If the connected materia can inflict damage on an enemy, 1/10th of
  that damage is given back to you in the form of MPs.  Can support
  Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Poison, Gravity, Meteorite, Contain,
  Ultima, Steal (Mug), Deathblow, Manipulate, Morph, Throw, Slash-All,
  Double Cut, Master Command, Mimic (if you mimicked something that did

  Level 5       +50%            120000

  When attached to a materia, the standard MP cost increases. However,
  that spell becomes more effective by a certain percentage as well.
  Can support any Magic or Summon materia, and the Enemy Skill materia.

 QUADRA MAGIC   effect:         ap needed:      can find/buy at:

  When you cast any spell, summon, or enemy skill, it will be cast four
  times in succession with no increase in MP cost.  However, you cannot
  pick your targets for the successive castings, and the effectiveness
  of the spell, skill, or summon drops by 2/5ths.  Can support any
  Magic and Summon materia (except Knights of the Round), and the Enemy
  Skill materia.

  Level 5       +80%            150000

  When worn, the person with this materia equipped has a percent chance
  of stepping forward before the first round has begun and using the
  attached materia.  This effect functions regardless of Pre-Emptive
  or Ambush-style battles.  The target of the attached materia is
  always chosen at random, and the CPU will always make your character
  use the best ability he has (Coin instead of Throw, Cure 3 instead of
  Cure 2, etc.)  Note that there is a direct relation between your
  Dexterity level and the success rate of this materia.  Wearing a
  Speed Plus materia, or an accessory that increases Dexterity, will
  make this materia more effective.  Can support any spell, command, or
  summon materia, excluding anything that causes the 'Slash-All' effect.

  After using the materia that this is combined with, your character
  will make one Steal attempt against the enemy the previous materia
  targeted (it works like 'Added Cut').  Can support any magic, command,
  or summon materia.

   Sephiroth is kinda useless since he already has one.

  7.3  shopping list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is a list of each shop in the game and what you can purchase
there.  Please keep the following notation in mind:

Bracelet    - a bracelet anyone can wear.  'd' means 'Defense Power'
              and the number afterwards shows what your defense power
              will be changed to if this bracelet is equipped.  Next
              to that is a number and a letter; this indicates the
              number of Materia holders and whether they are single
              (s), or combined (c).
Weapon      - a weapon.  The name next to it indicates who can wield
              it.  'a' means 'Attack Power' and the number afterwards
              shows what your attack power will be changed to if this
              weapon is carried.  Next to that is a number and a
              letter; this indicates the number of Materia holders and
              whether they are single (s), or combined (c).  'None'
              means that that weapon has no Materia holders.

All the statistics below apply to all three discs.  If the goods for
sale or prices change from one disc to the next, then it will say
'(location) - DISC #' afterwards, which is why a location may be listed

what you can win from it, where it's found at, and other information,

This section was based on a document written by someone from the Final
Fantasy 7 Database Index (sp?) which was originally in Japanese.  Thanks
to WhisQ for rewriting the list!  Aside from the SOLDIER classes, names
that are capitalized indicate monsters who's stats WhisQ isn't sure of.

_____________________________________________  LAST BATTLE WITH SEPHIROTH
<No Name>  (Sephiroth)
  LV: ??          EXP: n/a         Steal: n/a

  Attacks: (sword attack)
  Notes: You can only attack him using Cloud's Level 4 Limit Break
         (even if you don't have it yet).  Even an attack that does
         0 points of damage will kill him (via a GameShark :)).
         Sephiroth cannot kill you, even if you let him strike first.
         And if he does, you will automatically counterattack.
         There's no way to lose this battle, in other words.

  7.5  game shark code list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   You need a Game Shark or a Pro Action Replay with version 1.98
   software or later.  Some of these codes don't work on a PAR, I don't
   know why.  Don't forget to enter the Master Code (80000000 - 0000)
   first.

CHARACTER SELECT - 3RD POSITION                           8009CBDE - FF0x
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter this code, but replace the last digit with one of the following:

        x = 0  -  Cloud Strife
            1  -  Barret Wallace
            2  -  Tifa Lockheart
            3  -  Aeris Gainsborough
            4  -  Red 13
            5  -  Yuffie Kisaragi
            6  -  Cait Sith         (sometimes, Young Cloud)
            7  -  Vincent Valentine (sometimes, Sephiroth)
            8  -  Cid Hiwind
            9  -  <Young Cloud>
            A  -  <Sephiroth>
            B  -  <Chocobo>
            C  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)
            D  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)

When you turn on the code, the character in the 3rd position will turn
into whatever character you specified.  You may want to go into the
PHS menu, turn off the code, and put the character in/out of the PHS
groups a few times to 'debug' it a bit.  When you return to the Main
Menu screen, that person will have the portrait/stats. of the desired
character.

It is HIGHLY recommended that you have the 3rd space EMPTY when you
use this code as in some cases, a preexisting character may overlap
with the selected one.  The result is that, when you enter a battle,
that character does not appear, cannot interact, and his/her HP drops
steadily until it hits zero.

Using this code:

Characters all start off at their 'base' level (1).  If you use this
code to get a character that you don't have at the moment (say picking
Aeris while in Disc 2 or 3), they'll have the same stats and abilities
as they did when you last had them in your party.  If you level them
up, change their equipment, etc., then save the game and use the code
to replace them with another character and put them back in, any changes
you made will be saved, too.  Note that if you use this code to get a
character you already have (say, if Cid is in the 3rd position and you
put in the code for Cid), you'll get multiple copies of the character.
This also happens if you have the code on while you try to pull a
character in/out of the active group.  Copied characters disappear when
you exit the PHS menu.  This code also has a chance of starting up the
'error checker' feature (see the 'Super Select' code for details).

Yes, if you save the game, you save the added characters.  The only way
to remove them is to use the code to 'select' a new character, or to
put them in PHS (inactive party) and then return to your Main Menu.
Also note that sticking a 'selected' character in the first position
will make Cloud disappear on-screen (you can still use the cursor).

Finally, note that if you enter a conversation/event with a character
you're not supposed to have (say, Sephiroth outside of the flashback
or Aeris after Disc 1), the game may (and probably will) crash.  The
only exception to this are the 'general' quotes which a character will
say automatically, regardless of who he/she is.

Specific Character info.:

Both Cloud and Aeris become 'permanent' members of either your active
party or the inactive party.  To remove them, you'll have to stick
them in the third position (use Order), and put in a code for one of
your normal characters.

Sephiroth is still controlled by the computer, although you can take or
change his equipment and Materia.  As he only has one weapon (Masamune),
using the 'Item Select' code to have this item is useless as it's the
only weapon he can equip.  Although it will act as if he and Young Cloud
have Limit Breaks, they don't in actuality (if you look, you'll see
that it's Vincent's and Cait's Breaks instead).

This code has trouble realizing who is Cait Sith/Young Cloud and who
is Vincent/Sephiroth, because of the way the characters' data is
stored.  As a result, you may not always get the character you want
when trying to get either of these characters.

The 'Chocobo' and 'Now Printing' are not real characters.  They have
no weapons, statistics, etc. (if you look, you'll see that they
borrow the stats. of another character, usually your leader).  If you
try to enter a battle with one of them in your party, you get the
'overlap' result described above (as they are not playable).


ITEM SELECT                                               8009CCxx - yzzz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please take note:  As long as you follow the below guidelines (remember
to be careful when putting in the two 'location' digits), this code
should work.  Several people have been complaining that they can't get
the code to work--even the people with the same GS and version number
as mine (1.98).  If you've _carefully_ tried this code and can't get any
results, then you may simply not be able to use the code on your game.
I have NO IDEA what causes this and I'm sorry I can't offer more help to
those with problems concerning this code or the Materia Select code
(they both work in the same manner).

And yes, saving your game with this code _will_ save the items into
memory--you'll still have to be careful that you don't end up with the
'battle' glitch' described below (although it seems as if it's not in
the English version).

An example code would be 8009CCA8 - 202A for the Ghost Hand item, for
those of you who don't understand how the x/y/z entries work.

xx = Location where item appears on the Item Select Screen.  You can
     change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
     multiple items of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
     (i.e. C2, 9A, or 88) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
     would put an item over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
     game may freeze or the item may not appear.  Finally, try to keep
     the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

  y = No. of items; you'll have an infinite amount unless you turn
      the switch off (usually).  The number you enter is converted
      to hexidecimal form (so what you put in won't correlate with
      the # of items you get).  Keep in mind that 0 is a valid
      number and can be used.

 -   Codes ending in 069 - 07F give you these items.  As of right now,
     I don't know what their purpose is (they may be disabled Key
     Items, I think).
 -   Codes ending in 080 - 08F are swords for Cloud.
 -   Codes ending in 090 - 09F are claws for Tifa.
 -   Codes ending in 0A0 - 0AF are cannons for Barret.
 -   Codes ending in 0B0 - 0BD are combs for Red XIII.
 -   Codes ending in 0BE - 0C8 are rods for Aeris.
 -   Codes ending in 0C9 - 0D6 are spears for Cid.
 -   Codes ending in 0D7 - 0E4 are shurikens for Yuffie.
 -   Codes ending in 0E5 - 0F1 are M-phones for Cait Sith.
 -   Codes ending in 0F2 - 0FE are handguns for Vincent.
     The code ending in 0FF looks like a gun, but it is in
     fact Sephiroth's Masamune blade.
 -   Codes ending in 100 - 11F are defensive bracelets.
 -   Codes ending in 120 - 13F are accessories you equip.
 -   Codes ending in 140 - FFF are 'glitch' items that don't exist
     and have no purpose/effect on the game.

In the Japanese version of FF7, having 'selected' items in your inventory
would cause an 'error checker' to appear (see it's description under the
'Super Select' code listing).


MATERIA SELECT                                            8009D0xx - 00yy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well well!  Here's an interesting code.  It works very much like the
Item Select code above, except that you have to go into the Materia
Screen.  As long as the switch is up, you have an infinite number of
whatever Materia you've selected.  The only bad thing about this code
is that it will sometimes start off the Materia orbs with 'beyond master'
levels, meaning that you can use all their abilities, but you can't get
another one by mastering it.  According to Mr. DeLucas, this is because
of their position (so if you want a materia with lots of AP, find a
code/position that works and remember it).

xx = Location where the materia appears on the Materia Menu.  You can
     change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
     multiple materia of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
     (i.e. A0, C4, or 86) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
     would put a materia over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
     game may freeze or the materia may not appear.  Finally, try to
     keep the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

*   Codes ending in 16, 26, 3F, 42 and 43 are 'disabled' Materia that
    you can't normally get during the game.  In the Japanese game,
    they were still usable, but their abilities, descriptions, and
    other stats. have been removed/altered in this release.

    Note that the Underwater materia has been made into a
    real, usable Materia!  It's not used to revive Aerith, but to
    explore more of the underwater areas (and fight the underwater
    Weapon monster).

**  Starts off with a variable number of stars (usually missing the
    first eight or stars 3, 6, and 7).

 - Codes ending in 00 - 0D, 10 and 12 are Independant Materia.
 - Codes ending in 0E, 0F and 17 - 23 are Combination Materia.
 - Codes ending in 13 - 15, 24, 25, 27 - 2C and 30 are Command Materia.
 - Codes ending in 31 - 3E, 40, 41, and 44 - 49 are Magic Materia.
 - Codes ending in 4A - 5A are Summon Materia.
 - Codes ending in 2D - 2F, 89 are game glitches and not real Materia.
 - However, equipping the '089' materia will raise most of your stats.
   to 255 and your MAX MP to 999, although your HP will be dramatically
   reduced.
 - All other codes (5B - FF, excluding 89) are game glitches and not
   real Materia.

For information on the disabled materia, refer to part 2 of my Japanese
FF7 FAQ.  However, here is a quick explanation:

 16 - Booster : A Support materia with no use.
 26 - Law     : A Command materia with the Throw and Coin abilities.
 3F - MBarrier: A Magic materia with the MBarrier spell (3 levels).
 42 - Reflect : A Magic materia with the Reflect and Wall spells.
 43 - Rifuabu : A Magic materia with the Wall spell (3 levels).

 and....

  11 - Underwater Breath : An Independent materia with no use.  This
       was made into a real, usable materia called 'Underwater' in the
       US version.


SUPER SELECT                                              800F389E - 0xxx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:  As far as I know, you have to enter this in your Comms Link and
turn it on in-game in order for the code to work.  It _will not_ work
with a normal GameShark, as far as I know.  Even with a Comms Link, I'm
having trouble getting it to work (if you can only use Turbo Ethers or
Phoenix Downs, the code isn't behaving properly, BTW).

Basically, this code will let you do just about anything in battle.  It
works like this:

 - Use an item, and it will become whatever item you specified in terms
   of effect.  You do lose one of whichever item you selected, though.

 - Cast a spell, and the spell will instead be the one specified.  The
   amount of MP you lose is determined by the spell you selected via
   this code, not the one you chose in the spell menu.  This also
   applies to using Summons and Enemy Skills.

 - Manipulate an enemy, and you can choose which power you want it to
   use, even ones that aren't listed.

 - Assuming the game doesn't crash :), you can enter an 'error checker'
   mode that allows you to exit out of battle immediately.  This can
   be used against normal enemies and bosses, and while exiting out
   (by pressing L1+R1+Select) doesn't get you any AP, EXP, or Gil, it's
   considered a win for all practical purposes as events will continue
   normally should you exit out of a boss battle, etc.

This code affects all your allies.  You need at least one of the
following in order to make use of this code:

 - One Magic Materia in order to cast spells.
 - One Summon Materia in order to call a summoned monster.
 - One Enemy Skill Materia in order to use Enemy Skills.
 - One Manipulate Materia in order to manipulate enemies.
 - At least one item that is usable in battles in order to change the
   effects of that item.
 - One character who has his Limit Break bar maxed out, at any level.
   (optional)

This chart below shows how the number you enter into the code affects
the resulting commands in battle:

Notes  __________________________________________________________________

USING ITEMS:
- After 046, all items will do zero damage when used.  The effect that
  goes with each item changes (Fire2, Vaccine, etc.)

USING SPELLS:
- 036 will instantly summon Death, who will kill one of your
  characters.
- Using 037 gives you a blank spell, which you can never have enough
  MP to cast.
- Using 038 - 047 casts a spell with the name of a Summoned Monster.
  All of these spells cause immense damage to the enemy, except
  Leviathan, which causes zero damage.
- Using 048 - (onwards) casts a spell with the name of a Enemy Skill.
  The effect upon a target is very strange (looks like an Elixir being
  used, sounds like Barrier, etc.) but the result really is that
  particular Enemy Skill.

USING SUMMONS:
- Using 10 - 21 results in a Summon with the name of the current spell,
  and the summoned monster is the base monster onwards.  The result is
  the corresponding base Enemy Skill (for example, 10 makes you cast
  MBarrier, which looks like Choco/Mog, and hits one enemy with the
  effects of Frong Song.  On the other hand, 12 makes you cast Wall,
  which looks like Ifrit, and hits one enemy with the effects of Magic
  Hammer).

USING ENEMY SKILLS:
- Using 17 or 18 doesn't summon anything, but the resulting damage and
  range are similar to the Fat-Chocobo and Gunge Lance summonings.
- Using 1A - 1E result in you casting Roulette.
- Using 1F makes you cast Matra Magic.
- Using 20 really does cause Death Joker (ouch)!

USING THE MANIPULATE MATERIA:
- Assuming you can manipulate an enemy, you need only change the number
  and try to use any of that enemy's powers to see what the result is.
  Note that if you go to far ahead (try to access a power that isn't
  there), you may crash the game or start up the 'error checker'.

USING LIMIT BREAKS:
- In most cases, using a Limit Break results in the 'error checker'
  starting up.  However, be careful, because you may end up crashing
  the game if the code gives your characters someone else's Limit
  Break (in one case, Red 13 tried to use Gigadunk and the game
  crashed.  Another time, he did Vincent's 'Satan Slam', and it
  worked!)

CAUTION:
- Using this code along with the 'Throw' command will hang the game as
  your character tries to throw repeatedly.
- This code may cause enemies or allies to move to different locations
  on the screen, and will interfere with the zoom/position of the
  battle camera.
- Some of the numbers will cause the game to hang.  Others cause the
  'error checker' to appear, so use them with caution.

Okay, as you can tell, this code still requires much more testing.  If
you come up with any interesting results, please let me know.  Right
now, I'm trying to discover an easier, surefire method of calling up
the 'error checker' using this code (as that would allow you to skip
any battle instantly!)


NO TIME LIMIT - ANY CHARACTER                             800E7A48 - 000x
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace x with:

               0 = Character in the 1st position
               1 = Character in the 2nd position
               2 = Character in the 3rd position

When using this code, the affected character(s) will be given their
chance to act during a battle immediately.  You can also give them new
commands while they are attacking, casting magic, etc (the only
exception is during a Summon or if they get past the initial frames of
a Limit Break).  Otherwise, the battle is played out normally.

This code can lead to some strange situations, like windows that don't
close, or you may have chosen to cast a spell eight times in a row only
to run out of MP after the third one (in which case, you simply waste
the next 5 turns while the message "You don't have enough MP!" appears
on the screen repeatedly.  In some cases, there's nothing you can do
about the windows, but if you try going into that particular window
(say, the Limit Break window), and then exiting out, it should close.


GAIN LOTS OF EXPERIENCE POINTS                            8009D7D8 - xxxx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace xxxx with any number; FFFF for the most EXP, 0000 for no EXP.

This code gives you hecka EXP when you win a battle, regardless of what
kind of enemy you fought.  That's all there is to it :)


BATTLE COMMAND SELECT - 1ST POSITION                      8009D8A4 - 02xx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code will make the third slot in your Battle Command window change
to what you specified using this code:

Replace xx with =

00 = Left            0F = 4x:
01 = Attack          10 = <blank>
02 = Magic           11 = Mug
03 = Summon          12 = Change
04 = Item            13 = Defend
05 = Steal           14 = Limit
06 = Sense           15 = W-Magic
07 = Coin            16 = W-Sum.
08 = Throw           17 = W-Item
09 = Morph           18 = Slash-All
0A = D.blow          19 = 2x-cut
0B = Manip.          1A = Flash
0C = Mime            1B = 4x-cut
0D = E.Skill         1C = <glitch>
0E = All:            1D = <glitch>

Normal abilities will work as they should, but some of them function a
little differently.  Note that none of the commands that make use of
the Summon screen actually reduce your character's MP, although you
must have enough MP to be able to select that summon spell.

Left    - When used, this brings up the Summon Screen (you must have at
          least one equipped Summon Materia for this to work).  Choosing
          a summon results in no effect for that character's turn.

Change  - When used, this brings up the Summon Screen (you must have at
          least one equipped Summon Materia for this to work).  Choosing
          a summon results in the character changing row position.

Defend  - When used, this brings up the Summon Screen (you must have at
          least one equipped Summon Materia for this to work).  Choosing
          a summon results in the character defending for that turn.

Limit   - When used, this brings up the Summon Screen (you must have one
          or more Summon Materia equipped for this to work).  Choosing
          a summon results in the character's respective Limit Break.

The 'Limit' ability is by far the best one, because you can use any
limit break providing you have seven Summon materia equipped (4 in the
case of Vincent, 2 for Cait Sith), without having to change break levels
or fill your Limit Bar.  Even better: if you try to use a Limit Break
you don't have (the 8th summon for most characters, the 2nd, 4th, 6th,
8th and so on for Vincent, or the 2nd, 4th, and so on for Cait Sith),
you get a _perfect_ 'error checker' allowing you to bypass _any_ battle,
boss or otherwise!

CHARACTER SELECT - SEE THEM DURING THE GAME               8009CBDC - xxyy
submitted by Igancio DeLucas  <delucas@hotmail.com>       8009CBDE - 00zz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace xx, yy, and zz with the number that represents your character.
This code allows you to choose three characters at one time:

xx, yy, zz = 00  -  Cloud Strife
             01  -  Barret Wallace
             02  -  Tifa Lockheart
             03  -  Aeris Gainsborough
             04  -  Red 13
             05  -  Yuffie Kisaragi
             06  -  Cait Sith         (sometimes, Young Cloud)
             07  -  Vincent Valentine (sometimes, Sephiroth)
             08  -  Cid Hiwind
             09  -  <Young Cloud>
             0A  -  <Sephiroth>
             0B  -  <Chocobo>
             0C  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)
             0D  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)

With this code, the character in the first position (use the 'Order'
command from the main menu) can be seen in the rendered areas (note that
it may be the second position, this seems to happen from time to time).
In the World Map, your character will be Cloud unless one of the
characters has been specified as Tifa or Cid, in which case, that
character will be the one shown regardless of order.  Note that only
Cloud can climb up ladders and do other acts other than walking or
running, and if you try to do such an activity with another character,
you will hear the sound of that character doing something, but they
won't actually do it, and if you try again, the game may glitch.  Also,
note that your character won't always appear in some areas, and that
they won't actually change until you exit an area.  An even stranger
glitch is that, if you start a game saved in the World Map, that you
are transported, usually out into the ocean at the far edges of the
map.  I haven't found a use for this yet, but it's interesting, to say
the least.

Otherwise, this code works like the CHARACTER SELECT - 3RD POSITION code
listed below, including glitches and game bugs (having a character die
in battle, the trouble with the Sephiroth, Now Printing character codes,
having the leader be invisible, activating the 'error checker', etc.)


USE ANY OPTION ANYWHERE                                   8009D2A4 - xxxx
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>        8009D2A6 - 0000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this code, all of the Main Menu options are available during any
point of the game, even if they are greyed out or not supposed to be
visible w/out the code.

Replace xxxx with 0000 for no options available (heh), but the one you'll
want to use is FFFF, which gives you all abilities.  Note that if you
have less than 3 characters (and no characters in the 'inactive' group),
and you enter the PHS menu, you can't exit out, as you have to make a
three-member party but won't have enough members.

Mr. DeLucas would like to stress that credit is also due to the original
creator of the 'Save Anywhere' code, whoever he/she is, because he used
that person's code as a basis for this one.


SET TELEVISION RATING IN JUNON TOWN PARADE                80075E40 - xxxx
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this code on, during the part in Junon Town (in Disc 1) where you
are supposed to march behind the soldiers, you can set the percentile
rating you recieve.  Replace xxxx with 0000 for the worst rating, or
5500 for the best rating.

Note that you should turn this code on _after_ the commander tells you to
get in line, or the game may glitch (as in, he'll never ask you to get
moving, so you'll stay marching).


SET DRILL EXCERISE SCORE IN JUNON TOWN SEND-OFF           80075E3A - xxxx
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this code activated, during the drill part of Rufus' send-off to
Costa Del Sol (the part where you must follow the soldier's lead and
turn, act, etc.), you can set the score Rufus gives you depending on his
attitude.  Replace xxxx with 0000 for the worst score, or 0014 for the
best score.


SET POINTS EARNED FROM PLAYING G-BIKE GAME                800BDFB4 - xxxx
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When turned on, this code can be used to determine the score you'll
receive from the G-Bike game at the Gold Saucer (not the actual G-bike
scenario when you escape from the Shinra Headquarters).  Replace xxxx
with 0000 for the worst score, or 2000 for the best score.


FIRST FIVE ENEMIES HAVE BEEN SCANNED, LIKE USING 'SENSE'  800F5CF0 - 4000
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>        800F5D34 - 4000
                                                          800F5D78 - 4000
                                                          800F5DBC - 4000
                                                          800F5E00 - 4000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you use the 'Sense' command on an enemy, it shows you it's vital
stats.  Afterward, pressing Select and highlighting a 'sensed' enemy
with the cursor (usually when choosing a target), will display that
enemy's amount of current/maximum HP.  With this code activated, you can
see the current/maximum HP of any enemy in the game, as if you had
scanned them.

Note that this code will work on _every_ enemy and boss, but that enemies
that aren't normally able to be 'scanned' may have misleading amounts of
HP, or they may cause this game to freeze, in which case, you'll have to
reset the game.


TURN ANY TAME CHOCOBO INTO A GOLD ONE                     800E5674 - 0004
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Yeah, I fixed the 3/E mistake.  Thank you everyone *sarcastic sigh*
for telling me about this, repeatedly.... ^_^;)

(Just to clear up any confusion, this is the same code as my Gold Chocobo
code for the Japanese version of FF7.  However, since Mr. DeLucas not
only tested my code for me but corrected it so that it'd work on the US
version, he gets credit for doing all the work :))

You must be riding a tame chocobo (any color) for this code to work (you
can get tame chocobos in Disc 2 or 3, see the 'breeding' guide for more
information).  When this code is activated, your chocobo will gain all
the abilties that a gold chocobo would have (it can go over rivers,
mountains, the sea, etc.)  Remember, though, you can't leave the World
Map while the code is on, so you'll have to turn off the code before
entering any area.  When you come back out, the chocobo will have
'reverted' to normal, so you'll have to get back on and flip the switch
up again to re-activate the code.  Also, the code sometime glitches if
you enter the desert around the Gold Saucer.


ALTER CLOUD'S ELEMENTS/STATUS AILMENTS EFFECTS               (see below)
submitted by Ignacio DeLucas <delucas@hotmail.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since all of these codes only apply to Cloud, and because they all work
in the same way, I'm listing these codes together:

Any Weapon attack strikes with all Elemental types:
8009D888 - FFFF

This code works just as it says.  However, if an enemy is immune to a
certain type of element, then they will be healed instead of harmed
regardless of the other active elements.

Take half damage from all Elements:
8009D88A - FFFF

Take No damage from all Elements:
8009D88C - FFFF

Absorb all Element damage as HP:
8009D88E - FFFF

(Remember that for these last three codes, you're also able to defend
against the unlisted 'non-element' damage type.)

Any Weapon attack strikes with all Status Ailments:
8009D890 - FFFF
8009D892 - FFFF

(With this code, the 'Petrified' status takes precedence over all other
status afflictions, so while you are attacking with every status effect,
the one that will override the others is 'Petrify'.  If you haven't
already realized this, using Slash All along with this code lets you
petrify all enemies with one attack, instantly making you win the
battle..... :))

Cloud is unaffected by all Status Ailments:
8009D894 - FFFF
8009D896 - FFFF

(Unfortunately, this code seems to affect beneficial status changes as
well, such as Haste.)


GAIN LOTS OF ABILITY POINTS                               8009D7DC - 8FFF
submitted by Jeff Wong <JeffWong@Pacbell.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you win a battle, you'll gain lots of AP.  Don't change the number
to a value higher than 8FFF or you won't actually earn the AP listed.


UNLIMITED GIL                                             8009D260 - FFFF
submitted by Jeff Wong <JeffWong@Pacbell.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code gives you a huge amount of gil, which you'll always have the
same amount of as long as the switch is up.  You can save your game in
order to retain all the extra money, too.


HAVE 9999 GOLD PIECES AT THE GOLD SAUCER                  8009D3D2 - 270F
submitted by Jeff Wong <JeffWong@Pacbell.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The title says it all.  You'll have 9999 GP, and if you save the game,
you'll retain all that GP, too.


HAVE 65000 BATTLE POINTS AT THE GOLD SAUCER               8009D3D8 - FDE8
submitted by Jeff Wong <JeffWong@Pacbell.net>
edited by Dave Upton   <azurite@baybytes.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This works much like the last two codes in that you'll have lots of BP,
and that number won't decrease as long as the switch is up.  However,
since BP are temporary, if you leave the Battle Square with the switch
off, all your BP are lost.


NO RANDOM BATTLES WHILE ON THE WORLD MAP                  8007173C - 0000
NO RANDOM BATTLES WHILE IN A RENDERED AREA                8011627C - 0000
submitted by Jeff Wong <JeffWong@Pacbell.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both of these codes are listed together because they function similarily,
and you'll want to use them both ^_^;  As long as the switch is up,
you'll never run into battles, however, you _will_ have to fight boss
battles and other unavoidable confrontations.


KEY ITEM SELECT                                           (see below)
submitted by Charles Mac Donald <cgfm2@hooked.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yup, someone finally came up with a Key Item Select code (I've been
trying to make one since the earliest versions of my Japanese FAQ way
back in March), and it's none other than Charles MacDonald!  I'll let
him explain how the code works from here:

8009 D2C8 FFFF - 1st  16 items
8009 D2CA FFFF - 2nd  16 items
8009 D2CC FFFF - 3rd  16 items
8009 D2CE 0007 - Last  3 items
             
For those interested, the item(s) you get correspond to the individual
bits enabled within the longword. In regard to the last set of items,
there are only three, so don't enable bits for the non-existant items.

Also, certain key items (Like PHS) you can't use immediately, even
though you have that item.  That's because the use of some items are
story-driven.  You just have to wait [until they become normally
usable].

(Okay, back to me!)

Obviously this code is cool because it lets you have all the items, but
as they are story-driven (like CGFM2 sez), you can't (for example),
have the Sector 5 Key in your inventory and return to Midgar City in
Disc One.  Still, though, this code is worth having (since it turns out
it's possible to make one after all).

  7.6  having fun

 A good deal of the chocobo racing and snowboarding information in this
 section comes from Martin Debes, David McGrath, and KFattyPro2, so give
 them a hand, please!

 THE BATTLE SQUARE  -----------------------------------------------------

 To play this game, go to the Battle Square and enter the main building.
 Talk to the lady by the righthand booth and she'll give you an option.
 Choose the top one to enter the Battle Arena, or the bottom one to
 decline.  It costs 10 GP to enter the Battle Arena each time.  Should
 you accept, you have to choose which character will fight by himself
 in the Arena.

 Once inside the Arena, you have to fight 8 consecutive battles against
 randomly-picked sets of monsters.  Fighting is done normally, and you
 can use anything you have equipped (weapons, spell materia, command
 materia, items, etc.) to attack your enemies with.  Each time you finish
 a battle, you get the message 'GREAT!' and you're then told how many BP
 (Battle Points) you've won in that particular battle (it's on the right
 side of the window).  You have two options; pick the left one to keep
 fighting or the right one to give up and leave the Arena.

 If you choose to keep fighting, a slot machine appears prior to your
 next bout and you have to press O to stop the wheel.  Whatever you land
 on will have a significant effect upon you as soon as the next battle
 starts.  However, most of these conditions can be remedied by using
 items, and some (such as Minimum) won't even affect you if you're
 wearing an accessory that protects you from that type of status ailment.
 Below is a list of many of the various results you may land on:

           Poison        -    'Poisoned' status.
           Frog          -    'Toad' status.

           Stopwatch     -    Time spent in the Battle Arena times
                              30 is given to you in damage.

           Cure          -    Gain back 9999 HP.

 The worse off your character is, the more Battle Points you earn.
 So if you have no life left, all your materia are sealed, and you're
 poisoned, you'll get more BP then having beaten all the matches with
 no serious injuries or handicaps.  Of course, it is possible to cheat.
 For example, if your Magic materia have been disabled but you just
 used Mimic after casting a magic spell, you can mimic yourself to
 still use that spell.  Or if you have Throw combined to a Counter
 Attack materia and youritems are disabled, you will still hurl one of
 your throwable items.

 Each time you choose to keep fighting, yet another bar appears on the
 slot machine.  And because the eight battles are continuous, you'll keep
 whatever ailment you landed on in the last battle (unless you cured it),
 and get another ailment as well, making the battles progressively harder
 as you suffer from more and more handicaps.

 You do not gain AP, EXP, or gil for fighting in the Battle Arena.  You
 can't learn enemy skills, either, even if you proceed to win all eight
 battles.  You can Steal or Morph enemies to get items, but that's it.
 Using Limit Breaks in the Arena won't deplete your Limit bar when the
 battles are over, though.  Your fighting spree ends if:

  - You win all 8 battles.
  - You choose to give up after completing a battle.
  - You cast Escape on yourself or use an item that has a similar effect.
  - You run away :)
  - You are killed during the course of the battles :(

 Unless you're killed or run away, you will keep all the Battle Points
 that you've earned from each fight.  What's more, you can continuously
 enter the Battle Arena (providing that you have enough GP) and fight
 over and over to pick up even more Battle Points.  However, you lose
 _all_ your BP if you leave the Battle Square, so you have to get the
 number of points you want in one trip.  You can trade in the Points
 you've earned for prizes by going to the machines on the left or right
 side of the entrance and examining them.  The following chart appears
 if you have enough BP to purchase something.  Note that it changes
 multiple times and so is listed for Disc 1, later in Disc 1, and then
 for Disc 2 and 3.

 OmniSlash              32000
 W-Summon               64000
 
 You can buy as many of each item as you like if you have enough BP.

 Note that the first time you win 8 battles in a row, you can get a
 free pair of Sprint Shoes from the person standing at the foot of
 the flight of stairs outside (the one that says that she doesn't like
 fighters who are 'all talk').
 

 THE SPEED SQUARE  ------------------------------------------------------

 In the Speed Square, you have to shoot down targets while riding in a
 roller coaster.  The main thing to remember is that firing with a full
 gauge is better than constantly firing a near-empty gauge.  There are
 some invisible targets and hidden targets--it's up to you to find them,
 but here's a few pointers for high scorers:  the red things coming out
 of the lava are worth 70 points, the riverboat will give you more
 points depending on how long you shoot it, and one of the lights near
 the end of the ride can be broken for another 200 points.

 Prizes from this square include:

  Over 3000 points - Masamune, Custom Sweeper, 1/35th soldier
  Over 5000 points - Umbrella (Disc 1), Flayer (Disc 2-3)

 You can earn multiple 1/35th soldiers here, too.


 THE WONDER SQUARE  -----------------------------------------------------

 There are a bunch of games in this Square that you can play to earn
 GP or other prizes.

 (SUBMARINE GAME)

 The first play nets you 20 GP.  The first time you win the following
 battles, you'll get an item.

   - Underwater Huge Materia Battle:  Ink
   - Level 1:                         T/S Bomb
   - Level 2:                         Dragon Fang
   - Level 3:                         Dragon Scales
   - Level 4:                         Cauldron

 (ARM-WRESTLING GAME)

 You can win 1 GP for 100 gil by fighting the Sumo wrestler, or 2 GP
 for 100 gil by fighting the 'normal' wrestler.

 (MOG HOUSE GAME)

 The first time you win at 'Mog House' the person standing behind you
 will give you 30 GP.

 (BASKETBALL GAME)

 The first 10 dunks in a row are worth 1 GP, the 11th will double that
 amount to 20 GP.  The next ten dunks are worth 1 GP, and the 22nd dunk
 doubles that to 60 GP.  This continues at every next dunk, presumably
 (33, 44, etc.)

 (BIKE-RACING GAME)

 You can earn 10 GP instead of 2 GP if you score over 10,000 points.  In
 addition, you'll get a Speed Plus materia the first time you do this.

 (WONDER CATCHER GAME)

 Possible prizes include:  Nothing (!), 1 GP, 3 GP, Potion, 80 GP.

 (3D BATTLER GAME)

 Being beaten by the first two opponents nets you nothing, the third
 gets you 2 GP, and the fourth lands you 20 GP.

 (SNOWBOARD RACING)

 If Tifa or Cid is in your party, they'll randomly ask if they can play
 in your place.  Check out Tifa on the snowboard!

 Blue and Green balloons are worth 3 and 5 points, respectively.  Blue
 are semi-hard, while Green take a bit of skill to collect.  Don't forget
 to edge (R1)! It'll help you take corners a lot easier.  If you're going
 fast enough when you reach the goal, jump right before you pass the
 sign.  You'll fly through, hit the retaining barrier at the end, and fly
 right back out again!)

 The ranks in the normal courses are BAD (0-49), AWFUL (50-69), and GOOD
 (70-100?)

 Course A  ______________________________________________________________

 Speed up before coming to the course, then jump at the first cliff so
 you can nab the Blue balloon.  If you miss it, press Start and choose
 RETRY -- it won't cost you any more Gil.  (With free continues, one
 wonders how Shinra makes any money on this game!)  Keep collecting
 balloons and avoiding obstacles until you see the Moogle holding the
 arrow.  Ether slow down or take the curve creatively; I recommend the
 former, since a Blue balloon is soon after, surrounded by snow chocobos.
 A while later is the downhill portion -- don't miss the Blue balloon on
 your way in -- and this is your place to gain some speed.  Just avoid
 the obstacles!  Near the end you'll have to swerve around some igloos;
 make sure you do it at a high enough speed to clear the arch up ahead
 so you can collect the Green balloon.  The first time you score at
 least 90 points, you'll get 20 GP and a Safety Bit.

 Course B  ______________________________________________________________

 Don't miss the Blue balloon, but try to miss the rock under it.  A
 couple of sharp turns soon after requires skillful turning.  Too little,
 and you'll hit the walls.  Too much, and you'll spin out.  After a few
 more curves, you'll come to a metal-lined area with a Blue balloon near
 the beginning.  Following that is a sharp curve, then a forest with
 another Blue balloon between two trees.  Right at the end is an arch,
 beyond which is a Green balloon over a snow chocobo.  Time the jump
 right to clear the chocobo.  Several sharp turns challenge you soon
 after -- be careful not to hit the warning signs! -- and then you're
 given a breather with a slow curve to the left.  There's one more short
 curve, then the goal.

 Course C  ______________________________________________________________

 Soon after you enter the course is a line of 8 red balloons followed
 by a cliff and a blue balloon.  Collect 'em (and RETRY if you don't.)
 Beware the unmarked sharp turns that follow, and watch out for the
 snowman -- that blue thing is his hat, not a balloon....  Next are the
 ice caves.  Dodge falling icicles, and don't go straight through in the
 cavern areas, as chunks of ice will fall from the ceiling.  Dodge around
 the chunks, and collect the balloons.  Soon after the second cavern area
 is the exit; be sure to collect the Blue balloon as you jump out.  The
 rocky area after the caves shouldn't present too much of a challenge,
 but the curves soon after may.  Near the bottom, you'll come across Blue
 and Green balloons, each well protected; don't hit the obstacles in
 front, or the balloons will fly away.  Two balloons after is the exit.

 Time Attack  ___________________________________________________________

 Score at least a Good -- 70 points -- on each of the three tracks, and
 a yellow balloon will appear at the beginning of the track.  Collect it
 and all the obstacles'll disappear from the courses.  The objective now
 is to race your way through the courses.  Your best race time since the
 PSX was turned on will be represented by a ghost moogle.  Press START
 during the game and you'll be able to select between a snowboarding or
 a sledding moogle.  (You'll also be able to change the ground texture
 from snow to checkered.) Stay ahead of the moogle, and you'll have
 beaten your old time.  (On the straightaway at the end of Course A,
 either make sure Cloud is centered, or that he has a good lawyer...)
 The ranks in Time Attack are Fail, Poor, and Average.  There are
 surely more.

 As far as snowboarding goes:

 W/ Ballons               get

 -Good (beginner)        30 GP + Safety Bit
 -Good (advanced)        nothing
 -Good (crazy)           nothing

 I finally broke sec. on the beginner course (53.824) which gave me a
 "super" (the best) which meant that I had achieved a super on every
 course.  Now there is a new "ghost" I can race against!!!  It is a
 little cactrot (cactus type enemy from FFIII) I forget what they are
 called on this game however, it races me down the hill running.

 If you get 97/100 on advanced course you will get 100 GP and "All"
 Materia (>95 ?? may work too)

 If you get 96/100 on the crazy course you will get 300GP and a Crystal
 Bangle (>90 ?? may work too)

 CHOCOBO RACING  --------------------------------------------------------

 Again, Tifa or Cid will randomly ask to take your place in the race if
 they're in your party.

 There are four ranks in the Chocobo Races.  In increasing order, they
 are: C, B, A, and S.  Placing first moves you up in rank.  Place first
 in S a few times, and you'll win a prize pack of sorts for being so
 good: Sprint Shoes, Precious Watch, Cat's Bell, Chocobracelet, and a
 "Counter Attack" Materia.  (This only happens once)  Beware that
 sometimes you'll race against Teioh, whose Chocobo's stats are always
 higher than your own (+15 km, +250 stamina).  You *can* beat him, but
 it gets progressively more difficult as you advance in rank.
 Incidentally, once you race a Chocobo to S rank, you can bet at that
 rank.

 To win the bonus in S-Class 10 races need to be won (by the same
 chocobo).  The win ratio is 7:5:3 i.e. for best prizes only have 3/15
 (1/5) chance.  Green, Black & Gold chocobos also have an advantage in
 the racing, as they are not slowed by Space (Short), or the Waterfall
 (Long Course).

 FORT CONDOR BATTLES  ---------------------------------------------------

 You can fight at the Fort Condor during any disc, although if you want
 the Huge Materia, you'll have to play and win at least once in Disc Two.
 What's written here are brief instructions and simple strategies to win.
 The object of the game is to prevent the enemy from taking your land
 (this is indicated by a pink bar to the left of the screen), and to wipe
 your foes out before they finish you off.  Your guys are blue; the
 enemy's force is red.

 In the beginning, you'll be in control of a cursor and there are no
 enemies on the screen.  You can use this time to place your allies
 before the battle begins (while you can place icons during the battle,
 it's easier to start off right now).  You can only set people as far
 as the red line; if you can't place a person, a red X appears over the
 hand cursor.  Placing icons costs money (gil).  Remember, you can't
 place bad guys!  The types and statistics of each icon (good and bad)
 are as follows:

 Note that not all of these will be available initially (like the Fire
 Catapult and Tristoner).

 STATS. OF THE GOOD GUYS  _______________________________________________

 Commander               250             ???

 *   These guys can fly over obstacles, giving them more range.

 The bad part about all this is that it cost real money (your money!) to
 play this game.  So it's best that you stock up on gil before playing.
 However, you'll be paid gil for every ally left standing when the battle
 ends.  If you have 12 1/35 soldiers, you won't need to pay for your
 army, though.  To buy an icon, use the controller to select them and
 press O.  Then choose where you want to place one and press O again.  If
 you're placing a (Fire) Catapult or (Tri)stoner, then you'll see a red
 circle or wedge-shape when you place them; this indicates their line of
 fire.  Use the Control Pad to choose how you want them to aim their
 attack.

 When you're ready, press X and choose the top option.  The battle
 begins!  Your controls work like this:

 O               Accept a command.  Place the cursor over a character
                 and place this button and you'll be given an option;
                 see the list of icons to see what options are available.
 X               Decline a command
 L1 / L2         Decrease the Speed Plus of the battle
 R1 / R2         Increase the Speed Plus of the battle
 Start           Pause/unpause the game
 Select          Show/hide instruction screen
 Pad             Moves cursor/put over ally or foe to see their
                 statistics and the direction they're heading in.
 
 Every time one of your icons finishes walking, enters battle, or is
 killed, you will be asked if you want to go to their location/give them
 a new command (if they died, it asks if you want to place a new one).
 Press O to accept, or X to decline.


 ICON OPTIONS  __________________________________________________________


 Stoner                  TOP OPTION - DIRECTION.  You can redirect
 TriStoner               either type of droppers' line of fire.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - REMOVE.  The dropper is
                         destroyed.
 
 Catapult                TOP OPTION - DIRECTION  You can redirect
 Fire Catapult           either type of catapult's line of fire.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - REMOVE. The catapult is
                         destroyed.
 
 Fighter                 OPTION - ACTION.  Pick where you want any of the
 Defender                three icons to move to and press O.  If they
 Shooter                 can't walk to a certain location, an X appears
                         over the cursor.
 
 Repairer                OPTION - ACTION.  Works just like the ACTION
                         command explained above.

                         If you make a Repairer walk near a damaged
                         Catapult, Fire Catapult, Boulder, or Triple
                         Boulder, he can repair them (give them back
                         HPs).  These guys can automatically fight, too.
 
 Worker                  TOP OPTION - ACTION.  Works just like the WALK
                         command explained above.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - BOMB.  Creates a bomb that
                         explodes when enemies approach.
 
 The 'Dismantle' command for the catapults and droppers may seem useless,
 but once an enemy force has passed beyond the range of one of these
 icons, they are useless.  To free up space for more icons, (you can only
 have 20 at a time, remember?) you'll want to use this ability.

 Basically, the battle is fairly automatic.  People attack when close,
 the catapults and droppers fire continuously.  All you have to do is
 move, replenish, and place new members.  The battle ends when the 'land
 taken' meter maxes out (i.e. they reach the little brown hut) or you
 win the battle by destroying all the enemies.  Including the boss who
 shows up when most of the enemy force is defeated, there are about 40
 enemies in total, who climb up the screen in a more or less steady,
 continuous wave.  If you've played FF3, this feels a little like those
 'mass-crazy-fight-till-you drop battles', but without the rush of
 adrenaline that usually accompanies such a fight.  (Note that you'll
 have to wait a while before another fight is
 available.  Also, as far as I can tell, there's no point in donating
 money since you'll have to spend Gil to hire troops, anyway.)  The
 prizes you win from each battle changes with each new battle.

 STRATEGY FOR THE HUGE MATERIA BATTLE

 Hope you have some money.  Start by placing Tristoner at the top of each
 path and angle their line of fire to follow the path (that's 4).  Then,
 buy another one and place it at the main junction and make it fire
 straight forward.  Now, purchase four Fire Catapults and place them at
 the bottom of the paths, as close to the red line as you can.  Angle
 their line of fire to hit where the Tristoners can't.  If you can spare
 the gil, place two more just a little ways south and to either side from
 the main Tristoners for added protection.  Still with me?  Place some
 Defenders and Attackers down at the bottom, then place a whole bunch of
 Fighters, Attackers, and Defenders at the top of the screen.  Last, add
 in some Shooters in hard-to-reach areas where they can pelt the enemy.
 As your installments are destroyed/killed, all you have to do is place
 new ones.

 EXPENSIVE STRATEGY

 If you have a _lot_ of cash, then just go crazy with the Tristoners and
 keep placing new ones (since they'll instantly fire).  If the enemy
 gains too much ground, start amassing forces of Defenders and Attackers
 to take your opponents out and defend your installations.  The boss is
 easy to kill since he's slow and shows up when there's not a lot of
 people left (leaving him all buy himself).  Just gang up on him with
 Defenders and Fighters, and if you've placed them earlier, try to steer
 him towards the Bombs that the Workers can lay.

  8.  ANSWERS TO THE MOST-ASKED QUESTIONS
=========================================================================

This section contains answers to the questions that people just can't
stop asking.  This is for those of you who refuse to read the rest of
the FAQ and want your answers _now_!  Questions are listed roughly in
the order that their answers come up during the game.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I learn Enemy Skills, and where are all the Skills at?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   To use an Enemy Skill, you need an Enemy Skill materia.  With one
   equipped, go into a battle.  If an enemy uses their Skill on you,
   you'll spin around and a message will appear stating that you've
   learned it.  You _have_ to then win the battle; if you run away, you
   will not have learned it.  Some enemies will not use their Skills
   normally.  In some cases, you can control them using the Manipulate
   materia and then make them use their skill.  You can't have a friend
   use a skill on you in order to learn it, but if you have more than
   one Enemy Skill materia equipped, you can learn the skill for all
   materia at the same time.  Here's a list of available skills:

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ANGEL WHISPER                                           COSTS 50 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - This skill brings the target back to life and cures any status
      ailments.  It _sets_ the targets HP to a random amount (usually
      in excess of 7000 points.  However, this can mean trouble for
      characters with high HP, as they will actually have their life
      lowered by this skill.  Note that the 'setting HP' aspect of
      this spell doesn't affect enemies.
    - Learn from the women in the yellow swimsuits (Polan Solita) you
      meet in the Northern Crater (Disc 3 only).
    - You can manipulate a Polan Solita.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   AQUALUNG                                                COSTS 34 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - All targets are hit for water damage.
    - Learn from Jenova*Birth in the Forgotten Capital (Disc 1), or
      from the chimera-like Harpy in the Corel Desert, or from the
      floating dragon-like monster (Serpent) in the sunken plane near
      the Gold Saucer (Disc 2 or later).
    - You can meet Harpies if you walk around the edge of the desert
      (even if you don't have the Buggy).  Then just manipulate one
      when you meet it.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   BAD BREATH                                              COSTS 58 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Inflicts multiple status ailments on all enemies, including:
      Confusion, Frog, Minimum (Shrink), Mute, Poison, and Sleepel.
    - Learn from the green creatures with big mouths (Mobors) on the
      outside ledges in Gaea's Cliff (Disc 2).  You can also meet
      them in the Northern Crater.
    - Be sure to have some protective accessories equipped (such as
      a Ribbon), or you may be too weakened to kill the Molbor after
      it attacks.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   BETA                                                    COSTS 35 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - All targets are hit for fire-based damage.
    - Learn from the shadow snake (Midgar Zolom) in the marsh near
      the Chocobo Farm.
    - Midgar Zolom won't use this skill until he's been severely
      weakened (he'll start waving back and forth).

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   BIG GUARD                                               COSTS 56 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - This skill has the same effect as casting Haste, Barrier, and
      MBarrier on all your allies.
    - You can learn it from the shelled cratures (Beach Blug) that
      live on the shore near Gongaga Town.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - One foe is hit for special damage.  This attack does 1 point of
      damage for each time that you've run away from a battle since
      starting the game.
    - To learn it, purchase some Mimett Greens, and make sure you know
      L4 Suicide.  Go fight some Chocobos outside of the Chocobo Farm,
      or fight Chocobos living near Mideel.  If the Chocobo you fight
      has a level that's a multiple of 4, use a Mimett Green on it,
      then cast L4 Suicide on it.  It should counterattack with the
      Chocobuckle Skill.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   DEATH FORCE                                              COSTS 3 MP

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   MAGIC HAMMER                                             COSTS 3 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - One enemy is bopped on the head.  They lose up to 100 MP, which
      will be given to you.  It's worth noting that most enemies who
      rely on magic attacks will be unable to do much of anything if
      their MP is drained to zero.  This includes quite a few of the
      bosses.
    - Learn from the plant-like begins (Razor Weed), found on the tip

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   PANDORA'S BOX                                          COSTS 110 MP

    - All enemies are hit for physical damage.
    - You can learn this from the Dragon Zombies in the Northern
      Crater.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ROULETTE                                                 COSTS 6 MP

    - Learn from the Ultimate Weapon (Disc 2 or 3), or from the
      Dragon Zombies in the Northern Crater.

      concentrate on killing it in order to learn it.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   TRINE                                                   COSTS 20 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - All targets are hit for lightning-based damage.
    - Learn from Godo on the top floor of the pagoda in Wutai, or
      from the red crab-like Stilves in Gaea's Cliff (Disc 2 only),
      or from the spider-like Materia Keeper boss in the mountains
      behind Nibelheim (Disc 1 only).

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHITE WIND                                              COSTS 34 MP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - All allies will regain back lost HP depending on the current HP
      of the caster.  Everyone will also have their status ailments
      cured.
    - Learn from the white and green monsters (Zemzelett) in the
      grassy area near Junon.  You can also learn it from the winged
      serpents (Wind Wing) if you're hit by a barrier in the Whirlwind
      Maze (Disc 2 only).
    - You can't learn this skill from a Zemzelett unless you manipulate

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ????                                                     COSTS 3 MP

      is equal to the amount of damage the caster has recieved in
      battle thus far.

      this skill unless you take damage from it.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I get Yuffie Kisaragi to join my party?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   She can join during any disc.  You can meet her on foot, or in the
   Buggy.  The two places that she appears most often are the forests
   beyond the Gold Saucer (in the Gongaga Ara), and most forests in the
   Junon Area.  After a few battles, you should run into a fight with
   Yuffie.  She's easy to defeat and shouldn't pose too much of a
   problem.  When the battle ends, you'll appear in a plain with Yuffie
   lying nearby.  To get her to join your party, talk to her and respond
   to her like this:

   Reply: Not interested
   (talk to her again)
   Reply: ......petrified
   Reply: Wait a second!
   Reply: ......That's right.
   Reply: ......Let's hurry on.

   If you try to use the Save Point nearby, or if you give a wrong
   answer, Yuffie will escape and steal some gil from you.  This means
   that you have to re-find and re-fight her, then go through the same
   conversation again, if you want her to join.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Who is this guy near the Gold Saucer who exchanges gil for GP?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Every time you arrive at the Gold Saucer, there is a 1-in-60 chance
   that a man will be standing near the back of the screen, past the
   Save Point.  If you go up and talk to him, he will sell you one GP
   for 100 gil.  You can exchange up to 100 GP from him.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I open the safe in Nibelheim?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Well, the hints are as follows, for those who want to try it for
   themselves:

    - When reading the paper, move the cursor down to the blank space
      and try and choose it.
    - Examine the area around the bed on the upper floor.  Then go out
      and look in the hallway nearby.
    - Search the opposite end of the broken piano.
    - Open the chest in the greenhouse, then examine the chest again
      for another clue.

   The real problem is that most people forget that the safe's lock is
   just like a real one, so you have to go in more than one direction
   when selecting the numbers and you can't go past the number you want.
   The actual lock code is:

        RIGHT TO 36, LEFT TO 10, RIGHT TO 59, RIGHT TO 97

   When you open the safe, you'll be attacked by a monster, Lost Number.

   _____________________________________________________________________
   BOSS TIPS: LOST NUMBER                      LV: 35  HP: 7000  MP: 300

   This boss can be taken out just by attacking and using Limit Breaks.
   Magic spells (Fire, Ice, Lighting) that are at level 2 are also okay
   to use.  Heal yourself and use Summon Materia (like Choco/Mog) and
   you'll win in no time.  Aside from physical attacks, all this guy can
   really do is use a Bolt 2 spell on you, but it only does 400-500
   points of damage to one character, so it's nothing to worry about.
   Rarely, he does a double-fisted hammer punch to one character that
   averages 2200 points of damage, though, so pack in some Phoenix Downs
   before trying to tackle him.  If you blow off his red half (the one
   that uses magic) his physical attacks become more aggressive, so keep
   your HP up.  Likewise, if his purple half is destroyed first, the
   Lost Number will use more mid-level spells, like Quake 2, against
   your party.  It is possible to kill this boss without either part of
   it dying (by stunning it using the 'Choco/Mog' spell).
   _____________________________________________________________________


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I get Vincent Valentine to join my party?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Vincent can also join your party during any disc.  Go to Nibelheim
   and enter the Shinra Mansion.  Go to the pink cavern beneath the
   hidden spiral stairway, and open the northern door (the portal just
   before the library).  To open the door, you'll need the gold key
   from the safe (see above).  Once inside, go to the purple coffin and
   press O.  To get him to join you, respond in the following manner:

   Reply: Talk about Sephiroth.
   (When the coffin closes, press O again.)
   Reply: Who are you?

   Then, try to leave the pink cavern and he'll join you.  Vincent
   cannot join you during Cloud's flashback, just so you know.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What am I supposed to do with the sleeping man near Midgar?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The sleeping man will give you something when you have won a certain
   number of battles.  You can find him in a cave a little ways south
   and east of Midgar.  You'll need the Buggy, the Airship, or the
   Green, Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo to get to him.  If you want to
   get to him using the Buggy, drive it _into_ Costa Del Sol and you
   will have the option of transporting it back to the continent where
   Midgar is.

   Inside the cave is the sleeping man, of course.  He'll usually tell
   you how many wins you've gotten so far.  

    - If your last two digits are odd, he'll give you Mythril.
    - If your last two digits are even, he'll give you an item
      (usually a Bolt Ring or Ice Ring).

   If you have a piece of Mythril, you can take it to the blacksmith
   who lives in the house on the penninsula near the Gold Saucer.
   He'll let you trade the Mythril for a Gold Armlet (in the long
   wooden chest), or the Great Gospel Manual (in the metal lid on
   the upper floor).  You can return to the sleeping man and get as
   many rings or pieces of Mythril as you like.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What's the point of playing Tifa's piano?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Go to Nibelheim during Disc 2 or 3, when Tifa is in your party.  Go
   into Tifa's house, and head upstairs to where her piano is.  Choose
   the botom option twice, then press:

                X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X*

   You should find 1 gil between the piano keys.  Play the piano again,
   and you'll find an Elemental materia.  On your third play, Tifa will
   find a letter from Zangan and her Limit Break manual.

   * You can also play this theme (the 'Highwind' theme), by pressing:

                D, L, U, L1+T, L1+S, D, L, U, L1+X, R, D, L, D

   Or by using a combination of buttons and directions.  But you don't
   usually find anything this way.  Getting items from the piano is
   a bit iffy at times, and don't expect it to work out exactly as I've
   listed here.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I get back into Midgar?  (Sector 5 Key)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   In Disc 2 or 3, talk to the man standing by the doors near Midgar.
   He won't appear until you've rescued Cloud from Mideel village.  Then
   go to Bone Village (where you dug up the Luna Harp), and dig near
   the tip of the destroyed plane atop the dinosaur's skull.  Stand
   under the nose of the plane, face upward, then dig to find the key.
   You can use the key to return to Midgar.  There's not much to do
   here, but you can get Tifa's Ultimate Weapon from the ITEM building
   in the Wall Market, and you can buy the Sneak Glove from the
   Machine & Gun shop (where you bought the Batteries), also in the
   Wall Market.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Where are all the Turtles' Paradise Flyers?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are six of these flyers scattered across the world.  You can
   take the flyers to Wutai and give them to the restaurant owner in
   return for one of every kind of Source item, and a Megalixir.  The
   location of the six flyers are at:

    - One's in Midgar City, in the second floor of the southeastern
      building north of Aeris' house (look at the papers taped to the
      wall near the stairwell).

    - Another is in the Shinra Building, on the first floor, check out
      the board with papers on it near the elevators.  You can only
      read this at the beginning of the game or when you raid Midgar
      in Disc 2.

    - The next one is in the Gold Saucer.  Go to the Ghost Square and
      enter the hotel.  Read the sign that says 'SHOP' next to the
      shop entrance.

    - Two of them are in Cosmo Canyon.  One is stapled to the lefthand
      wooden post on the Tigerlily Arms Shop.  The other is the gold
      paper by the door on the second floor of the inn (the entrance
      is behind some haning cloth near the bonfire).

    - The last one is in Wutai.  It's on the bottom floor of Yuffie's
      house--it looks like a wall scroll hanging to the right of the
      doorway.  You can't get to it unless you've done the Yuffie's
      quest, though.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I get all the Huge Materia, and what are they used for?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   You can get the Huge Materia from these locations during Disc 2:

    - You'll get one if you prevent the Shinra train from crashing into
      North Corel.
    - You'll get one if you win the battle at Fort Condor.
    - You'll get one if you destroy the red submarine after finding it
      in the Underwater Mako Reactor in Junon, then go and search the
      red submarine using your submarine afterwards.
    - You'll get one if you use the correct code to free the Materia
      warhead from Cid's Rocket when it's launched into space.

    Note that regardless of the color of the Huge Materia during the
    game, you _earn_ them in the _order_ they're stored in the game.
    So while the materia in Cid's Rocket is blue, you'll get the Red
    Huge Materia from it if you skipped/failed the submarine quest.

    You can take all your Huge Materia to Bugenhagen's observatory in
    Cosmo Canyon.  After leaving them there, you can do the following:

    - Get mastered versions of all spell materia and take them to the
      Huge Green Materia to get a Master Magic materia.

    - Get mastered versions of all summon materia and take them to the
      Huge Red Materia to get a Master Summon materia.

    - Get mastered versions of Deathblow, Throw, Manipulate, Morph,
      Mine, Sense, and Steal materias and take them to the Huge Yellow
      Materia to get the Master Command materia.

    - Take the Bahamut and Neo-Bahamut summon materias to the Huge
      Blue Materia to get the Bahamut Zero materia (you don't need
      to master Bahamut or Neo-Bahamut).


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Where are all the Ultimate Weapons?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 All Ultimate Weapons have zero materia growth, but they have eight
 connected holders.  Best of all, they can power-up and do more damage
 under certain conditions, and when using the Morph materia, the damage
 done only drops to 1/3rd instead of 1/8th.  The only exception to this
 is Aeris' Ultimate Weapon, which has seven holders and can gain AP.
 Here's where they are and how you can power them up:

 - Cloud's "Ultima Weapon" can be gotten from killing the Ultimate
   Weapon who flies around the World Map in Disc 2 or 3.  This weapon
   does damage based on the difference between Cloud's current and
   maximum HP scores.  So when you have full HP, you'll do more
   damage, whereas if Cloud's life was 32/4400, he'd do much less
   damage.

 - Barret's "Missing Score" can be found while climbing up the stairs
   to the Mako Cannon for the battle with Hojo during the end of Disc
   2.  The chest holding his Ultimate Weapon cannot be seen or opened
   unless he's in your party.  Barett's weapon does more damage if you
   equip a materia with lots of MP on it (such as a mastered materia).

 - Tifa's "Premium Heart" can be found in Midgar during Disc 2 or 3.
   Get the Sector 5 Key from Bone Village and go to Wall Market.  Go
   into the building labeled ITEM and examine the computer.  If Tifa
   attempts a Limit Break but gets a MISS for one of her slots, the
   power of this weapon will increase.

 - Aeris' "Princess Guard" can be found in the Temple of the Ancients
   during Disc 1.  Open the chest in one of the corridors connected to
   the clock puzzle in order to find it.  When Aeris'a allies are in
   critical condition or are killed, this weapon becomes stronger.

 - Red XIII's "Limited Moon" can be gotten at Cosmo Canyon prior to
   the raid on Midgar in Disc 2 (or at anytime in Disc 3).  Go to the
   observatory and meet with Bugenhagen with Red 13 in your party in
   order to get this item.  The Limited Moon does more damage
   depending on how much MP Red XIII currently has (it works just like
   Cloud's Ultimate Weapon, but uses MP instead of HP).

 - Cait's "HP Shout" can be found in the Shinra Building during the
   raid on Midgar in Disc 2.  Look in the back row of lockers on
   the 64th floor.  Just like the Ultima Weapon, the HP Shout does
   more damage depending on how close Cait's current HP is to his
   maximum HP score.

 - Cid's "Venus Gospel" can be gotten in Rocket Town.  After the
   Huge Materia Quest that resulted in the destruction of Cid's rocket,
   go back to Rocket Town.  Talk to the old man who gave Cloud the
   Yushiyoki several times and he'll give Cid the Venus Gospel.  This
   weapon will do more damage depending on Cid's MP amount, just like
   Red's Limited Moon.

 - Yuffie's "Conformer" can be found in one of the chests in the wrecked
   underwater plane called "Gelnika".  If Yuffie's opponents are of a
   higher level than Yuffie's, she'll do more damage with this weapon.

 - Vincent Valentine's "Death Penalty" can be gotten Disc 2 or 3.  Put
   him in your party and visit Lucresia in the Waterfall Cavern on
   the western continent (you need the submarine or a Green Chocobo).
   Then visit her later on in the same disc, or in the next disc, and
   you'll find the Death Penalty waiting for you, as well as Vincent's
   Limit Break Manual.  The Death Penalty's power raises in proportion
   to how many enemies Vincent has killed since joining your party.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I learn my character's Limit Breaks?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Every character has seven Limit Breaks, excluding Cait Sith, who has
  two of them, and Vincent, who has four breaks.  To earn your Limit
  Breaks:

  Level 1, first break:
   - You start with this one already.

  Level 1, second break
   - Use your first break of that level 8 times.

  Level 2, first break:
   - Kill 80 enemies.  Your character has to be the one to deliver
     the killing blow in order to have it count.  You can kill an
     enemy in any way (spell, Morph, use an item, etc.)  Vincent
     only has to kill 60 enemies in order to fulfill this requirement.

  Level 2, second break:
   - Use your first break of that level 6 times.

  Level 3, first break:
   - See 'Level 2, first break' notes.

  Level 3, second break:
   - You must use your first break of that level 4 times.

  Level 4, extreme limit break:
   - Learn all your character's other Limit Breaks (6 for everyone
     but Cait, 3 for Vincent).  Then use your character's Limit Break
     Manual on that person.

  I suggest giving your character the Slash All materia or some spell
  that injures all enemies when trying to learn your first break for
  each new level.  Try to find an area where you can fight many, easy
  to kill enemies at once (like near Mideel).

  As for second breaks, try using a Hyper on the character whose break
  you want to learn, then give them a Cover materia so they'll take
  more damage and consequently have their Limit Break bars fill faster.
  If you're really desperate, give them a weak bracelet and a weak
  weapon so that they'll take more damage and be able to use their
  break more times without killing their opponent per battle.

  If anyone has any corrections for the Limit Break learning process,
  let me know, but please keep in mind that there's a glitch that
  affects the learning process (it's explained in the next question).
  As for those Limit Break Manuals, you can find them listed here:

   CLOUD STRIFE
   You must earn a varying number of battle points at the Gold Saucer
   in _one visit_.  You can then trade them in for the manual.

   BARRET WALLACE
   Get it from a lady wearing a hat in one of the buildings in North
   Corel after the train ride in Disc 2.

   TIFA LOCKHEART
   Go to Nibelheim in Disc 2 and play the 'Highwind' theme on the
   piano with Tifa in your party.

   AERIS GAINSBOROUGH
   Get xx wins in battle (where xx are two odd digits, for example: 33,
   175 or 291).  Then go to the cave where the sleeping man is and
   he'll give you the Mythril.  Head to the blacksmith's house by the
   Gold Saucer, give him the Mythril, then climb up the stairs and
   examine the metal lid at the end of the walkway.  Once you get the
   Highwind, doing this is a snap.  But Aeris will have already left you
   by then.  So, to get her manual while she's still in your party in
   Disc 1, do the following:

   Hop on the Gold Saucer Buggy.  If you haven't gotten it yet, keep
   playing until you've finished the Gold Saucer area.  Then pilot the
   Buggy _into_ Costa Del Sol.  You'll enter the town as if you had
   walked into it.  Go to the harbor and talk to the sailor by the boat.
   Choose the top option to pay 100 gil and you can then walk along the
   dock and enter a ship, which will return to Junon Town.  Although
   there's not much new here, you will get a different reaction from
   most people because you're no longer dressed up as a guard.  Anyway,
   once you exit the city (the fastest way is to take the helicopter--
   refer to the end of section 4e for details), you'll find that you've
   brought the Buggy with you!  From here, it's a simple matter of
   heading towards the river, crossing it at the ford below the
   waterfall, then heading up to the cave where the sleeping man is.
   And after getting the Mythril, you have to go _all_ the way back to
   the Eastern Continent so you can reach the blacksmith's house.
   Well, don't say I didn't warn you!

   RED XIII
   Go to Nibelheim and unlock the safe in the right wing of Sephiroth's
   Mansion (use the code in section 8 if you don't know how).  You'll
   receive Red 13's manual from the boss when you defeat him.

   YUFFIE KISARAGI
   Return to Wutai after completing Yuffie's sub-quest.  Head to the
   pagoda and beat the five bosses within--she'll get her manual once
   Godo is defeated in battle.

   VINCENT VALENTINE
   Once you have the submarine or a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo, go to
   the waterfall in the middle of the Western Continent.  If you enter
   the waterfall from the left side with Vincent in your party, he'll
   meet a girl from his past (Rukuresshia).  You have to visit the falls
   twice, once during Disc 2 and again before raiding Midgar City; it's
   during your second visit that you'll get his manual.

   CID HIGHWIND
   After you get a submarine, go underwater and search for the wrecked
   plane near the southern part of the World Map, between the Western
   and Eastern continents.  His manual is in one of the treasure chests
   inside the plane.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 I should be able to use my Limit Break Manual, but I can't?  Why?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   It's a glitch found in every version of FF7 that I know of aside
   from the original Japanese version.  You may earn no Limit Breaks,
   or start with all of them, learn a lot of them or none of them in
   one go, or (as is most common), not be able to use your Limit Break
   Manual when you're ready to.  There's no way around this short of
   restarting and playing a new game (and hoping that it doesn't happen
   again).


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is the 'special battle' in the Gold Saucer's Battle Square?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   You can enter this in Disc 2 after you get Cloud back in your party.
   Go to the Battle Square and earn enough BP to get the W-Summon
   materia and Cloud's Limit Break Manual (use it so that you have all
   seven limit breaks).  Then go and kill the Ultima Weapon, get the
   Ultimate Weapon.  Now, return to the gold Saucer and Dio will sponsor
   a special battle for you.  You'll have to fight against many tough
   enemies (mostly bosses).  Win the battles and you'll get lots of rare
   items, including the Cat's Bell, the Gambler, and so on.  The easiest
   way to win the special battle is to Mime something powerful or useful
   like a healing spell or Knights of the Round, so that even if you
   lose use of your magic or summon materia, you'll still be in the
   clear.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I raise those damn Chocobos?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   You're going to need a lot of money, patience, and luck if you want
   to raise chocobos.  The payoff is that you can breed chocobos that
   can swim, climb over mountains and go to places normal vehicles can't
   reach.

   Here are some brief instructions.  Remember, there is a random
   element to Chocobo breeding, so it may take a couple of tries to get
   the kind of Chocobo you desire.  Also, be sure to save after
   correctly completing a step as you'll undoubtedly have to reset a
   couple of times during the breeding process.

   - After getting the Highwind in Disc 2, return to the Chocobo Farm.
     You can purchase stalls from Choco Bill for 10000 gil per stall,
     and you'll need at least four stalls (you can purchase six total).
     Remember, after you don't need chocobos any more, you should just
     kick them out to make room.

   - Before you can start breeding, though, you need to stock up on
     supplies.  Fly to either Bone Village or the Chocobo Sage's
     house.  If you run around on the grass, you'll eventually fight
     an enemy called Vlakoradus.  Fight that enemy three times,
     stealing a Carob Nut from it each time (you'll need the Steal
     materia first).  Then, go to the Goblin Island or Round Island
     and steal a Zeio Nut from the Goblins that live there.  Finally,
     go to the Chocobo Sage's house and purchase 40 Sylkis greens
     from him.

   - Equip a Chocobo Lure materia.  Fly to the chocobo tracks near
     the Gold Saucer (by the shore), and capture a chocobo.  Press
     X to dismount from the chocobo, and choose the option to return
     it to the Chocobo Farm.  You need to capture 2 chocobos from
     here, although you can get the other chocobo later or not get it
     at all, if you wish.

   - Now, fly to the chocobo tracks near Mideel.  Capture a chocobo
     here, and send it back to the Chocobo Farm.

   IMPORTANT NOTE:  The gender of a Chocobo is not determined until you
   return to the Chocobo Farm and name them.  Therefore, it is advised
   that you save your game before naming them.  That way, if you don't
   get the kinds you want (see below), then you can reset and try naming
   them again and seeing if their gender changed.

   - Return to the Chocobo Farm and talk to Choco Billy.  Name your
     Chocobos (this will put them in the stalls).  Now, go up to
     your chocobos and examine them by pressing O.  You'll want to
     make sure that you have one male and one female (or two males
     and one of any gender, if you caught three chocobos).
     Furthermore, one of them should be the running kind (usually
     you'll want the females), and the other should be the walking kind
     (usually, this should be the males).  Your third chocobo needs to
     be a 'runner' type.

   - So, you have at least one male and female, and one is a walker
     and the other is a runner, right?  If not, you'll have to
     release the chocobos that aren't the ones you want and go and
     capture more (or reset, if you heeded the important note).

   - Choose to mate the chocobos, and tell Choco Billy that you
     want to feed them a Carob Nut as well.  Hopefully, you'll
     get a colored chocobo the next day!  It should be green or
     blue.  If not, you'll have to reset and give it another go.
     Keep note of your baby chocobo's gender--it's very crucial
     later on.

   IMPORTANT NOTE 2:  Later on in this process, you can race chocobos at
   the Gold Saucer (see below).  However, if you have trouble getting
   the correct type of chocobo during these few steps, you can
   optionally choose to race them.  The better your chocobo's race class
   is, the higher chance you have of getting the needed color type of
   chocobo.  Remember that you don't _have_ to race your chocobos, but
   the chance of getting a new type of chocobo is very low otherwise.
   If you want to have better chances at winning the races, feed your
   Chocobos various types of Greens until you get the message 'no
   improvement....' to make sure that you've maxed out that trait of
   your bird.

   - At this point, waste some time, then mate your unused 'runner'
     chocobo with the green chocobo.  You can repeat the last few steps
     (get a chocobo from the Gold Saucer, get a chocobo from Mideel,
     make sure they're both the correct types, and breed them using a
     Carob Nut).  Or, if you got two other chocobos the first time
     around, you can then breed them together.  Your third choice
     is to use the same pair of chocobos that you just breeded.  In
     that case, you'll have to waste some game time, as chocobos that
     have just mated can't do it immediately again.

   - In any case, you'll want to breed your chocobos together and get
     a blue chocobo, using the steps outlined above.  Your blue chocobo
     MUST be the opposite gender of your green chocobo, or you can't
     mate them.  Feed the blue chick and the green chick 10 Sylkis
     Greens each.

   (these next 2 steps are optional)

   - Get in the Highwind and go to the Gold Saucer via North Corel's
     ropeway.  Go to the Chocobo Square and talk to Ester.  Tell her
     that you want to race using either your green or blue chocobo.
     The goal here is to keep racing until your chocobo's race level
     reaches A.  To do this, win the races consistently; it will take
     a couple of tries.  To ensure winning, just use Automatic Mode
     for most of the race and hold R1 + R2 to recover lost Stamina
     while racing, or all four shoulder buttons to run faster.  After
     one chocobo has hit rank A, do the whole racing process again with
     the other one.

   - Once your green and blue chocobos are both rank A, return to the
     Chocobo Farm.  Breed the two chocobos together, using your last
     Carob Nut (refer to the above steps for help).  If everything
     worked out, you'll have a black chocobo.

   - Fly to the Northern Continent (the snowy one), and look for
     Chocobo tracks on the western edge of the continent.  Land and
     then capture a chocobo at the tracks.  Return to the Chocobo
     Barn and name it (it should be the opposite gender of your
     black chocobo, and should be the 'dashing' kind--it runs very
     fast with it's head down).

   (this step is optional, but you still have to feed them a Zeio Nut)

   - Now for the fun part.  Feed 10 Sylkis Greens to the black chocobo
     and the dashing yellow chocobo.  Then, go _back_ to the Gold
     Saucer and race both Chocobos up to race class A again!  When
     they're both at rank A, go back to the Chocobo Farm and tell
     Choco Billy that you want to mate them, using the Zeio Nut this
     time around.  With a little luck, you'll get the Gold Chocobo!

   Unlike wild chocobos that you can catch, the ones that you've named
   are tamer, and if you get off them, they will stay where you left
   them until you get back on.  You can also ride a tame chocobo into
   the Highwind and transport them around with you on the airship.

   YELLOW CHOCOBOS can go anywhere you can normally get to on foot.  The
   sole advantage is that a chocobo is a lot quicker than walking.

   BLUE CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers, but they can't go past
   waterfalls.  They can also walk in shallow water, just like Cid's
   airplane could.

   GREEN CHOCOBOS can run over mountains, even the pointed mountains by
   Nivelheim.  They can also dash over _most_ cliffs and drops.

   BLACK CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers and move around in shallow
   water.  They can also run over mountains and cliffs.  Unlike the blue
   or green chocobos, the black variety can go over any cliff or drop:
   even walk up or down waterfalls, enter the canyon surrounding the
   Ancient City, or walk _over_ the ice forest that you have to traverse
   in Disc 2 after the snowboard scene!

   GOLD CHOCOBOS can do everything a black chocobo can--they can also
   walk in the ocean, allowing you to go anywhere you want, even into
   the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer (just like the Saucer
   vehicle).  Truly the ultimate in transportation!

   In case you didn't know about it, you can rotate the chocobo you're
   viewing when using the various options in the Chocobo Farm by holding
   the R1 or L1 buttons :)


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How do I kill the Ruby Weapon?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Ruby Weapon appears in the Corel Desert near the Gold Saucer
   after you the Diamond Weapon is destroyed in Disc 2.  I suggest
   that you use the characters with triple AP growth weapons (Cloud,
   Cid, Red 13, Yuffie, etc.), so that you can take advantage of all
   the AP you'll earn.  Equip your characters with Mystiles, or
   if you don't want to, Rune Armlet or Platinum Bangles.  If your
   HP is low, you may also consider wearing fire-protective equipment
   (or use the Elemental Materia + Fire / Phoenix when equipped to
   your weapon).  As for accessories, give everyone Ribbons.

   Concerning materia, you'll need three Master Commands, or one or
   two Mimic materia.  You'll also need one Master Summon, Hades,
   or Knights of the Round materia.  Finally, you need one W-Summon
   materia, one HP Absorb materia, and then three Revive materia for
   each of you and as many HP Plus materia as you need.  If your
   magic powers are low, I suggest a Magic Plus materia as well.
   Bring along plenty of Elixirs, Megalixirs, X-Potions, and Turbo
   Ethers.

   You can be any level to beat the Ruby Weapon, although you need
   enough MP to cast Knights of the Round.  Kill off your two allies
   before the round begins, or just after the round begins.  This
   way, you have a much lower chance of it using 'Whirlsand' once
   you revive your allies.  Once the Ruby Weapon sticks it's arms
   into the ground, revive your friends.  One character should have
   these materia:  Master Summon attached to HP Absorb, and W-Summon.
   Or, Knights of the Round + HP Absorb, Hades, and W-Summon.  All
   characters should have a Master Command or Mimic materia.  All you
   need to do is have one character W-Summon Knights of the Round and
   Hades, then have all three characters mimic that until the Ruby
   Weapon dies.  It's that easy!

   This is because Hades keeps the Ruby Weapon 'stopped', so you
   can attack it without fear.  If your characters die, revive them
   and restart the process of mimicking one character's W-Summon.
   However, this isn't likely to happen, as the HP Absorb materia
   will give back thousands of HP to each character when they mimic
   the W-Summon casting.  Alternately, you can W-Summon Knights of
   the Round twice.  This will allow you to win much faster, but is
   also more risky.

                         3500+ damage)
            Ruby Ray     (causes around 3000 damage to one ally, plus
                          Confusion)
            Ruby Fire    (causes Fire-based damage to one ally)
            Ultima       (used as a counterattack, as per the spell)
            Shadow Flare (Enemy Skill)

            Ruby's attacks can also cause 'Toad' and 'Slow Petrify'.
  
   *  Can't be used when the 'Ruby's Tentacles' are present.

   Notes:   - Can dig it's hand into the ground, turning them into
              additions called 'Ruby's Tentacles'.
            - The Ruby Weapon cannot be 'sensed'.
  
   Attack:  The Ruby Weapon has a host of deadly attacks when it's
            tentacles aren't around, so it's in your best interest
            to get it to stick it's hands into the ground so as to
            reduce it's arsenal.  It will use the Ruby Ray and Ruby
            Fire often, sometimes twice in a row.
  
            It also casts the Ultima spell as a _counterattack_.  This
            means that if you W-Summon Hades and KoR, and it isn't
            currently paralyzed, it may use Ultima _between_ the first
            a second spell cast.  There's no real way to defend against
            this aside from having high life, although the Mystile
            bracelet has such a high magic evade rate that you can
            dodge Ultima about 70% of the time.

   Attack:  Generally, you don't have to worry about these two
            parts of the Ruby Weapon.  The damage they inflict
            varies (less damage as your life gets lower, sort of
            like the Demi spells), but their ability to sap MP
            can be a problem if you're forced to stop miming
            KoR + Hades and revive a character.  For that reason,
            keep plenty of MP-restoring items on hand.

 How do I kill the Emerald Weapon?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Emerald weapon will appear on the ocean flor once you've gotten
   a gray or red Shinra submarine in Disc 2.  I suggest using Cloud,
   Barret, and Yuffie.  Give Cloud the Ragnarok, and Barret and Yuffie
   should use the Missing Score and Conformer.  Give your characters
   all Wizard Braces, but one person should be wearing a Ziedrich or
   Escort Guard.  Each person should also be carrying a Revive or
   Phoenix materia, and one person should have an Underwater materia.
   Give as many Counter Attack and HP Plus materia as you can manage to
   each person as well.  It's important that one person is wearing less
   materia than the rest so that they will survive the Aire Tam Storm
   attack (see below).  The easiest way to get lots of Counter Attack
   materia is to replace Barett with Cid, then give each character their
   triple AP growth weapon.  Go to the Northern Crater (you must be in
   Disc 3), and fight the Magic Pots and Movers.  Or, beat the Ruby
   Weapon first and have a couple of Counter Attack materia equipped
   in order to get them maxed out quickly.

   You should also have plenty of Megalixirs, Elixirs, X-Potions, and
   Turbo Ethers on you.  Your level should be pretty high, but I was
   able to beat the Emerald Weapon at Level 30 due to lots of HP Plus
   materia being equipped.  The only real problem is keeping your HP
   high as possible, which is easier at a higher level.

   The trick to beating the Emerald Weapon is that when it attacks you,
   you'll counterattack with all the Counter Attack materia you're
   wearing.  This means that you could technically earn up to 48 attacks
   inflicting 9999 damage per round, although more realistically, you
   should have about 8 Counter Attack materia per person.  All you
   really have to do is concentrate on staying alive.  You may want to
   use Final Attack + Revive, but it doesn't always work.  Just keep
   everyone's life above 8800 and you'll be okay.  Your main concern is
   the Aire Tam Storm, which causes damage equal to the number of
   materia someone is wearing.  If one person has less materia equipped
   than the others, he can survive the attack and then resurrect the
   others.  Alternately, you can use the 'W-Summon Knights of the Round
   twice' strategy listed for the Ruby Weapon.

   STATISTICS OF EMERALD WEAPON:

   LV: ??          EXP: 50000       Steal: n/a
   HP: 1000000     AP:  50000       Win:   Earth Harp
   MP: 100         Gil: 50000       Morph: n/a
   Control: n/a
   Attacks: Emerald Shoot  (around 8000 damage to one target)
            Emerald Beam   (around 6000 damage to all targets + DeSpell)
            Revenge Stamp  (around 3000 damage to all targets)
            Aire Tam Storm (inflicts varying damage to all targets)

   Notes:   - Has four body parts, called 'Eyes'.  It can rejuvanate
              them once they are all destroyed, but it takes a few
              rounds.
            - The Emerald Weapon cannot be 'sensed'.

   Attack:  The Emerald Weapon will use the Emerald Shoot repeatedly.
            After a while, it will use the Emerald Beam, then expose the
            four Eyes.  It will continue to use Emerald Shoot, and will
            counterattack with the Revenge Stamp every time an Eye is
            killed.  When all four Eyes are killed, it will go back to
            relying solely on the Emerald Shoot, but in a few rounds it
            will use Emerald Beam again, and then rejuvanate and re-
            expose all four Eyes.  The Aire Tam Storm inflicts more
            damage to a character if they're wearing more materia.

   STATISTICS OF EYE:

   LV: ??          EXP: (shared)    Steal: n/a
   HP: ~25000      AP:  (shared)    Win:   (shared)
   MP: 0           Gil: (shared)    Morph: n/a
   Control: n/a
   Attacks: <no name A>  (causes 5000+ damage to one opponent)
            <no name B>  (drains 550+ MP from one opponent)
   
   Notes:   - There are four of these.  They fight independently of the
              Emerald Weapon.
            - None of them can be 'sensed'.
   
   Attack:  Once the Emerald Weapon exposes these, they will continually
            fire beams at your party.  It's a good idea to kill them all
            as soon as possible, but watch out for the Weapon's 'Aire
            Tam Storm' attack after destroying the last Eye.

 Where is the Guide Book, and what can I do with it?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   To get it, go to Junon and head towards the Underwater Mako Reactor
   (take the elevator at the end of the long gray hall that divides
   Junon into two halves).  There is an area two screens long that
   consists of a large glass ceiling allowing you to see the sea around
   you.  Go to the second screen (where the entrance to the reactor is),
   and keep fighting battles until you encounter a Ghost Ship.  Morph
   it, and it will become a Guide Book.

   If you return to Kalm after the Diamond Weapon is defeated, a man
   there will be asking for the Guide Book.  Give it to him, and he'll
   give you the Underwater Materia, which you can use to negate the
   time limit during your battle with the Emerald Weapon.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What else can I get from this guy in Kalm?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Kill the Ruby Weapon and you'll get the Desert Rose, which you can
   trade for a Gold Chocobo.  Kill the Emerald Weapon and you'll get the
   Earth Harp, which you can trade for a set of Master Magic, Command,
   and Summon materia.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What's this item duplication trick I hear about?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  All you need to do is get the W-Item materia from the tunnels beneath
  Midgar at the end of Disc 2.  The only requirement to the trick is
  that the item you want to duplicate must be usable in battle.  To
  duplicate an item, select the one you want a copy of, then select any
  other item.  Cancel that item, then choose another item, then cancel
  it, too.  Every time you cancel the second item, the one you chose
  initially increases by one!  This trick can be used to get a lot of
  Gil by purchasing a Sylkis Greens, duplicating it, then selling it,
  since it has the highest resale value of any item in the game.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Speaking of items, tell me what the 1/35 Soldiers do, and what the
 (no purpose) items are used for!
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you get all 12 of the 1/35 soldier items, you won't have to pay
   any money in the Fort Condor battles (I haven't tested this myself).
   You can get a couple of them in Junon, and win the rest in the
   Gold Saucer, at the Speed Square.

   As for the (no purpose) items, they aren't used for anything!  That's
   why I wrote that they had no purpose!  The Diary, Tissue, Gambler,
   Masamune Blade, Sweeper, and the rest of them have _no use
   whatsoever_.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What's the Lucky Sevens condition I get in battle sometimes?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   This condition occurs when one of your characters has a current HP
   amount of 7777.  This can be done via getting injured, equipping
   materia, or raising levels.

   The person affected by Lucky Sevens will make one _normal_ attack
   against each enemy when their Time Bar is filled, even if you have
   materia like Slash-All equipped.  Assuming that person doesn't
   miss, they'll always strike for 7777 damage, even if an enemy has
   special defenses.  The person with Lucky Sevens will automatically
   attack and cannot be made to perform any other action (even if
   you're wearing a Counter materia).  The drawback to this condition
   is that your HP drops to 1 point after the battle ends.

   Charles Lee has sent me various methods on getting this all the time:

   4 Examples (please read them all):

   1. Cloud's HP status at the Status Window, let's say, is: 7177/9038
      How do you get 7777 current HP points?
      That is, how to get 7777/9038?

   Ans: Use one Potion (HP +100) and one Hi-Potion (HP +500) on Cloud.
      7177+100+500=7777
      Now if you go into a battle, Cloud will be in "Lucky Sevens".

   2. Cloud's HP status is: 3577/7397
      (Note that the MAXIMUM HP POINTS is now less than 7777.)
      How can you get the "Lucky Sevens" in this example?

   Ans: Raise your maximum HP by equipping HP Plus materia(s).
      Suppose after equipping one HP Plus materia, Cloud's HP status
      becomes: 3577/9038
      To get 7777/9038, you can now use 2 Potions (2*100) and 8
      Hi-Potions (8*500): 3577+(2*100)+(8*500)=7777

   3. HP status is: 7781/9999
      How to get HP to be 7777/9999 for YOUR NEXT BATTLE?

      Let your enemy hit you for a few times.  When your current HP is
      close to and above 6777 (or 5777, 4777, 3777, 2777, 1777, 777,
      BUT NOT 7777 since you automatically go into "Lucky Sevens" mode
      but you actually WANT TO SAVE IT FOR THE NEXT BATTLE!), cast
      "Toad" on him so that he will hit you for 1 point damage only.
      When your current HP reaches 6777 (or 5777, 4777, 3777, 2777,
      1777, or 777), kill the enemy immediately.  As soon as the battle
      is over, go to the Status Window and use (Hi-)Potions to add your
      current HP to 7777.  Now when you enter your next battle, you
      should be able to sneak attack 62 times (which is what the Lucky
      Sevens does) with each of your attack doing 7777 pts of damage.

   4. HP status is: 7775/9999
      How do you get 7777/9999?

   Ans: Let your enemies (or allies) hit you until your current HP is
      close to but above xx77.  Suppose after taking some damage, your
      current HP is now 6285 (close to and above 6277).  Quickly cast
      "Toad" on your enemy transforming him into a frog and let him hit
      you until your current HP is 6277.  Immediately kill him and use
      3 Hi-Potions to add your HP to 7777.

   Note that when a character is in the Lucky Sevens condition, he or
   she will continuously attack 62 times.  When two characters have
   Lucky Sevens, they will attack 63 times _total_.  So if you have
   more characters in this condition, you'll do less damage overall.

 Is there really a way to view FMV scenes in my PlayStation?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Yes, but it's a bit random.  Before any FMV sequence begins, take
   out the disc you're using and quickly put in another disc.  If you're
   lucky, another FMV scene will be loaded.  That's it!

   This trick only works if you have a Yaroze, a modified PlayStation,
   or if the model number is SCPH-1000.  Thanks goes to EBWells for
   correcting me on this.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Are there other endings to this game?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   No!  There really and truly are no other endings aside from the one
   you see.  And while I'm on the subject of rumors, Aeris cannot be
   revived after Disc 1, you can't play with Sephiroth or Young Cloud
   without a Game Shark code (see above), and the last boss if always
   Sephiroth.  _Any_ rumor that you hear that is not mentioned in this
   FAQ is false, please believe me.
