 1.  FAQ INTRODUCTION
 ========================================================================

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  (Quick note from the author)
 
  I just went to GameFAQs and discovered that someone else has written a
  FAQ for this trick, and it's way more complete, too.  So aside from
  info. on the Japanese version of the game, my FAQ doesn't offer as
  much to the readers as his guide does.  That being said, I recommend
  you check out his (Andrew Dean's) guide at www.gamefaqs.com, it's very
  well written.  Of course, I'll still be working on my FAQ, but it's
  not gonna be complete for a long while.       -km

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 This FAQ is basically a quick guide explaining how the debug rooms work.
 Right now, the available options are mapped out, but only some of them
 are explained.  In future revisions, I'll include what each option
 does.  While I've done a little exploring in the Japanese debug room as
 well, I probably won't tackle that until I've finished figuring out all
 the options in the US debug room.  Btw, when I'm referring to the US
 version, it's the version released for the PlayStation in America, not
 the PSX European release or the PC release (because there are
 differences between them all, apparently).  And the Japanese version
 that I'm using is the original release of FF7 in Japan, not the
 "International" Japanese re-release.

 FAQ Notation

 (by name)       - the character is called by whatever name you gave
                   them.
 "square button" - the little Square button icon is shown.


 ========================================================================
 2.  GAMESHARK CODES
 ========================================================================

 All codes were tested on a Pro Action Replay v1.99.  They will also
 work with a GameShark, but I don't know if they'll work if you have
 a higher or lower revision number.
                                   
 Obviously, none of this would be possible without the GameShark code
 that lets you enter the Debug Room (in the US version), which was
 written by CzarDragon and RPGod.  The code is:

 English ver. Debug Room - 8009A05C 0041

 That code was modified by Charles MacDonald to make it work for the
 Japanese version as well:

 Japanese ver. Debug Room - 800987F4 0041

 Using either code is quite simple.  Simply start your game, turn the
 code on, and enter a new location (so that the PSX has to load it up
 off the disc).  You'll find yourself in the Debug Room.  Turn off the
 GameShark and explore to your heart's content.  I suggest walking
 into a new location (like a town) and not leaving from a location to
 the world map (such as exiting an area or town) as this tends to glitch
 the game or send you to the snowfield area.

 One problem with exploring the Debug Room is that you cannot return
 to the main room easily, and the game may glitch.  One way to return
 to the main room is to turn the GameShark back on and enter a new
 area (or be warped there).  The main room will look glitchy, but if
 you turn off the code and walk in the desired direction, you'll still
 end up in a new Debug Room location.

 Alternatively, to make exploring the Debug Room a little easier, I
 suggest using Ignacio de Lucas' "Use Any Option Anywhere" code, which
 you can use to save your game in the main room.  If you want to return
 to the main room at any time, you can just restart your game and load
 up your saved file.  That code is:

 English ver. Use Any Option Anywhere - 8009D2A4 FFFF
                                        8009D2A6 0000

 The Japanese version of this code (again, modified from the original
 by Charles MacDonald) is:

 Japanese ver. Use Any Option Anywhere - 8009BA3C FFFF
                                         8009BA3E 0000

 Now that you have the proper codes, you're ready to rock!


 ========================================================================
 3.  THE DEBUG ROOM
 ========================================================================

 In the US version, the Debug Room is a black background with the
 Japanese title for FF7 in the center (blue with "Final Fantasy VII"
 spelled using kana on the bottom).  There are 8 blue circles laid out
 in a circular pattern in the room, and sitting near one of the circles
 is a man.  North of the circles is a white bar with the name "Takashi
 Tokita" written in the right-hand corner.  Beneath the circles is a
 white bar with the name "Masato Koto" in the left-hand corner.

 In the main room, you can talk to the man, exit the main room by
 stepping on any of the eight blue circles, or by walking into the
 northern white line or the southern white line.  You can also exit
 the Debug Room by walking off-screen to the west.  There is nothing
 on the east side of the screen (just an invisible wall).

 Since navigating through the various rooms requires you to step on
 the blue circles, shown below is a map of the room.  The names are
 taken from the kanji found in each circle:

                                                          Takashi Tokita
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Kita (north)


                Kyou (capital)          No (field)


        Ko (old)         FINAL FANTASY VII       Tori (bird)
                               
                   [location of man]
                Toki (autumn)           Matsu (pine tree)


                            Sen (thousand)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Masato Koto

 The man is found sitting by the Toki circle.  For ease of use, I will
 simply refer to these circles as compass points ('Sen' is south, 'Tori'
 is east, 'Kyou' is north-west, etc.)

 If you can view Japanese (you can view this SHIFT-JIS text file in
 Japanese by using NJWIN or NJSTAR, available from www.njstar.com), you
 might prefer this map:

                                ñk

                        ãû              ñÏ

                å√                              íπ

                        èH              èº

                                êÁ

 The rest of the sections in this part of the FAQ will explain what can
 be found in each room, and what options are available in each room.
 Note that if you press Select, you'll bring up all the exit points for
 this room, most of which are misaligned or misleading.  The only exit
 points I've found are found by stepping directly onto a circle or
 stepping beyond the white line boundaries (or walking all the way to
 the west).                                      

 Most of the options people give you in the rooms either have to do with
 transporting you to various locations / events, or they will allow you
 to rearrange your party members.  Some options also deal with battles
 and fighting monsters.  A lot of the options, when used, do nothing.

 In most cases, the bottom option in each menu will exit you out of that
 menu (or if an option reads "cancel", "quit", or some variation of
 "yame").  However, not all menus can be exited from.  In some cases
 there are selectable options that appear blank, while other times you
 can actually selection an option outside of the box (by pressing up or
 down at the top or bottom of the screen).

 Keep in mind that the Debug Room is a very glitchy place.  Don't be
 surprised if your game hangs.  The same thing applies to CG movies,
 sometimes you're asked to put in the proper disc, but in other cases,
 the game will try to load a CG track (say, the fight against the
 Weapon), even if that's not on the disc you're playing with (i.e,
 Disc 1).  This may hang the game, or result in snippets of another
 CG sequence being shown.

 [ íπ ]  EAST ROOM
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Characters in this room (listed east to west):

 (Top Row)      Aerith, Barret, Tifa, Shinra Soldier, a Honeybee Inn
                worker, and Rude.
 (Bottom Row)   Sephiroth, a Costa Del Sol lady, Chocobo Sage, Sailor,
                a dolphin, a cat, and a dog.
             
 When you enter this room, you'll get a message that welcomes you to the
 English Version of FF7.

 If you press Select while in this area to put the cursor on your head,
 then press it again, a menu comes up:

 R1: Reset Flag  (pressing Square also brings up this message)
 R2: Name & Money Change
 L1: Battle On / Off
 L2: Set Normal Party
 Select: Help On / Off

 - Pressing R2 once gives you no money and the default character names
   (Cloud, Tifa, etc.).  Press it again to get 131071 gil and no names
   for your characters.
 - Pressing L1 either turns the battle option off, or causes a small
   window to appear.  Running around doesn't produce any random battles,
   though.
 - R1 and L2 seem to have no effect, aside from displaying a message and
   giving you a sound effect.
 - Note that you don't need to have the menu on-screen in order to use
   these options.

 She says "Working Now".  Once you clear this message with the Circle
 button, you see the sequence when Tifa is reminiscing on Cloud's past.

 Selecting "Be Girl" puts you in Wall Market in Cloud's "girl" disguise,
 with all of the Wall Market items (cologne, lingerie, tiaras, etc.)
 However, nothing happens if you go to Don Corneo's, so you're stuck
 in Wall Market.

 Characters in this room:  Aerith, a doctor, and a nurse

 The music playing in this room is the Chocobo riding theme.  If you go
 to your status menu, the name of this room is 'dark city fourth street'.

 Upon entering this room, you get the following two options.

 for those in a hurry
 for those with a little time

 Picking the 'hurry' option brings up a menu similar to Aeris' menu, but
 the last option takes you to the Ultima Weapon's arrival in Mideel
 instead of the 'hades' option.  Picking the 'time' option lets you
 walk around and talk to the characters.

 MAN IN MAIN ROOM

 Talking to him produces the following options:

 MOVIE UNLOCK
 GLOBAL RESET
 FULL NAME
 NEW START
 EXIT

 (next leads to)

 BACK
 SOUND RESET
 FULL MATERIA
 BATTLE999
 EXIT

 Choosing Full Materia gives you three of each materia, including the
 removed japanese ones!  (Housoku, rifuab, etc.)

 Sound Reset turns off whatever music is playing.

 Battle999 puts you in a test battle against several of the Gold
 Pyramids that Reno creates when you fight him in Sector 7.  Beat them
 to return to the main screen.
 

 ========================================================================
 4.  JAPANESE / ENGLISH DIFFERENCES
 ========================================================================

 There is no background pic (blue circles, logos, etc.) for the Japanese
 main room, which seems odd.  Perhaps it's a defect of the code?  All
 the locations are still there if you walk in the desired directions
 though (this is hard to do since the exit points aren't shown in the
 Japanese version).

 In the US version, talking to Zangan made two small boxes appear.  In
 the Japanese version, talking to him produces a check of the kana,
 kanji, and symbols.

 Talking to Barret gives you a list of who you want to have in your
 party, including 16-year old Cloud (the one from the flashback).  In
 the English version, you got a little window with unlisted options.

 Talking to the little girl who takes you to the "death of Zack"
 sequence does nothing (since that was added in the English version).
 Instead, she says "Party no saraba (cloud)".

 There is no message in the East Room that welcomes you to the English
 version of FFVII.

 Talking to the Aerith who says "Working Now." just takes you to the
 room in Sector 7 where the save point bounces around (the same as
 the first of Barret's options).  Again, this is because the scene
 where Tifa reminisces about watching over Cloud was only added into
 the English release.

 When you use the 'Battle999' option, it's much neater than in the US
 version.  Instead of a black background, you're standing on a large
 Shinra logo with a gold backdrop, and you're fighting several monsters
 called Test 2: Deenglow (and they look like Deenglows) instead of the
 jibberish used to describe the enemies in the US version (which look
 like gold pyramids).  However, their stats. are still the same, and
 beating them still gives you lots of AP, EXP, and 5 Turbo Ethers, just
 like in the US version.

 I also confirmed that when you use the Materia Full option, you get all
 of the Materia in the game, including the disabled materia.  In the
 US version, none of the disabled ones had names, but in this one they
 do (Housoku, Baria, Booster, etc.)  Remember that in the US version,
 the useless materia "Suichuu Kokyuu" became the "Underwater" materia
 used in the Emerald Weapon fight.  What's really weird is that you
 a couple of extra materia (purple and blue, in either version) with no
 name or function.  I had assumed that these were just glitch materia
 back when I was making GameShark codes for the Japanese version (since
 all glitch materia had the same stats.), but since the game's code
 actually sticks these in your inventory, I guess they were going to be
 used for something.

 Note that the 'Materia Max' option offered by Barret glitches the game
 (instead of giving you a slew of Bahamut orbs like it does in the US
 version).

 Translation-wise, most of what the characters say to you (like Aerith
 joking that you're in Hades) remains true to the Japanese version.
 The Japanese found in the English version is usually just fragments
 of what the characters actually say to you in the Japanese version
 (where it's all full sentences).  The one change I noticed is that
 the made-up names in the English version (alator, Cait Sithers!, Ol',
 Ionia, Princess, and so on), are not in the Japanese version (the
 default names are used instead.  I guess the translators just had some
 fun when naming the debug mode characters ;)
