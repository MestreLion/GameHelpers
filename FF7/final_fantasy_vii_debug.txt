New: It's been a long while since I last updated this FAQ, but since 
the last edition I've become rather unsatisfied with the general 
layout and structure of the guide, so changes have been made.
You'll now find little maps of all the debug rooms so you'll no longer
have to spend an age working out who the hell I'm referring to by saying 
things like "Tifa 47 - next to the left side of Cloud 24", or whatever.

If you're a Gameshark owner, please check out the new improved code 
section for a joker code that will let you use the debug room properly.
In fact you may as well check the codes section anyway, as there are 
now Joker codes for the FF versions so you no longer have to keep 
flicking your AR switch on and off. I've also now got the American 
version of FF7 as well as the PAL one, so I can check any findings 
involving codes, etc that you moght have regarding that version.

There are also a few new additions to the miscellaneous sections and other 
more in-depth sections of the guide, so I recommend you read through them.


ANNOUNCEMENT: There is now a (pictorialised) HTML version of this FAQ available
on the following address:-

i.am/lzj/

This is Lau Zhen-Jock's FF7 page, and you'll find lots of useful FF7 information
as well as a truly collossal set of links and other resources like message boards 
and more. He has painstakingly copied out virtually all of this FAQ and formatted
it in easy to follow HTML along with a large selection of pictures to illustrate 
how to do certain things, etc, and it really is a must see if you're even slightly 
interested in the debug room and/or this FAQ.

WANTED: Can anyone create an NTSC version of the Joker code? (see code section for
details)
Also, can anyone make a PAL version of the 'Kill Sephiroth' code? (see 'The Super
deluxe guide to getting Sephiroth' section at the end of the guide).


NOTICE:
------

This FAQ can ONLY be freely distributed as long as it is done so in IT'S ENTIRETY and
is unaltered. This FAQ CANNOT be used commercially or otherwise reprinted or
incorporated into any commercial medium. It is FOR PRIVATE USE ONLY.

THIS FAQ IS FOR THE PAL VERSION OF FF7. AS FAR AS I KNOW IT IS THE SAME AS THE
AMERICAN VERSION, BUT THIS IS NOT CERTAIN.
(But judging by the effort put into the PAL conversion - i.e. zero, it is pretty
likely the games are the same. The Japanese version, however is DEFINITELY NOT the
same. Read Kao Megura's FAQ for that version (thanks for the mention BTW :) )).  


Introduction
============

Like most Playstation owners I had bought and enjoyed Final Fantasy VII from
Squaresoft. I had played the game to death, solved every puzzle, collected
every item and found every secret, it seemed that I had would have to wait for
FF VIII for my next FF fix. But then I heard about the secret debug room. I
didn't believe it at first, and as I have the PAL version of the game I
couldn't see it for my own eyes. Then someone came up with the PAL version of
the code and it blew my mind. This must be the most comprehensive debug mode of
any game ever, it lets you start at any point in the game with any characters
and any items. I decided to catalog the confusing menus and options so that I
could actually work out ways to use it rather then just mess about with it.

All you need to access the room is a Gameshark or Action Replay cartridge, some
patience, and this guide. Included are codes for nearly every FF7 version (the 
only version that there isn't a code for is Japanese FF7 International, at least 
that I know of). I hope you enjoy reading this FAQ and have fun discovering some 
of the weird secrets of Final Fantasy VII.

How To Use This Guide
=====================

I'm not trying to be patronising, but it has really become noticable that some
people - far from not reading the instructions - have become confused as to the 
layout of the guide and where to find the information they want. I originally split
the guide into themed sections so that you can quickly find what you want, but as the
versions have piled up the debug rooms section has hidden the other sections away 
under hundreds of lines of options.
I intended the guide to work as follows:

Debug rooms breakdown (Sections 1-4):-
This is the bulk of the guide and simply consists of a huge list of every option
and what they do. If you've been looking through the rooms and want to know what
option X does, then look here.

Frequently Asked Questions (Section 7):-
This is possibly the most useful section of the FAQ. It is designed not only to
let you quickly see if any problems you may have had have been previously answered,
but also covering useful little tricks and tips for the debug room. 
Basically, if you want to know ANYTHING interesting that can be achieved 
via the debug room, look here first.

Miscellaneous (Section 5):- 
This section goes hand in hand with the FAQ section. It offers an in depth 
explanation of some useful and strange tricks in the debug rooms, as well as
providing further explanations of parts of the main debug room guide.
 
You see, it's simple. I hope you didn't find that too tedious or patronising,
but I figured that if by writing this I could stop another ten people asking
"How do I get Sephiroth?", then it would be worthwhile..

Code to play the terrible PAL version in NTSC (not perfect, but still better
than PAL. Can anyone fix the screen position?).

PAL to NTSC code: D0051464 0001
                  80051464 0000

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:
===== ============
(Read this CAREFULLY before you use the code).

1. Enter the code into your GS/AR as usual. (For the N.America release, enter
both the provided codes. BTW, this new code fixes some graphical glitches.)

2. Start the game with the code active.

3. Either select 'New Game' to start in the debug room with a level 1 party, or select
'Load Game' to start with a saved party (then enter any town or 'field screen' to get 
to the debug room).

4. Once the debug room has loaded, SWITCH OFF the GS/AR (you cannot enter the other 
debug rooms otherwise).

5. To get back to the debug room, either select an option from a character in one of 
the other debug rooms with the switch on, or if you are in the actual game walk off 
any exit in the game with the switch on (as long as it dosen't lead to the world map 
screen).

6. ALWAYS SWITCH OFF THE CODE WHEN ENTERING THE WORLD MAP SCREEN.


GAMESHARK OWNERS READ THIS:
========= ====== ==== ====

Several people have written to me complaining that they cannot enter 
any of the other rooms except the main debug room, despite switching 
the code off. After further investigation it seems that certain 
versions of gameshark do not disable the code properly, so the code 
is permanently on preventing access to the other rooms. If you have 
this problem (and are SURE that you have switched the code off), 
then try the following solution:

1. Load the game with the code on as usual.
2. Once you are in the debug room, talk to Yuffie and select 'MENU ON'.
3. Now save the game to your memory card.
4. Reset the Playstation.
5. Load the game up again, but this time DO NOT SWITCH ON THE CODE AT ALL.
6. Load the saved game you made earlier.

There is one downside to this, you cannot re-enter the main debug room
unless you load the saved game again.


JOKER CODE INSTRUCTIONS:
===== ==== ============

These codes allow you to enter the debug room just by using your 
joypad, so you don't have to constantly switch on/off your AR/GS 
cartridge (a big help to people like me who have their Playstations in
awkward places). Enter the codes for your game version then load up 
the game with the switch left ON.  Now once you start actually playing
the game (either from a saved game, or once the sequence at the 
station appears at the start) go to the menu and choose 'config'.
Now go to the window colour box. Click on the top-left corner.

fig.1

          ---------------------------
HERE!--->|                           |
         |                           |
         |                           |
         |                           |
         |                           |
          ---------------------------

Now change the RED component of the RGB slider to '000' if it isn't 
already. Even if it is you MUST click on it once to activate the debug
code. Now the debug code is on and entering a new room will take you 
to it as before.

          
fig.2

         -------------------------------      
   R 000 []                             |
         -------------------------------
   G ???                                |
         -------------------------------
   B ???                                |
         -------------------------------

Changing the R value to anything greater '000' (e.g. '001') will 
switch the code off.  

To summarise:
change R to 000 to enter the debug room. Change R to 001 once you get 
there.
This may seem quite cumbersome at first, but pratice using it and 
you'll find it very useful. It also bypasses the problem with the 
Gameshark cartridge.

Big thanks to Dean Connell for providing me with this code.

Can anyone make an American version code? (I tried, but it didn't work..)

|------------------------|
+ 2.) The Main Debug Room+-----------------------------------------------------------
|------------------------|


This is the centre of the debug mode, allowing access to all the other rooms
and also back to the game itself. To get to the debug room, simply switch on
the code and walk into any normal field screen (NOT the map screen). Remember,
ALWAYS switch off the code when you go into the map screen mode, or something
very strange will happen...

The most useful feature of this room is Yuffie. Talk to her to bring up a
general menu with the following options:

    NEXT - Next set of options.

    MENU ON - Enables all menu options (i.e Save and PHS. Thanks to 
              'EsperFF6' for that one :) ) 

    BATTLE LOCK - Disables battles. (Try wandering around the map and see what
                                     happens...)
    BATTLE UNLOCK - Enables battles again.

    MOVIE LOCK - Skips all the movies.

    MOVIE UNLOCK - Enables movies again.

    GLOBAL RESET - Resets money and party.

    FULL NAME - Puts a load of gibberish in each characters name.
                (Also creates an interesting side effect - see 
                 miscellaneous section.)

    NEW START - Restarts the game as if 'NEW GAME' was selected on the title
                screen. (THIS ONLY WORKS WITH DISK 1!)

    EXIT - Cancels

Menu 2:
    BACK - Goes back.

    SOUND RESET - Resets sound effects/music.

    FULL MATERIA - Gives you all materia (that can fit in the list)

    BATTLE999 - Special battle against some pyramids (See end of guide).

    EXIT

Walking off the left side of the room (Marked 11 below) results in you
returning to the game outside Midgar. It is therefore recommended that you leave
your Chocobo/Highwind there. (MAKE SURE YOU SWITCH OFF THE CODE WHEN LEAVING!)


The 10 rooms are arranged in the following order:
(Room 11 is the exit.)

Room Order:
                             10

Some of the rooms have special debug keys which perform different operations.
These are outlined below:

Debug Keys:
===== ====

Room 1.
---- -

Select: Help menu for the below.
Square: "Reset Flag" - ?
L1: "Battle off" - switches off battles. Press again to re-enable.
L2: "Set Normal Party" - Gives you Cloud, Barret and Tifa in party.
R1: "Reset Flag" - ?
R2: "Default Name&No Money" - just as it says.
R2 (again): Debug Name&Debug Money" - removes all names and gives you 131071
            gil.
Room 2.
---- -

NONE

Room 3.
---- -

Square: "1P" (press again for:) "2P" - This changes the options for 
all the characters in the room.
L1: "Debug [Number]" - Determines whether the game was started from 'New Game' 
or 'Load Game' option. 0 is a new game, 8 is a saved game.

Rooms 4-10 have no debug keys.

|---------------------------------|
+ 3.) SOME USEFUL HINTS AND TIPS: +--------------------------------------------------
|---------------------------------|

*. If you want to play a specific part of the game, put in the correct disk for
that part. Although, as you may know, you can play through FF7 on the wrong disk
usually, doing so with some debug options will crash the game rather than just 
showing the wrong films, etc.

*. Many parts of the game will be in the state that you have previously left them
in. For example, if you load up a save from the end of the game and then enter 
the debug room and go to the Temple of the Ancients, many parts will not work/not
work properly as in your game the temple no longer exists.

*. ALWAYS SWITCH OFF THE CODE IN BOSS BATTLES! Otherwise even if you win you
will see the game over screen..
This also happens in 'scripted' battles (e.g. the 2 guards in the train station at
the start of the game, or the guards when Yuffie steals your materia).

*. Take nothing for granted. Just because an option says 'cancel' or 'quit' 
dosen't mean it does..

*. Adding to the first point, in scenes where a certain character MUST be in
your party (e.g. Cait Sith at the Gold Saucer) make sure they are or the game
may behave strangely, or hang.

*. Remember, if anything goes horribly wrong you can always restart the game by 
holding all the shoulder buttons, and start and select together. Even if the game
seems to have totally gone up the wall this often still works. If not, you'll 
have to reset.. (having said that, you should always be patient, as at least a few
options appear to hang the game or just not respond to commands, but after a few 
minutes they will work again).

*. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE! Walking about with Aeris, Sephiroth and Young Cloud 
whilst using disabled materia is not likely to make the game play very reliably.. 

*. Beware of parts of the game that put Tifa or Cid in charge, as they have a 
nasty habit of messing up the debug room. This dosen't always happen, but has 
happened enough times to annoy me.

*. Options that have [] (Picture of PSX square button) or "R1 de mage" have another
function that will only be shown if you hold the corresponding button down whilst
selecting (keep it held until it has loaded).

*. If you start from a new game, avoid any thing that leads to the PHS screen, as
without any other characters you will be stuck there unless you reset the 
Playstation.

Walking in this area (#) will result in the floor talking to you..



"For those in a hurry" - Takes you to Aeris menu
"For those with a little time" - Lets you walk around

I recommend you use the "in a hurry" menu, as otherwise the characters don't appear.

              You ready for your journey?"
  "So? Where to?"

   To Mideel! - Mideel before it has been destroyed. (Characters are invisible and the 
                game often hangs).
   To Mideel Clinic! - Scene where Cloud is in hospital and Tifa is watching him 
                       (characters are invisible again..).
   
   To the Mideel Talk Event! - Game hangs unless you talk to the Doctor first
                               (See below).

   To Hades! - Sarcastic comment from Aeris..
   
NOTE: Choosing "For those in a hurry", produces the same results, but the bottom 
option is  now "Hold it, I need a break!", which leads to the battle with WEAPON.
The other options are the same, but seem to work much more reliably.


Nurse:  "Who're you going with?"
    Lets you change party members.

Doctor: "Take down a flag?"

   Mideel - Mideel destroyed flag(?) Switch this on to enable the "Mideel

Man (Next to Tifa):
These options all work by setting flags of what has and hasn't been done by the
player. It is almost impossible to test a lot of these options fairly, as leaving
the debug room puts you by Midgar. This is a problem because you need the Highwind to
investigate the changes. Also, by using the Highwind option it sets the game to after
you have got the highwind, cancelling out options/events before it.

           enter any houses or exits. In short you are stuck!

+ 5.) Miscellaneous: +---------------------------------------------------------------
|--------------------|

*. THE DATE SCENE:

One of the most amusing things you can do in FF7 is 'date' all the female characters,
as well as Barret (NO, it's NOT like that :) ). Usually it requires you to be kind/
unkind to different characters to decide which of them you will go with. Each time you
choose certain options you are adding or subtracting to each characters total of how
many 'love points' they have recieved from your actions. 
By using the debug room you can bypass playing through the game and skip right to the
'good stuff'. The only problem is which character is chosen.
In view of this I formulated a plan of how to 'date' each character:

1. Go to room 3.

2. Talk to the Aeris on the far right.

3. Select "un" and choose Cloud, the character you want to go with (out of Aeris,
Tifa, Yuffie, and Barret), and finally "inai".

4. Press the square button (you should see "2P" appear)

5. Talk to the top Yuffie. Choose "date no osasoi".

6. Et Voila!

You can do this the hard way by setting the number of points for each character,
but I can't seem to get Barret this way.

*. Chocobo stats:

It is extremely difficult to work out what all the statistics in the Chocobo
screen menu mean, but here is what I have found:

TSP: Maximum Stamina

TS: Current Stamina

SPP: Maximum Speed

SP: Current Speed

ST: ? (maybe this is stamina after all)

AC: Acceleration?

T: Intelligence (out of 100).

LOY: Loyalty. How well the Chocobo behaves (100 is best).

CHR: ?

CHCT: ?

SEX: 0 Male
     1 Female

COL: (Colour)
     0 Normal
     1 Green
     2 Blue
     3 Black
     6 Gold

CL: Number of times Chocobo has been ridden in a race (or races won?).

R: ? (Always seems to be 2)


*. Weird Things:

Something extremely strange and interesting:

1. Enter the debug room through the 'New Game' option.
2. Go to room 2.
3. Talk to the Sailor and select 'shinra airship'.
4. now go outside..

Not only are you not in the submarine, but you are piloting the Key of the 
Ancients! Even stranger, you can actually ride over the edges of the ocean cliffs
and sail over the land. Somewhat pointlessly the topography of the normal map has
been roughly preserved, so you can sail over the whole of the landscape. The map
in the bottom of the screen dosen't appear to work properly, as it seems that there
are exact copies of the sea floor scattered around the place. It would be interesting 
to see whether there are any other areas you can explore that are not usually accessible.

Thanks to 'Sanagi' for this. (Seems to be an expert at finding weird things :) ).

Start a New game and go to room 4. Talk to the nurse and select "I'm starting over"
Now select "princess" This turns you into the giant Aeris.

Again, thanks to Sanagi for that.


*. Room 4 has lots of strange in jokes. In particular, try walking on the
talking floor, or choosing "To Hades!", from the Giant Aeris menu.
(Presumably due to the tedium of constant bug testing..)

*.SUPER ARMOR

V.IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THIS CHEAT ON YOUR CHARACTER'S ULTIMATE 
WEAPONS. You will not get them back. In fact, you should equip your 
characters with the worst armour and weapons you can find (i.e. 
initial weapons which you can't sell anyway) before you use this 
cheat (that goes for accessories, too) as they will be lost forever 
otherwise.

My good friend Vishy discovered an interesting side effect of the 
"full name" option:-

In the Main Debug room, talk to Yuffie and choose "FULL NAME". This 
will mess up the characters names, but more importantly mess up the 
weapon and armor statistics..

Now when you return back to the game you will be practically 
invincible. Every attack made apon you by the enemy will miss, or if 
they are lucky enough to actually hit you then the damage will 
actually HEAL you like using elemental defence! I haven't tested this 
out that thoroughly yet, (like against instant death attacks) but it 
definitely deflects ANY kind of physical attack and I think all the 
magic attacks. In theory this should also work on enemies such as the 
WEAPONS and even Sephiroth! I haven't tested this yet, but it 
certainly seems conceivable. Thanks a lot Vish!

BUG/SIDE EFFECT NOTE:
Rob Bill mailed me to say that when you use this cheat the third 
character will have 'Death Sentence' cast apon them as soon as battle 
commences. To get round this, simply equip the third character with a 
Ribbon to counteract the problem.


*. The Pyramids...

PYRAMID (real name is unknown)

LEVEL: 4
HP: 10
MP: 200
EXP: 500000
GIL: 500000
AP: 10000

Appear in a group of 5.
The Pyramids do not attack or respond at all to the player. they are 
very easy to destroy, but only physically disappear when instant death
is used on them (This has led to the misconception that they are 
extremely tough, but in reality they are easily beaten but don't 
disappear). Obviously you must hit every single pyramid to win the 
match. This is an incredibly easy way to earn levels in seconds. You 
can build up a party of level 1 characters up to level 99 in under one
minute. Using 'Exp plus' materia makes the process even faster.

Pyramid properties:-

The pyramids can be manipulated but have no attacks. 
Cannot be morphed or stolen from.
Can be poisoned - but dies straight away anyway..
Can be silenced.
Can be confused! - they spin around.
Can be 'mini'ed and 'toad'ed (needs multiple attempts)
Can be 'beserk'ed - turn red.
Can be sent to sleep.
You can use the enemy skill 'L4 suicide' on them (I expect the reason why
they are at level 4 is for testing this).
Can be 'sense'ed.
Can be killed by 'instant death' attacks.

Each Pyramid gives you a Turbo Ether when killed.

Thanks to 'Vegeta3485' for pointing out that the pyramids can actually
be minied/toaded.

INTERESTING UPDATE:
Zach Fisher mailed me with a strange observation. He found that if you
attacked the Pyramid in the far back row (middle) the battle would end
immediately, without even touching the other pyramids. I experimented 
with this and I found that as he said, you could win by just attacking
the back pyramid. What was stranger though, was that if you attack any
other pyramid first and then attacked the back pyramid you would 
still have to defeat all 5 pyramids to win.

Use this little tip and you can earn levels even faster than before. 


*. THE SUPER-DELUXE GUIDE TO GETTING SEPHIROTH!

As you probably know, you can use the debug room to add Sephiroth to 
your party. However, getting him and making use of him can be 
difficult. Here are some usefull tips:

TO GET SEPHIROTH

The basic question. The best way to get Sephiroth is to do the 
following:

1. Load up the game with the code on. USE DISK 1 and select "NEW GAME".
The reason for this is that if you enter the debug room with Vincent 
in your party, then it makes your probability of getting Sephiroth to 
plummet to almost nothing (it is nearly impossible to get Sephiroth 
once you have Vincent, or even reach a part of the game where you 
Could get Vincent).

2. Go to debug room 2 and talk to Sephiroth and choose his bottom 
(blank) option. Now you'll be back in the main debug room. 

3. Check the menu screen and if you see the name Sephiroth and his 
portrait, then the chances are that you have got a 'working' 
Sephiroth. Now you can do whatever you want with him.

SEPHIROTH - ABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS

Why bother getting Sephiroth? Aside from looking good, Sephiroth has a
useful trick up his sleeve - he's invincible. Although his attacks are
not that powerful, Sephiroth cannot be hurt by ANYTHING. In fact, I 
think the only thing that can hurt him is Ruby WEAPON's "whirlsand" 
attack (and this only removes him from battle). Having trouble beating
the WEAPONs? Then try using Sephiroth and sit back and wait.. It'll 
take a LONG while, but eventually he'll beat them - on his own if need
be. 
This highlights a major advantage/disadvantage of sephiroth - you 
can't control his actions in battle. No matter what you do, Sephiroth 
will always just attack, and use magic where appropriate. There is no 
way to control him yourself.

Actually, that's not quite true..

HOW TO CONTROL SEPHIROTH IN BATTLES

Sorry about the rather vague info on this subject in previous FAQ 
versions. To make up for it, here is the info "straight form the 
horses mouth". Take it away LZJ!

"Put Sephiroth in your party and use the order command to put him in the
first slot. Now enter a battle and use the following code:-  800F840C 0000
His HP should be 0 now but he will still be alive and his HP is in yellow
colour . It doesn't matter. Just win the battle and remember to switch of
this code. Now if you enter the menu screen, you should find that
Sephiroth's HP is now 0. Now enter another battle again and you will notice
that Sephiroth is standing but he is not moving(cause they didn't make a
dead animation for him). Now use phoenix down or life on him to revive him.
Upon his revival, you should be able to control him. This doesn't happen
without side-effects however, cause he will no longer be invincible and he
is just like any character just that he looks good. Notice that you will
have to repeat this process every time you enter battle, so if you really
want him, just kill him before the end of each battle (he is no longer
invincible so you can kill him)."

NOTE: This will not work if you use the 'BATTLE999' option in the debug room
to enter a battle. It will only work if done in the game proper. 

Big thanks to LZJ for finding this in the first place and giving more 
detailed info after I was too lazy ("busy") to properly test this. 

Could anyone make a PAL version of the above code?

*. On-screen Character change

A big update to the 'play as Giant Aeris' tip discovered by Phfor.

Tired of playing as Cloud all the time? Try this:

1. Go to room 4.

2. Talk to the Nurse.

3. Select "I'm starting over".

4. Talk to her again.

5. This time select the character you want to play as (e.g. Red XIII).

6. Now talk to Aeris in that room and choose "To Mideel Clinic!".

You should now appear as the character you selected earlier.

This works with all the characters, but you should be aware as there 
are a lot of weird things that can potentially happen. This little 
cheat definitely should only be used for a bit of fun, never try and 
play the game like this as there are lots of problems and side effects
and the game is very likely to crash.

Big thanks to Phfor for telling me about this.

+ 7.) Frequently Asked Questions+----------------------------------------------------
|-------------------------------|

AERIS

Q. I want to resurrect Aeris. How do I do it?

A: There are several ways, but this is the most reliable:

   1. Enter room 9.
   2. Talk to Barret.
   3. Choose the fifth option from the invisible menu (push down four times).
   You Now have Aeris back! To get her in top condition you'll have to do this:

   Limit break Manual:
   4. Go to room 3.
   5. Talk to the bottom Yuffie. Select "item iroiro" for Aeris's limit break.

   Maximum stats:
   6. in the main debug room talk to Yuffie and choose "BATTLE999" and kill the
   pyramids until Aeris reaches level 99 (takes about 4 turns without 'Exp plus'
   materia).
   7. Give her loads of the Power and Speed sources you'll have got from Yuffie.

   Best Weapon:
   8. Go to Tifa in room 6. Select option 3. Now you can give Aeris the 
   Umbrella, her best weapon. Note that it has NO Materia slots at 
   all, however.

SEPHIROTH

Q. I want to play as Sephiroth. How?

A: It is very difficult to get a reliable Sephiroth (ie. actually appears in
battles, etc.), but try this:

   1. Go to room 2.
   2. Talk to the Sailor and choose last Dungeon. (If you go back to the debug
      room you may lose Sephiroth)
   3. Get back in the Highwind and have fun with Sephiroth!
NOTE: this can be a bit hit and miss. Sometimes it will work perfectly, other 
times it won't.

Also, try reading the 'Miscellaneous' section for more info on this.

GOLD CHOCOBO

Q. I Want A Gold Chocobo. How do I cheat?

A: Tsk. Do the following:
(Make sure you have an empty Chocobo stable first).
   1. Go to room 2.
   2. Talk to the fat bloke. Choose "After Armegedon"
   3. Choose "yes", then "get DESERT ROSE", and finally "event start".
   4. Go outside and into the nearest house and go upstairs.
   5. Talk to the old man twice. Talk to the Chocobo, and he's yours!

ITEMS

Q. I want the Guide book/I want the items you get for killing weapon(s), but I
   can't be bothered to kill them..

A: Do the same as for the last question, but select get [item name] for all the
items.

Q. I want character X/Y/Z's limit break. Where can I get 'em?

A: Here:

   1. Go to room 3.
   2. Talk to the bottom Yuffie. Choose "item iroiro". Simple.

Q. How can I get all those 'source' things?

A: Do the same as for the above question To get speed and power sources. Or do 
   the same as the question below to get 99 of all of them:

Q. How can I get every item?

A: Talk to Tifa in room 6. Select option 3.

WATCHING THE CGI FILMS

Q. I want to watch all the excellent CGI films. How do I do it?

A: There are several film viewers, but they are very unreliable and unfriendly 
to use. The best ones IMHO are:

    1. Go to room 2 and talk to sephiroth and select 'use'. This is the best player
    (IMHO) as it plays the films with the correct music and follows past any cuts in 
    the film, etc. It also checks for the correct disk for once as well.

    2. Go to room 6 and talk with Yuffie. ONLY DO THIS WITH DISK 2 INSERTED (I can't 
    get it to work with any other disk). Choosing 'plus' skips a film.

There are others, but they either play only 1 or 2 specific films or crash badly.

Q. I want to watch the end film(s). How?

A: Unfortunately there is no direct way to jump to the end sequence via the debug
room. The best solution I have come up with is as follows: 

Firstly, you must have a high level (i.e Lv99) party, and the Knights Of The Round 
materia. If you don't have these then use the debug room to get them as explained
above.

Once you've done all that equip your people with the appropriate materias, etc then
go to debug room 3.

Talk to 'Tifa 3', and choose LAS4-4. This will take you to the very end of the game
just before the fight with Jenova (I tried to start off even closer to the end then 
this, but the game either crashes or you get in an endless loop fighting Sephiroth at
the end if you do..). Use Knights Of The Round. On the next fight use Knights Of The 
Round. On the next fight use KOTH twice. You'll now be able to watch the ending.

If anyone has found a better way, or a way that to make the other options near the
end work properly, then please tell me.

MINIGAMES

Q. I want to play X/Y minigame. Where are they?

   Highway Bike Game: Room 2. Talk to the sailor. Select "HIGHWAY minigame"
                      Room 5. Talk to Dyne, and select minigame.
 
   Submarine Game: Room 1. Talk to the sailor and select "minigame X".
   The number X is the game version (difficulty).

   Snowboarding Game: Room 7, talk to Aeris.

   Fort Condor Battle game: Go to room 6. Talk to the wrestler. 1-6 changes the 
   difficulty, and 'last one' is the Huge materia version (hardest).

MUSIC PLAYER

Q. I want to listen to all the music. Is there a music player?

A: No. Try looking in the 'miscellaneous' section for some music locations.

Q. The characters have all been given stupid names like 'Princess' or 'Ballet'.
How the hell do I change them back?

A: Try going to a different debug room to change them back, or do the following:

   1. Go to room 3 and talk to the shaking Cloud.
   2. Select 'ima..'
   3. Choose your character to rename. 

BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS

Q. Can I change my onscreen character to someone else? Like Sephiroth?

A: This is possible, but totally unreliable. 
   Read the Miscellaneous section for a detailed description of how to
   play as every playable  character in the game. Alternatively, try:
    
   1. Going to room 3 will turn Cloud into Cloud with his sword drawn. 

   2. You can make Tifa and Cid as leaders as would happen in some parts of the 
      game normally. 

   3. It is possible to appear as Sephiroth holding Jenova's head, but I haven't 
      been able to repeat this. 

   4. Also selecting a certain option will return you to the game looking like Lucretia, 
   but unfortunatley you are stuck in a wall making this useless..

   5. It is possible to appear as the giant Aeris in room 4.


Q. Yuck! The debug room graphics are all messed up. I won't stand for this, how do I
change it back!?

A: If you have the N.American version, use the improved code as well as the old one. 
If not, try going to room 2, talking to Sephiroth and selecting the bottom invisible option.


Q. What the hell is the strange mess you see when you go to the world map with the 
switch on?

A: This makes the game display the world map with the 'snow wasteland' effect seen in 
   the Great Glacier section of the game. you cannot control the camera or enter 
   any town, you can only walk around and fight random battles. If you start a new 
   game and end up here you see the instructions that you receive when you get here in 
   the game proper. The only way out of here is to reset the game (L1+L2+R1+R2+Select+Start),
   or switch off the Playstation and start again. 
You can avoid this screen appearing by using the improved code for the American version.

THE 'DATE' SEQUENCE

Q. I want to date Tifa/Yuffie/Barret. How?

A: Try looking in the 'miscellaneous' section for a guide to this.  

That's all for now..

This FAQ will always be available from these sites:

Note: This version of the FAQ is the 'official' HTML FAQ. However, it is created
independently of this version. It contains the same information, but is fully
illustrated and more user friendly than a text-based FAQ could ever be. If you see
any errors (ONLY EXLCUSIVELY) in the HTML version, please report them to 
Lau Zhen-Jock (he has kindly created and maintained the HTML version for me) at 
the following address: 
zehnjock@mypad.com
If the error is in the original FAQ text, then obviously report it to me (Andrew 
Dean).
