EDITOR'S NOTE:  Here is version 1.06 of the walkthrough for Final
                Fantasy VII.  Please note that this guide will assume
                that you have at least a minimal understanding of 
                Japanese (katakana & hiragana), due to the extensive 
                length & gameplay of this epic saga.
			
                For details on operating the window control menus, 
                how to save, info on best equipting the materia, 
                and of the sort, please refer to the "Reference Section",
                which is located towards the end of this guide.

                For details on the various secrets & tricks encountered
                so far in FFVII, please refer to the "Tips & Tricks
                Section", which is located right after the Reference
                Section.

                It is also recommended that you view this document in 
                a font with a [fixed width] such as courier, as the 
                layout for this walkthrough has been optimized in using 
                the courier font.  But just a suggestion, of course.

                On a final note, I HIGHLY urge you to only use this 
                walkthrough on a minimal basis and on certain instances
                where you may find yourself "stuck" without any other
                options to spare - as the only greatest reward achieved 
                from playing an epic rpg as Final Fantasy VII is truly 
                the feeling of accomplishment through your own efforts...

KEY:  [!] = Decision Point.  You will be given choices in response to
            the various interaction with the characters & environment.  
            Note that the majority of the choices encountered in 
            FFVII have a certain level of significance in the course
            of your saga.  In certain decision points, you will be 
            given only 1 chance to answer them correctly, so be aware 
            of your actions....
  
   [Tip!] = Tip point. (duh)  From time to time, little advises 
            on certain situations will be given, for assisting you 
            in solving certain sequence of events without completely 
            losing the game's innovative appeal due to using this
            walkthrough or "cheat" as some would say....

    [^o^] = Secret/trick point.  In the course of your epic saga, 
            there will be various opportunities to find secret artifacts,
            hidden events & sequences, or little added bonuses.  
            Some events require that you accomplish a certain sequence,
            while others are merely well hidden.  Advises & solutions 
            will be provided to help you cover as much of those secrets 
            that the wizards at Squaresoft have managed to hide within
            these 3CDs...

    [OP!] = Optional Event.  There will be several optional/side events 
            throughout the course of your journeys - none of which will 
            have any effect to the primary storyline, whether if you take 
            part in the optional side events or not.  These optional side
            events are, however, great opportunities to obtain certain 
            special artifacts or even a hidden materia or two...

[ FFVII Walkthrough : DISK 1 ] 
========================================================================

[1.]---[ Inside Area 1 of Makoro Industrial Complex ]
   
    o Proceeding the introductory sequence, as you along with the 
      few resistance members, known as the "abaranche", leap off the 
      train, Barrett will urge you to hurry & follow.
    
    o Battle your way up to the outer gate of the industrial complex -
      the rest of the resistance members (Vicks, Wedge, JC) will be 
      waiting there for you.

    o Talk to Vicks.  He will then ask for you name.
      (refer to the Reference Section for details on the control 
       interface of the name screen)
       
      As the gate is opened and the resistance members proceed through, 
      go ahead & customize Barrett's name to your own preference, 
      or leave it as is.

    o Battle your way through the industrial levels of the Makoro 
      complex - talk to JC in order to open the 2 gates.
      Upon reaching the elevator, JC will tell you to push the 
      elevator controls.  Upon leaving the elevator, JC will 
      later stop to tell you the controls to maneuvering around 
      the ladder & beams.   (Press Circle button to leap onto ladder)
                            (Use directional pad to maneuver)
 
    o Upon reaching the core level of the Makoro complex, Cloud will   
      proceed to initiate the bomb.  Prepare for a battle sequence 
      w/the level boss.

    o You will then have 10 minutes to escape the Makoro complex.
      Well, what are you waiting for?  RUN!
      (Make sure not to leave anyone behind inside the complex)

    o Upon successfully making your escape, Barrett will tell everyone 
      to meet at the train station.
  
    o Shortly after, you will encounter Aerith for the very first time.
      (At this early point in the game, she is identified only as 
       a young girl selling flowers)
      Aerith will approach you to ask what had happened.
 
[!]  You will be given a choice to respond:
        Top Choice -> Tell Aerith to escape/run as well
     Bottom Choice -> Tell Aerith not to worry...and

[!]  If you choose the bottom choice, you will be given another choice:
        Top Choice -> Show interest in Aerith's flowers
     Bottom Choice -> Nevermind

[!]  If you choose the top choice & show interest in Aerith's flowers, 
     Aerith will offer to sell you some flowers.  You can respond:

        Top Choice -> Buy the flowers for 1 Gil 
     Bottom Choice -> Do not buy

[Tip!] - If you choose to buy the flowers, there will be a little
         "bonus" scene that will occur later on at the bar in the slum 
         town of Agito w/Tifa & Marin.  

   o After Aerith gives you the flowers, proceed on through the Area 8
     city.  Guards will be lurking around -- You will even be given 
     choices if you want to confront the guards or not.
     (Choose the top choice to fight them, the bottom to run)
     (Note: You will only have a few seconds to make this decision)

   o Upon making your leaping escape onto the train & gather back 
     together w/the abaranche/resistance, talk to everyone.
     You will need to talk to JC for information on the structure 
     & foundation of Midgar (how the cities are divided into 
     8 subsections and named w/numerical area values - i.e. Area 8)
     and the Shinra corporation.  He later goes on to explain how 
     each of the 8 subsections have ID censor checkpoints which are 
     interconnected to Shinra Corp's host computer.

     (If you talk to JC once more, he will suggest possibly giving you 
      a gift that he made. - Choose the top choice to deny it, or 
      choose the bottom choice to accept it if & when he does have it)

   o Upon reaching the train station of Area 7, Barrett will tell 
     everyone to head to the slum town of Agito.  Follow them.
      
[2.]---[ Slum Town of Agito: Abaranche Headquarters ]

   o Head into the bar - the rest of the Abaranche/resistance 
     members will be there, as well as Barrett's daughter (Marin)  
     and Tifa.

     After Marin mistakes you for her father, Barrett, Tifa will 
     approach you, welcoming you back.  Tifa will first ask 
     you if you had any quarrels with Barrett during your mission.
   
[!]  You can respond:
        Top Choice -> Tell Tifa you quarreled/argued with Barrett
     Bottom Choice -> Tell Tifa you restrained/held yourself from 
                      quarreling with Barrett

     If you chose the bottom choice, Tifa will complement you
     in a surprised manner that you are acting more mature now.
     Name screen will pop up - customize Tifa's name to your 
     own preference or leave it as is.

   o If you bought those flowers earlier from Aerith, Tifa will 
     notice the flowers.  She will be surprised that you found 
     flowers in Midgar.
 
[!]  You will be given a choice - You can:

        Top Choice -> Give the flowers to Tifa
     Bottom Choice -> Give the flowers to Marin (Barrett's daughter)

     (I will leave this choice up to you -- although if you really 
      must know, I chose to give them to Tifa) (^o^)

   o Walk towards the entrance of the bar - Barrett will rush in.
     After Barrett & the rest of the Abaranche members head down 
     to the secret headquarters, talk to Tifa.

     (NOTE: Depending on who you gave the flowers to, will determine 
            what Tifa will say to you.  If you chose to give the flowers 
            to Marin (Barrett's daughter), Tifa will urge you to follow
            them down to the headquarters.)

[!]  If you chose to give the flowers to Tifa, she will offer a drink  
     to you.  You can respond:

        Top Choice -> Tell Tifa you do not feel like drinking at the 
                      moment.
     Bottom Choise -> Tell Tifa you want a sharp/heavy shot of liquor.
     
   o After the light conversation, Tifa will urge you to go down to 
     the headquarters.  As Cloud & Barrett once more get into an 
     arguement, Cloud emphasizes the fact that he feels no obligation
     to neither the Shinra Corp or the Abaranche, despite the fact that 
     he once used to be a "soldier".  
 
   o Head back to the bar level.
     Tifa will shortly follow after you, urging you to help Barrett
     & the Abaranche against the Shinra Corp.  Cloud states, as he 
     did before, that he has no interest in whether or not the planet
     is in danger of destruction.  Tifa argues how Cloud is so easily 
     willing to part away from the long friendship they had once shared 
     since they were young children.  

[!]  In response to this, you can respond:
        Top Choice -> Tell Tifa that what she speaks of is meaningless
                      (Similar to saying "Whatever" in English)
     Bottom Choice -> Tell Tifa solemnly that there is nothing else 
                      he can do....

     (Either choice will result in the same response)

     Tifa then continues to remind Cloud of his special "promise"...
     ...a promise Cloud made 7 years ago to which he would come save
     Tifa in the case if she were to ever be in trouble...

   o Barrett will shortly come in & give Cloud the money due to him 
     for the earlier mission, as promised.  Cloud then offers to 
     take part in the next mission for double the price - 3000 gil.
     
   o Head up to the bar level & talk to Barrett - he will tell you that
     the next target is the Area 5 Makoro industrial complex. 
     He will then ask you to teach him how to equipt & use the materia 
     orbs.

[!]  You will be given a choice - you can respond:
        Top Choice -> Although it is too much work, you will explain
     Bottom Choice -> It is too much work....
 
     Assuming you chose the top choice, a demo sequence will start, 
     showing the steps in how to equipt & use the materia orbs.
     For further details, please refer to the "Reference Section" 
     of this guide.

   o Tifa will also join in your character party.
     Before heading off to the train station, explore the town 
     and purchase any supplies you may need on your journey.
   
[3.]---[ Train Sequence - To Area 5 Makoro industrial complex ]

   o Proceed on boarding the train - a sequence will soon take place, 
     as the Shinra's ID scanning system will burst out in full alert.
     Follow & run past each train cart within the time frame given
     or the doors will lock.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Run!

   o Upon making your leaping escape from the train, proceed down the 
     train tunnel.  You will encounter a section gated off by the 
     laser barrier.  Just to the left of it lies a small hole 
     that will lead to inside the Area 5 Makoro industrial complex.
     Go ahead & proceed in.

   o Battle your way through the corridors of the inner Makoro 
     industrial complex.  Head down to the core area of the complex, 
     similar to the place where you planted the bomb at the Area 1 
     Makoro complex.  Upon reaching there, Cloud will briefly experience
     a flashback which had taken place years ago.

   o After planting the bomb to the core, proceed to head up to the
     control center -- there, Tifa will instruct you to push the 
     botton at the same time as they do, in order for the gate to open.
     (Simply coordinate Cloud's action with Tifa & Barrett as they
      press the button.  It will take a few tries before you get it.)

   o Proceed on to the bridgecross -- you will find yourself 
     surrounded by an army of guards, met by the president of Shinra 
     himself.  Prepare yourself for a battle against the subboss, 
     "Airbuster" robot. 

   o After defeating the subboss "Airbuster" robot, a brief fmv sequence 
     will follow, as Cloud falls to the depths of the city below...

[4.]---[ Area 5 - Encounter with Aerith ]

   o Finding himself with Aerith in a chapel of Area 5 slums, 
     go ahead & talk to Aerith - in the course of the conversation, 
     she will ask you if you still remember her.

[!]  You can respond to her:
        Top Choice -> Tell Aerith you recall meeting her before
     Bottom Choice -> Tell Aerith you do not remember
  
[!]  If you chose the top choice in that you recall meeting her before, 
     another set a choices will be given - you remember her as:
        Top Choice -> She was selling flowers...
     Bottom Choice -> She was drunk on the streets...

     - I hope you chose the top choice - (^o^) -
 
[!]  As the conversation continues, Aerith asks if you do not mind 
     talking to her more...  You can respond:
       
        Top Choice -> You do not mind the conversation
     Bottom Choice -> There is nothing you wish to talk about.

   o Assuming you chose the top choice, she will tell you to wait 
     a minute, as she finishes tending the flowers.  Talk to her
     once more - you both will formally introduce your names to   
     each other - the name screen will appear. 
     (customize Aerith's name to your own preference, or leave as is)
 
     As the Shinra guard walks into the scene, talk to Aerith once 
     more - she will ask if you will become her hired bodyguard, 
     and request that you escort her safely to her house.  As a 
     payment for Cloud's services, Aerith offers to go on a 
     date with Cloud later on.  (^o^)

   o Proceed on up towards the top of the chapel -- a sequence will 
     occur, as Aerith falls from the top ledge before making the leap.
     As the guards begin to close in on Aerith, Cloud quickly notices 
     the few barrels positioned on the beams above him.

[!]  You will be given a choice:
        Top Choice -> Tell Aerith to wait a little while.
     Middle Choice -> Tell Aerith to fight the guards.
     Bottom Choice -> Tell Aerith to run from the guards.

     (I will leave this option up to you -- I do not want to spoil 
      all the fun out of these intense moments from you, ya know.) 

   o After making your escape w/Aerith through the roof of the chapel,
     proceed on to Aerith's house, located to the far northeastern 
     part of the Area 5 slum town.

   o Upon reaching Aerith's house, you will be welcomed by Elmina, 
     Aerith's foster mother.  As Cloud then suggests that he needs
     to go to Area 7 in meeting up with Tifa, Aerith will curiously 
     question of your relationship with Tifa.  

[!]  You can response to Aerith that Tifa is:
        Top Choice -> Not your girlfriend.
     Bottom Choice -> Is your girlfriend.

     (I will leave this choice up to you) 
  
   o Head up to the stairs to rest.  Seeing it that he should not 
     involve Aerith into a dangerous situation, Cloud decides to 
     sneak out & head to Area 7 without her.  
    
     You must sneak out of the house without making any noises or
     Aerith will hear you & you will have to start over. 
     (Hint: Try not to run) 

   o Leave the slum town.  You will find Aerith waiting for you 
     at the entrance to Area 6.

   o As you approach near the entrance to Area 7, Cloud suggests
     that Aerith return to her house.  

[!]  You are given a choice - If Aerith says she does not want to 
     go back, how would you respond:
        Top Choice -> Take her back to her house. 
     Bottom Choice -> Take her with you to Area 7.

     (Although I chose the bottom choice & chose to take her with 
      me to Area 7, I am pretty sure the outcome will be the same 
      in either choice)
 
      As a little sequence is proceeded between Cloud & Aerith at the 
      playground area, a caravan with Tifa approaches the scene & 
      heads off to the slum town nearby.  Follow Aerith to the slum town.

[5.]---[ Area 6 - Inside the Slum Town & Encountering Corneo... ]

    o Explore the slum town - you will find that there are many....
      ...interesting people who inhabit this little slum town.
      
    o First, you will need to head to the "girl bar", located towards
      the lower southeastern end of the slum town, and talk to the 
      towns people there. 

[!]   If you talk to the manager there (the character in the big red
      vest), he will ask you if you are looking for females - 
      you can respond:
         Top Choice -> Ask him if he knows where Tifa is.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell him you have no interest in his business.

      If you chose the top choice, asking him about Tifa's whereabouts, 
      he will tell you that Don Corneo has taken her to his mansion.

    o Now head up to Corneo's mansion, located to the very top end 
      of the slum town.  Talk to the guard standing front.  As you 
      find out that only females are allowed into Corneo's mansion, 
      Aerith suggests that you alter your appearance to disguise as
      a female.
  
    o You must now obtain a dress for Cloud to disguise in.
      Go to the clothing shop - talk to the clerk behind the counter.
      He will tell you unless his father can stop drinking & get to 
      work more, the dress that Cloud seeks will not be completed.
 
    o You must now talk to the father of the clerk - he is in the 
      bar, located right across from the weapon/gun shop.

[!]   Talk to the father - once Aerith convinces him to make a dress
      for Cloud, he will ask you what type of dress you want:
         Top Choice -> A smooth dress
      Bottom Choice -> A silky dress

[!]   You will be given another set of choices:
         Top Choice -> A shiny dress
      Bottom Choice -> A well-blended dress

[Tip!] - Top Choice for 1st + either Top or Bottom for 2nd
         will get you a "cotton dress"
       - Bottom Choice for 1st + Top Choice for 2nd will get 
         you a "satin dress"
       - Bottom Choice for 1st + Bottom Choice for 2nd will get 
         you a "silk dress"

    o Now, leave the bar & head back to the clothes shop.
      The father will be there & will give you the dress.

    o Of course, a dress will not be complete without a wig, right?
      So, after Cloud gets out of the dressing room, you will need to 
      obtain the wig from the wresting arena, located below the 
      weapons/gun shop.

    o Talk to the female - she will offer to give you a wig, only 
      if you can beat her hefty brother in a fitness match.
      After she explains how to operate the buttons for this match,
      she will ask you if you understand:

[!]   You can respond:
         Top Choice -> You do not understand - please explain once more.
      Bottom Choice -> You understand - go ahead with the match.      
  
[Tip!] - Press the [square] button to kneel.
       - Press the [X] button to stand up.
       - Press the [circle] button to bend over & stance.
  
       Basically, the fitness drill here is to kneel, stand-up, & bend
       over again & again until the time has run out.  The best way to 
       beat the hefty brother in this fitness match, is to keep 
       a very steady pace of pressing the buttons in a consistant pattern
       of pressing [square], [x], & [circle] over & over.

    
[!]   Choosing the bottom choice, she will go on to explain that you will
      have 30 secs to beat her brother.  You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Practice first before the match.
      Bottom Choice -> No practice is needed - go on with the real match.

      (I suggest you practice first - the timing of pressing the buttons
       will require some getting used to)

      NOTE: The real match will promptly begin right after the practice.
      
[Tip!] - If you win, you will get a "blond wig"
       - If you tie, you will get a "chapatsu wig"
       - If you lose, you will get a "kusege wig"

[!]   After obtaining the wig, head back to the clothes shop & 
      go to the dressing room.  Aerith will ask you if you are 
      ready to change your clothes - you can respond:
         Top Choice -> You are ready to change your clothes.
      Bottom Choice -> Not ready yet.

    o If you chose to change your clothes, Aerith will change her 
      clothes as well, but note that once you change, you must proceed 
      to Corneo's mansion -- you cannot go back to the "girl bar" or 
      get the coupon from the restaurant...
   
    o Once disguised in your dress & wig, head up to Corneo's mansion.
      Talk to the guard - he will now let you in.  Once inside, 
      go to the dungeon room, where you will encounter Tifa.
     
    o Surprised at your state of appearance, Tifa will go on to explain 
      that Corneo may have some information that will come invaluable
      to them.  Head up to Corneo's office - where, Corneo will 
      choose from the 3 of you to become his...um....woman.
    
[Tip!] - Corneo will choose TIFA if:  You have the cotton dress.
       - Corneo will choose AERITH if:  If you have any of these 3 or 
                                        more of the special items: 
                                          - "silk dress"
                                          - "sexy cologne"
                                          - "blond wig"
                                          - "lingerie"
                                          - "facial make-up"
       - Corneo will choose CLOUD if:  You must have all the special 
                                       items listed above.

    o Once everyone has arrived in Corneo's bedroom, Corneo will 
      confess to the Shinra's next plan in ridding the abaranche 
      of its menacing existance, along with the little slum town 
      surrounding it, through the destruction of the entire Area 7
      of Midgar.

[!]   Just as you are about to leave, Corneo will ask you,
      when should a person expect the worst in a given situation...
      You can respond: 
         Top Choice -> When a person is prepared to die. 
      Middle Choice -> When a person is winning/victorious.
      Bottom Choice -> When a person does not know what is going on.

      (Every choice will get you the same result - go ahead & pick any)

    o A sequence will follow. The president shinra has made his final 
      decision to destroy the entire Area 7 of Midgar, for the sake of 
      ridding the Abaranche....

[6.]---[ Underground Sewers and Abandoned Trains ]
       
    o Prepare yourself for an immediate battle with a subboss "Apusu".
      
    o Tifa suggests that there may still be time left to save Barrett
      and the rest of the Abaranche before the entire Area 7 is 
      literally brought down.  Battle your way through the sewers & 
      through the abandoned train station.  

[7.]---[ Abaranche - Battle to save Area 7 ]
    
    o By the time you reach the entrance to Area 7, Barrett & the 
      Abaranche will already have engaged in battle against the Shinra 
      army at the top of the tower. 

      (Even after that long fall, Wedge seems to still be alive....)
 
    o Battle your way up the tower & meet up with Barrett.
      Along the way up the tower, you will even encounter Vicks & JC 
      injured.  Upon reaching the top of the tower, prepare for 
      a brief battle with Leno - a Shinra operative who will initiate
      the destruction of Area 7.

    o A CG sequence showing the utter destruction of Area 7 will follow.
    
    o As Barrett expresses his rage over the death of his Abaranche 
      resistance - Vicks, Wedge, and JC - Tifa suggests that Barrett's
      daughter, Marin, may still be alive.

[8.]---[ Inside the Shinra Building... ]
    
    o Head off to Aerith's house.  

      (You will find Aerith's foster mother there, who will explain how 
       she encountered Aerith & her real mother some 15 years ago at the 
       train station - her mother whose dying words were for Elmina to 
       take Aerith to a safe place...and so Elmina had realized...she 
       would never see her husband again, nor did she have any children 
       of her own -- and so, there was nothing else for her to do, but 
       to take Aerith home with her...
       Elmina goes on to explain that she somehow knew Aerith was 
       different from others....Aerith retained a certain inner power -
       a power to which had interested the Shinra corp as well for their 
       own corrupt uses.  When Aerith had just brought Marin to her home 
       for safety, the Shinra operatives had taken hold of her -- 
       and Aerith had offered to be taken in exchange for Marin's 
       safe passage.)

      Upon learning of this, Barrett solemnly expresses his apology to 
      Elmina for what Aerith did for Marin.  

      (Barrett goes on to explain his reasoning for leaving Marin behind 
       during the battle -- he wishes to be with Marin more often, but 
       should he be with her, he cannot fight the Shinra corp.  
       And if he does not fight, the planet will die -- and so, he 
       explains how he finds himself in an endless turmoil between being 
       with Marin & saving the planet...)

[!] o Head up the stairs.  Talk to Barrett - he will tell you that
      he will join you to help fight against the Shinra corp to  
      save Aerith at any cost.  Marin will then suggest that Aerith 
      may actually be in love with you (Cloud).  You can repond:
         Top Choice -> Tell Marin you do not know anything about it.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell Marin it would be nice if it were true.

      (I will leave this option up to you)

[!] o Go to the next room over - an option will be given to you 
      if you want to rest or not:
         Top Choice -> Rest.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not rest.

    o Head downstairs & towards the entrance of the house.
      After everyone has gathered back together, Tifa will 
      suggests to go back to the Slum Town (wall market).  Go.

    o Head up towards the northern end of the slum town -- 
      you will encounter a bunch of children running about.
      Follow them - they will lead you to a wall w/a pipe 
      structure up through the middle.  If you talk to the 
      child sitting in front of the pipe, he will tell you that 
      the pipe leads up to the upper levels of Midgar, specifically
      to the Shinra Corp Building.

    o Climb the pipe.  Towards the top of the pipes, you will 
      find a battery outlet, which will open up a passage for you 
      to proceed.  Since you will now need a set of batteries, 
      climb back down to the surface.
  
    o Go to the weapon/gun shop.  Talk to the blacksmith on the 
      left side -- he will offer to sell 3 batteries to you for 300 gil.
      (Choose the top choice to buy)
 
      After buying them, head back up the pipes & use the battery 
      on the outlets.  Proceed on through the various obstacles.
      There will be 3 battery points you will need to cover.
      (Note: Press the [circle] button to jump onto the swinging wire)
      (Note: It may take some time before you correctly position 
             yourself to jump.  Ignore the messages that keep on 
             popping up repeatedly -- they are just instructions 
             on how to jump on to the swinging wire)
 
    o Once you finally get to the Shinra Corp Building, Barrett will 
      explain that Aerith has probably imprisoned in the upper levels
      of the building (60-68th level).   Tifa & Barrett will briefly 
      get into an arguement in how they should approach inside the 
      building.  

      Barrett's Method: Bum Rush through the front door & battle your 
                        way up to the 60th or so floor.
      Tifa's Method: Secretly sneek in through the back stairs, without
                     the suspicion of the guards.

[!]   You will be given a choice.  You can either:
         Top Choice -> Bum Rush in through the front.
      Bottom Choice -> Go in secretly through the back stairs.

      (I will leave this up to you -- however going through the front 
       will probably gain you more experience points & items, although 
       it will be quite a tedious task.)
          
    o Any path you choose to proceed up the building, you will end up 
      at the 59th floor regardless.  Upon reaching the 59th floor, 
      battle against the 3 guards -- one of them will drop a key for the
      60th floor.

    o Proceed on to the tube elevator -- choose the 60th floor.
    o Upon reaching the 60th floor, go to the left control operating 
      room - you will have to coordinate each person to successfully
      cross over to the other side without being caught.  
      Time your movements carefully & accordingly.

[Tip!] - Move only when the guards are crossing & in motion.
         Once Cloud crosses over, you will have to press the [circle]
         button to signal the others when to move.

    o Proceed on up the stairs to the 61st floor.
      You will find yourself in the building's "refresh floor", with 
      several other wandering characters.

[!] o Talk to one of the characters walking around.
      One of them will suspiciously ask what you are doing here -
      You can respond:
         Top Choice -> Ask him where Aerith is held.
      Bottom Choice -> Don't answer him.

      Choose the bottom choice, and he will give you the access key 
      to the 62nd floor.

    o Now head up the stairs once more, up to the 62nd floor.

    o You will notice that the 62nd floor has 4 different colored
      chambers, each containing 3 sets of bookshelves.  
      Go to the room on the western part of the floor, where 
      Domino will offer to give you the keys up to the 65th floor 
      if you can guess the password correctly.  As a bonus, 
      if you can solve his password in the 1st attempt, he will 
      even give you a special materia orb (Zokusei Materia).
      
    o Leave the room & goto any one of the 4 chambers & read a 
      book.  

[Tip!] - Now, normally, you would have to research all the books 
         in all 4 chambers - and using your intuition & cognitive 
         reasoning, you would have to try to come up with a valid 
         guess at the password...
 
         HOWEVER....lucky for you, I will provide the correct answer
         for you (^o^).  The correct answer is "Shichoo Bakuhatsu"
         ....er, at least most of the time....
         Unfortunately, I have found that the answer is not always 
         the same in each game, so you may find the answer to be 
         different in your game...

         (Ok - So this is not much of a tip.....I know, I know) 

    o At any rate, go back to the room & talk to Domino once more 
      to make your final answer selection.  After obtaining the 
      key up to the 65th floor, head back up the stairs & go to 
      the 63rd floor. 
        
    o The 63rd floor is quite optional -- However, it is an opportunity
      to obtain a "Zentaika materia", which will allow you to cast        
      your normal spells onto multiple enemies.  

[Tip!] - The objective of solving the 63rd floor is merely to find 
         the best/shortest route in getting to the coupons, through 
         only opening 3 locked doors.  You can only choose 3 doors 
         to unlock, so use them efficiently.  Once you obtain the 
         coupons, you can exchange them for special items from the 
         computer console.  

         - "A Coupon" will get you the "Pendant of the Stars"
         - "B Coupon" will get you the "Four Slot"
         - "C Coupon" will get you the "Zentaika Materia"

    o Go back up the stairs & head up to the 64th floor.
      Replenish your characters & save your game here.  

    o Go back up the stairs & head up to the 65th floor.
      Upon reaching the 65th floor, you will notice that there 
      are several item/treasure chests located throughout the 
      many rooms -- and you will also notice that most of them
      locked.  

    o There will be 1 chest that is unlocked -- locate it & you 
      will obtain a broken piece of the mini-midgar structure, 
      located in the center circular room.  Go to the circular 
      room & attach the broken piece onto one of the missing 
      sections of the Midgar structure.  You will hear a clicking
      sound -- that is the sound of one of the other chests unlocking.
      Now repeat the procedure until you obtain the key to the 
      66th floor in one of the chests.
  
    o Once obtaining the key, go back up the stairs & head up to 
      the 66th floor.

    o On the 66th floor, go to the toilet.   
      You will discover that you could crawl into the air vents.
      
[!] o You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> The toilet a little dirty - let's flush it first.
      Middle Choice -> Climb on top of toilet.
      Bottom Choice -> Leave the toilet.

    o Choosing the middle choice, proceed on through the air vents 
      and you will be able to witness the Shinra president's meeting
      with his officials.  You will soon learn that President Shinra 
      has no intention of rebuilding Area 7 of Midgar...
  
    o Leave the toilet - you will notice that the scientist Hojou,
      from the meeting, is about to head off as well.  Follow him
      up to the 67th floor.

    o Keep on following him - a sequence will soon follow.

    o Proceed on to the elevator.
      You will finally encounter Aerith, enclosed within the 
      laboratory capsule -- a sequence will follow. 

[!] o Red XIII will join you for your upcoming battle - 
      you will be given a choice to choose who to join in your 
      upcoming battle:
         Top Choice -> Choose Tifa
      Bottom Choice -> Choose Barrett

      Red will then formally introduce himself - the name screen will 
      pop up.  (Customize Red XIII's name to your own preference or 
                leave it as is.)

    o Prepare to battle against the subboss.
     
    o Once everyone has gathered together, the remaining characters 
      will tell you that they will be waiting at the elevators
      on the 66th floor.

[Tip!] - (Make sure not to forget to pick up any materia orbs you 
          may find lying around)

    o The lab assistant/guard will be standing around on the upper
      level of that room -- talk to him.  He will give you the 
      key for access up to the 68th floor.
 
    o Your task here is done - head down to the 66th floor to meet 
      up with everyone at the elevator.

    o Upon reaching there, you will be captured by the Taaks,
      the bounty hunters for the Shinra Corp.
 
    o Finding yourself in the prison cells, talk to everyone. 
      (If you go up to the cell entrance, you will be given 
       options:     Top Choice -> Talk to Barrett
                 Middle Choice -> Talk to Red XII
                 Bottom Choice -> Talk to Aerith)
     
    o Upon resting, a sequence will follow - you will find your    
      cell door unlocked & the guard killed.  Proceed on to 
      the elevator, heading up to the laboratory.
      (where you found Aerith)
 
    o Find the entrance to the stairs & head up to the 69th floor.
      At the 69th floor, it is recommended that you save your 
      game here.
     
    o Head up the stairs to President Shinra's floor -- 
      You will soon learn that Sephiroth was responsible for 
      killing the guards & the president.  

    o Proceed through the door located by the stairs -- 
      you will encounter Rufus - the son of the dead president
      and now the new self-proclaimed president of Shinra.
      As the sequence follows, Cloud will tell Barrett to 
      take everyone else to safety, as prepares to face off against
      Rufus by himself.

    o The control will switch over to Aerith's party --
      Head to the elevator tubes located on the same floor.
      Prepare for an intense battle down the elevator!
  
    o The control will now switch back to Cloud's scene -- 
      (Note: Press the start button to proceed)
      Prepare for a battle against Rufus.

    o After Rufus flees from the battle, proceed back down the stairs
      to meet up with Tifa.  As the events follow, you will be soon
      treated with an extremely well-done CG fmv of the escape scene.

[9.]---[ The Great Escape - Motorcycle Chase ]

    o As one of the mini-games in this epic saga, the objective in 
      this intense moment is to control Cloud w/the motorcycle
      and ward off the Shinra army from attacking your character 
      party's truck.  If the truck takes too many hits, it's gameover.

[Tip!] - How to operate the controls:

      o Use the direction pad to maneuver Cloud in his motorcycle.
      o Press the [square] button to swing your sword to the left.
      o Press the [circle] button to swing your sword to the right.
      o Press the [triangle] button to bring up the main menu screen.
      o Press the [X] button to change your party characters.
      o Press the [start] button to begin your mini-game.

    o Once you reach the end of the road, prepare yourself to 
      battle against a subboss.
 
    o Once escaping from Midgar, everyone will gather in front 
      the main gate - Talk to everyone.  Leave Midgar.
      Barrett will suggest that you head to the town of Kaamu, 
      located not far off from Midgar.  
  
      You will also need to choose which characters to accompany 
      Cloud, as the rest of the remaining characters will meet you 
      at the town of Kaamu.
   
      (NOTE: For detailed information on best operating the controls 
             during the 3d map view, refer to the "Reference Section"
             of this guide.)
 
[10.]---[ The Town of Kaamu ]
     
    o Follow Aerith & Red XIII into the inn - the rest of the characters
      will be waiting for you there.

    o As the conversation follows, Cloud will go on to explain his 
      past relations with Sephiroth...
 
     (...it was because of Sephiroth that had inspired Cloud to 
      initially join the Shinra army...and within time, they had found 
      themselves to become close associates, despite their vast 
      difference in age & experience.  But from friendship to bitter 
      betrayal, Cloud recalls of the very incident that had completely
      altered their association to the worst...5 years ago, when Cloud 
      was but only 16 years of age...)
 
[!] o You will now be controlling Cloud in his own flashback.
      Follow Sephiroth into the inn & talk to him.  
      If you talk to him once more, you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Do not rest yet.
      Bottom Choice -> Rest for the night.

    o Go ahead & rest for the night.
      In the morning, Tifa will accompany Sephiroth & Cloud to 
      the Makoo Energy -- make your way through the mountainous path.
      (Sephiroth will even briefly join you in your battle sequences!
       ...although not playable/controllable though...
       Check out all the spells & abilities he can cast!)
      
      Upon reaching the makoro, follow Sephiroth into the core
      chamber.  You will notice the many capsules interconnected -- 
      Sephiroth will ask you to release the bulb of one of the 
      capsule hatches.  As the events follow, Sephiroth will undergo 
      a state of berzerk rampage, upon learning of his origin as a
      mere creation....a laboratory monster much like those discovered 
      in the capsules...
         
[!] o As the scenery switches back from the flashback to the present 
      time & place, you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Save your game for the time being & rest. 
      Bottom Choice -> Continue on with the story/flashback.

      (I will leave this choice up to you)

    o Resuming with Cloud's story/flashback, head into the mansion.
      You will find a passage leading down to the depths of the 
      corridors below, where you will also find Sephiroth, aimlessly 
      searching for records of the underlining truth & origin of the 
      Jenova Project, his once-presumed "mother".  You soon learn of 
      a scientist by the name "Gasto", who was responsible for the 
      Jenova Project, but also the creation of Sephiroth, whom he 
      did not reveal at the time of his existance...

    o (Cloud now lying on the bed) Head down through the 
      secret passage down to the corridors below, where you will 
      find Sephiroth in a complete state of madness...
   
    o Sephiroth has made his decision to retrieve his "mother" 
      (Jenova) back.   Leave the mansion - you will find that 
      Sephiroth has inflicted his rage against the town & everyone
      in it...

    o Back in the makoro, proceed down to the core chamber room.
      You will encounter Tifa, lying next to her father's dead body, 
      vowing revenge against Sephiroth for what he has done...
      Only to prove her actions useless against Sephiroth, Tifa 
      falls to the cold surface, uttering her last words of Cloud's 
      promise to her that he would come save her when she needed 
      him the most...
  
    o After setting Tifa's body aside (note: Tifa is not dead),
      head up the stairs where Sephiroth went.
      A sequence will follow -- As Cloud vows his revenge against
      Sephiroth for the destruction of his hometown & killing 
      the people.....the flashback ends right before the final 
      blows of fate. (doh!)
  
      The scenery switching back to the present day & time, 
      Cloud will state that he does not remember what had happened
      afterwards.  At this point, many questions arise from the 
      characters -- what happened to Sephiroth afterwards; why are 
      Cloud & Tifa still alive; why was Jenova at the Shinra building;
      and did Sephiroth take Jenova from the building....
  
      (...and now back to the normal routine of the game...)

    o Heading downstairs, talk to Barrett - he will give you a 
      PHS - which will allow you to change/switch your characters
      at the save points or at the 3d map environment.
      (For further details on how to operate the PHS, refer to the 
       "Reference Section")
    
    o Explore the town & purchase new weapons, items, supplies, etc.
      (Make sure to search bookshelves & cupboards for hidden items.)
   
    o Leave the town & head off to the Chocobo farm.
 
[11.]---[ Chocobo Farm ]

[!] o Upon reaching the Chocobo Farm, talk to the chocobo in the very 
      front - you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> "Kue."
      Bottom Choice -> "Kueeeeeee."

      (It would help if we knew how to speak Chocobo) (^o^)

    o At any rate, choose the top choice & the chocobos will dance
      for you!  At the end of the dance, it will also give you 
      the "Chocobo & Mooguri" Summon (Shookan) orb!  

    o Go to the Chocobo stalls/barn & talk to Grin-Grin, who will 
      explain to you how to get Chocobos.  Eventually, he will 
      tell you that you will need a "Chocobo Yose (Attract)" materia 
      that will enable you to encounter chocobos in certain areas.
      He will sell it to you for 2,000 gil.  
 
      (Choose top choice to buy, bottom choice to not buy)
      
[12.]---[ Mithril Mines ]

    o Leave the Chocobo Farm & head to the mithril mines/cave, 
      located right across from the Chocobo Farm.  

[Tip!] - Note:  As you approach the entrance area to the mithril 
                mines/cave, you will notice a large snake shadow 
                crawling around aimlessly.  You can try to quickly
                run across to the cave without being caught, but 
                the chances are very slim.  

       - So, you will need to find a chocobo to ride on, and you 
         will have a much better chance to get across without being 
         caught.  For more details on how to catch a chocobo, refer 
         to the "Reference Section" of this guide. 
      
[Tip!] - If you have the "tekino waza" (enemy's special ability) materia, 
         you can learn the spell "Beta" from the large snake --
         If you can manage to still be alive when the snake casts that
         spell, you will learn the "Beta" spell, which can inflict over
         1000hp damage on the enemies!  Well, for the early to middle 
         portion of the game, this will come in handy.  

    o Upon entering the mithril mines/cave, you will come across a 
      snake corpse on a stick -- one of Sephiroth's artistic work.
      Proceed on and battle your way through the cave.

    o Inside, you will encounter the Taaks, the infamous bounty hunter
      gang/side arm, courtesy of the Shinra Corp.  As their current 
      prime objective is to stop Sephiroth, they will leave the 
      confrontation for another time....

    o Once leaving the cave, you will first notice a structure
      peaking out with a golden condor sitting on top of the egg.
     
[OP!] - If you choose to go to the structure, note that it is an 
        optional event.....for now.  In this optional event, you  
        take a role as a commander in a fleet of an army & position 
        them as you would in any war simulation game.
 
       (For those of you who have played PC titles as "WarCraft" or 
        "Heroes of Might & Magic" will come to appreciate the similar 
        tactics utilized within this mini-event.)     
  
      - For now, I will skip this event & explain how to operate it 
        later on in this guide when it is required to play it in the 
        course of the journeys.

    o Your main objective for now is to get to the town of Junon.
      In order to get to the town of Junon, you will first need to 
      somehow find a way to get across the sea...

[12.]---[ Inside the Shinra Military Naval Base... ]

    o Head off to the naval base - explore the town.
      Go down to the shoreline/beach of the town, using the stairs 
      located towards the lower southwestern end of the town.

    o You will find a little girl, by the name of Puricia, playing 
      by the beach with her dolphin friend.  
  
    o You will suddenly encounter a sea monster -- prepare for a battle.
     
    o Upon defeating the sea monster, Puricia (the little girl) 
      will be unconcious - Cloud will be urged to save her life 
      by CPR - breathing air into her.  

[Tip!] - Here are the controls:

         o Press the [square] button the FIRST time to start collecting
           as much air into your lungs as you can.
         o Press the [square] button the second time to release/stop 
           and breath the air into Puricia.
      
       - Your main objective here is to collect as much air until 
         the "lung" gauge as reach to its near max & at the right
         moment, release the air into her.

[!] o Now go to the house at the very front of the town. 
      Talk to the old lady - she will thank you for saving Puricia, 
      and she will offer to let you rest in the house.
      You can:
         Top Choice -> Rest later.
      Bottom Choice -> Rest now.

      (As there is nothing else to explore for now, I suggest that you  
       rest now & replenish yourselves.)

    o A sequence will follow - questions about the events that happened
      during that incident 5 years ago with Sephiroth fill Cloud's mind, 
      as he continues to wonder why he cannot seem to remember where
      Tifa was before he the incident took place and why he never 
      spent time alone together with Tifa...

    o Upon waking up, go find Puricia (the little girl).
      She will give you the "Shiva" summoning materia orb!
      As Cloud questions what the noise & excitement above is all about,
      Puricia will explain that preparations for the celebration 
      festivities are taking place in honor of the new president of 
      Shinra - Rufus.  

    o In getting up to the upper levels of the naval base, Puricia will 
      help you -- follow her down to the beach.  She will explain to 
      you that every time you blow the whistle, the dolphin will 
      leap you up to the beams above.

[!]   You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Tell Puricia to explain the procedure once more.
      Middle Choice -> You are ready to try.
      Bottom Choice -> You are not ready - you will try later.

[Tip!] - How to operate the controls:
     
         o Press the [square] button to blow the whistle & call the 
           dolphin - the dolphin will leap you up into the air.

       - The objective here is to try to position yourself at a
         fair distance from the beam above & blow the whistle 
         so that you will land just on top of the beam.

    o Once you have reached the beam, proceed up to the airbase.
      
    o Make your way to the guard locker room, where the head guard 
      will mistake you for a participant guard in the festivities'
      army parade.

[!] o Once in the locker room, he will tell you to change your 
      clothes.  Look in one of the lockers - you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Do not change your clothes.
      Bottom Choice -> Change your clothes.

    o Assuming you chose to change your clothes, your task now is to
      follow the other guards off into the parade & blending in 
      the parade march with as little mistake as possible.
       
      NOTE: As the parade is being televised, you will want to blend in 
            the parade march quickly & swiftly -- the % value in the 
            corner of the screen represents the current tv ratings that 
            are received from the station.  
  
[Tip!] - The higher the ratings you finish with, the better item you 
         will receive.

    o OK - once back in the locker room, the next task is to learn the 
      rifle performance procedures. (This one is a killer) (^o^)
         
[Tip!] - The objective here is to perform the rifle drill at the 
         festivities as well coordinated with the other guards as 
         possible.  You must press 1 button at a time during each laps 
         of movement.  The head guard will briefly announce which 
         button to press -- act quickly or you will completely stand 
         out & appear out of order.

         So.....here is an example:

         o Press [circle] button first.
         o Press [trigle] button next.
         o Press [square] button next.
         o Press [X] button next.
         o Press Left on the directional pad.
         o Press Right on the directional pad.
      
         NOTE:  This is just an example.  
                During the real performance, the buttons are completely 
                random, so you will have to quickly respond to the 
                messages that pop up.  
            
         And.....each of these buttons must be pressed to react  
         accordingly to the other guards, so that everyone 
         appears to move simultaneously.

         And.....much like the previous task, depending on how well 
         you perform will determine what special item you will get.
         The better the performance, the better the item.  Got it?
       
         (Good Luck - you will need it)

[13.]---[ Sailing Across the Sea... ]
      
    o Aboard the sea ship/boat, explore & talk to the crew & guards.
      You will find that the rest of your character party are aboard 
      the ship & disguised as Shinra guards as well.

      (You will even find Red XIII trying to stand upright as a 
       human Shinra guard as well!) (^o^)

    o Once you find Barrett carefully watching Rufus & Hidekkar, 
      talk to him.  An alarm will suddenly sound off -- Someone 
      has been discovered....but whom?  (Sephiroth?!) 
 
    o Upon gathering back together with your character party, 
      you will have to choose who to join you on your battle 
      sequences.

    o Head down to the lower deck of the ship - proceeding through 
      the door, you will encounter....Sephiroth.
      The only words you hear him speak are - "time.....has fallen..."
      Prepare for a battle against a subboss.
   
      (Make sure to pick up the "Iifrit" materia orb & the items before
       you leave the room)

    o Upon reaching the shoreline, you will arrive in the town/beach
      resort of Costa del Sol. 
   
[14.]---[ Beach Resort of Costa Del Sol ]
    
    o Explore the town, meet the women, buy some items, meet the women, 
      rest & replenish your characters, meet the women, talk to the 
      people, meet the women.............and meet more women! (^o^)
  
    o Head to the beach of the resort - you will encounter a familiar
      face...a person you met back from the Shinra Building...

[!]   You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> That is Hojou....
      Bottom Choice -> Those girls in bathing suits....

[!] o Talk to the girls who are sitting next to him.
      You will be given choices to respond to the girls:
         Top Choice -> Tell them you have business with Hojou to deal with
      Bottom Choice -> Ask if that is Hojou 
  
      You will soon learn that Hojou is there for the very same reason 
      you are -- finding Sephiroth.
 
    o Leave the beach resort & head off to the Corel Mountain range.

[15.]---[ Corel Mountain Range ]

    o Follow the path located towards the mountainous range from 
      the beach resort - there will be a cave leading inside the 
      Corel Mountain Range.

    o Battle your way through - upon crossing the train tracks, 
      high above the ground, be aware that there will be 3 sections
      of the train tracks that are HIGHLY unstable & you will fall 
      through the tracks.  Before you fall down, a message will pop up, 
      urging you to press the [circle] button to jump before the 
      unstable track falls.

[Tip!] - HOWEVER, falling through the tracks is not such a bad idea 
         as it may sound - you may even end up finding some invaluable 
         items...

         - First: Allow yourself to fall (meaning, do not press any 
                                          button)
         - Second: As you are falling, instructions will pop up on 
                   the screen.  Note that you will only have a brief
                   amount of time to react.  The controls are:

                   o While holding down on the directional pad 
                     (either to the right or left), keep on rapidly 
                     tapping the [circle] button.  As you flap your 
                     arms, you will slowly swiver over to the 
                     direction you are trying to go towards.

         - Third: If you have managed to fall over to the far right or 
                  left, you can pick up a special artifact or two.
                  
         - The items you can get are: - "The Pendant of the Stars"
                                      - "Wizard's Rod" (for Aerith)

    o Proceed on past the train tracks - you will encounter/notice 
      the rest of your characters on the lower train tracks.  
      As you will need to lower the bridge for them, head over to 
      the control switch, which is located by simply following the 
      path of the upper level train track.   

    o Head on past the main bridge - you will then reach the rural 
      town of North Corel.

[16.]---[ Town of North Corel ]
         
    o Upon arriving in the town of North Corel, a brief sequence will 
      follow.  You will soon come to notice the bitter hatred & despise 
      the people of North Corel have against Barrett.  Apparently, 
      Barrett was accused & held responsible for what is now this 
      shattered town of utter filth & lost hope...
 
    o Explore the town & purchase the supplies as needed.
      (Don't expect to receive any friendly advise from any of the 
       people here.)

    o Head towards the trailer station located to the left of the 
      town.  Barrett's flashback sequence will follow.

     (...Barrett recalls of the very incident that had occured just 
      4 years ago, in which it all started out as a solution for the 
      replacement of coal energy with this new source that had 
      interested them so - "Makoo Energy", courtesy of the Shinra Corp...  

      ...and despite the protest of Dayin, the only one who saw this 
      "solution" as betraying what their ancestors had once so struggled 
      to establish in Corel, Barrett & the others blindly allowed the 
      Shinra Corp. to proceed with the Makoro, not even realizing the 
      consequences to be faced shortly after... 

      ...there was an accident at the Makoro complex, resulting in its 
      untimely destruction.  You soon learn that the Shinra corp. 
      had accused the people of Corel for intentionally causing the 
      accident, and thus the Shinra army proceeded executing the 
      people & left their once humble town in utter ruins...)

      (and so the flashback ends....)

      Barrett blames himself for allowing to be so easily deceived 
      and taken in by the dreams hoped for with the Makoo energy.
     
[!] o The trailor station operator will interrupt and urge you 
      whether or not you wish to board the trailer.
      You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Ride the trailor to the Gold Saucer.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not ride.

    o Go ahead & ride the trailor.  You will be treated with a 
      well rendered CG fmv - simply amazing detail. (^o^)

[17.]---[ Inside the Gold Saucer ]

    o Upon arriving at the entrance of the Gold Saucer, talk to the 
      ticker operator at the front of the entrance. 
      He will explain to you that:
        
      - 3000 gil will get you an admittion ticket for the entire stay.
      - 30,000 gil will get you an unlimited gold pass that you can 
        use to come back to the Gold Saucer any time forever.

[!] - You will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Pay 3000 gil.
      Middle Choice -> Pay 30,000 gil.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not pay.

      (If you have the 30,000 gil to spare, it is up to you.
       Either way, you will have to get inside to proceed on.)

[Tip!] - The ticket operator will then explain that in Gold Saucer land, 
         they have their own type of currency known as "GP".  GPs are
         used for admission in the various rides, events, etc.  
         You can obtain GPs at 2 specific locations in Gold Saucer:
           
              o Wonder Square: An amusement arcadia center, where you 
                               can play various video/interactive games
                               to obtain GPs.  
              o Chocobo Square: A Chocobo racing gambling outlet, where
                                you can place bets on the races to gain 
                                GPs, depending on your luck in winning.
                                You can also gain GPs here by entering 
                                your own Chocobo in the races as well, 
                                but this will come later in your quest...

[Tip!] - You will also notice that there is a save-point flag just by 
         the entrance to the Gold Saucer.  HOWEVER, in order to use 
         that flag to access any of the save or menu commands, you
         need to shell out * 5 GP *!!.  So, what this means is that 
         you will first need to go inside, win those GPs, and come 
         back out to save - (pretty devious, no?) (^o^)
             
         [!] -  Once you have the 5 GPs, you will be given a choice:
                   Top Choice -> Do not pay the 5 GPs.
                Bottom Choice -> Might as well pay the 5 GPs...

    o Upon entering the main "station", Aerith will be trying to cheer 
      up Barrett from his current state of emotional anguish.
      (But only to succeed in irritating him even more...)

    o Now, select a character to accompany you.
      Head into the Wonder Square - you will encounter Cait Sith!
     (The name screen will pop up - customize Cait Sith's name to your 
      own preference, or leave as is.)
    
      For a brief while, Cait Sith will be performing fortune telling - 
      he will be trying to guess Sephiroth's current whereabouts...
      ...but is not convincing, as Cloud is not impressed by the 
      awkward answers he gets back.  Cait Sith will then join your party.

    o Head towards the Battle Square area - you will discover several 
      dead Shinra guards lying around.....could Sephiroth have done this?!
      As Cloud examines the bodies, you soon learn from the survivor 
      that a "man with his left arm replaced with a gun" went on a berzerk 
      rampage & had killed everyone......could it have been Barrett??!!
    
      A sequence will take place - as Cloud is mistakenly accused for  
      this very incident, Dio (head of operations at Gold Saucer) will 
      sentence you to the depths of the Corel Prison as punishment.

[18.]---[ Corel Prison ]

    o Upon arriving there, you will find Barrett there.
      Barrett will urge you not to follow him & leave him alone - he will 
      tell you that there is something that only he must face alone & 
      deal with...
 
    o Explore around the prison camp - you will notice that there are 
      many.......interesting people here that just enjoy following you 
      around.  
   
    o Go to the house located right below the save-point flag.
      A sequence will follow - as everyone gathers back together, 
      you will soon learn that the "man with his left arm replaced 
      with a gun" who killed the Shinra guards was NOT Barrett.
      As the conversation follows, Barrett will explain what had 
      happened after the tragic incident had occured 4 years ago 
      at Corel...

     (...Barrett & Dayin were the only ones not present at the time
      when the tragic incident had fallen upon Corel.  By the time 
      they had learned of this, some of the Shinra guards had surrounded
      them, firing at them on the spot.  Within moments after, they 
      had found themselves literally holding on to each other for 
      their very lives, only to be separated by the bullet shots that 
      had torn their arms apart - that was the last time Barrett had 
      seen Dayin alive.....As a result, Barrett's right arm was surgically 
      altered into the arsenal you have come to rely upon.  It was then 
      that he also learned that another man had undergone a similar 
      surgery in having his left arm replaced with a gun......Dayin.
      And now, Barrett (in the present time) feels obligated to 
      apologize to Dayin for what had happened...)

    o As the character selection screen will shortly pop up, Barrett 
      will now be in your battle party - choose another character or 
      leave as is.  

[!] o Go to the trailer mobile where the 2 guards are standing out in
      front. Talk to Koutsu (in the green suit) - he will ask you if
      you want to leave the Corel Prison:
         Top Choice -> Tell Koutsu that you are not interested.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell Koutsu that you want to leave the prison.

    o Choose the bottom choice - he will tell you that the only way 
      you can leave the Corel Prison is if you enter & win in a chocobo 
      race.

    o Leave the trailer mobile & head back out to the entrance of the
      Corel Prison camp, where you first entered from.  You will notice 
      that the inmate who was guarding the outer gate has been shot dead.
      Proceed through the gate.  

      (Note: Try not to wander off to far into the desert, or you will 
             find yourself wandering aimlessly...)

    o Upon reaching an automobile junk yard, you will encounter Dayin.
      A sequence will follow -- In a state of hopeless despair,
      Dayin speaks of the anguish he has endured for so long....the 
      destruction of Corel...the death of Elenoa (his wife)....and most 
      importantly, Marin.....his daughter...

      (Yes, you learn that Dayin is Marin's true biological father - 
       when Dayin had fallen during the incident 4 years ago, he was 
       assumed to have perished, thus Barrett since then had taken 
       care of Marin as his own...)

      Upon learning of Marin being alive, Dayin replies to Barrett that 
      now there is no other choice but to fight him to the finish -- 
      he states that Elenoa (his wife) is probably in sorrow for being 
      all alone in the afterlife and that he must soon take Marin to her...
      (meaning that he will even go to extent of killing his own daughter)
      
    o Prepare to battle against Dayin with only Barrett.

     (Upon defeating him, Dayin will ask you to give his wife's 
      pendant to Marin & take good care of her.  After his final words, 
      Dayin leaps to his bitter end...)

    o Back at the trailer mobile, Koutsu, seeing the pendant that 
      Dayin had so preciously kept with him, will allow you to enter 
      the chocobo race - Cloud will be chosen to ride the chocobo.
      The young girl, Esto, will enter the scene - she will be your 
      manager for the chocobo race.

[!]   In the elevator, Esto will ask you if you need instructions 
      in riding the chocobo in the race.
      You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Yes, ask for the instructions.
      Bottom Choice -> No, you do not need any instructions.

[Tip!] - Here are controls to operate:

         o Use the directional pad to maneuver/control the chocobo.
         o Press [select] to switch between automatic & manual control, 
           as you ride the chocobo.
         o Press [square] button to Speedup.
         o Press [X] button to Slowdown.
         o Press [circle] button to whip the chocobo, which will give
           you a burst of speed temporarily.  However, this will also 
           decrease your chocobo's stamina level even more.

         o Keep an eye on your stamina gauge - If your chocobo is 
           continuously speeding up, its stamina will decrease rapidly.
           Once the stamina gauge has depleated, your chocobo will 
           temporarily rest in order to regain its strength.  So, 
           be sure to slow down at certain points of the race to give 
           your chocobo some energy to last.

         o Pressing the [start] button will allow you to forfeit the 
           current race & engage in another race immediately.
         
         o Note that the default control setting is on AUTOMATIC.
           So, if you notice your chocobo is starting to depleat on 
           its stamina level, switch to MANUAL controls & you can 
           slow down to regain some strength.

[19.]---[ Back in Gold Saucer ]

[!] o Upon arriving back in Gold Saucer, talk to the other racers.
      The race will begin shortly.  Head towards the exit of the 
      room - Esto will enter the scene once more, asking you if you 
      need to hear the instructions for the controls once more.
      You will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Ask Esto to explain the controls once more.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not explain the instructions any more.

     (Also, make sure not to forget to pick up the Ramuh Summoning 
      Materia orb that is lying around in the room)

    o Go & prepare yourself to race!
   
     (If you lose the first time, Esto will find you a faster chocobo 
      to ride.  Since I have never been able to win the 1st race, I am 
      not sure if there is a bonus prize for winning the first time 
      around though...) 
          
    o Upon winning the race, you will soon learn that your character 
      party has been released from the Corel Prison, and Dio has
      even offered you a Buggie Mobile, which will allow you to travel 
      through the desert & even over rivers!  It also comes to your 
      attention that Sephiroth has been seen heading across the river, 
      towards the Gongaga Area...
   
    o The character selection screen will pop up - go ahead & change 
      your character preferences or leave as is.

[20.]---[ Gongaga Area ]

    o Your task here in Gold Saucer is done....for now.
      Riding the Buggie Mobile, cross the river & head towards the 
      Gongaga Area.

    o Upon arriving in the Gongaga Area, you will encounter the 
      Taaks (remember them?).  Prepare to battle against the Taaks.
   
    o Follow the various paths/trails - one of the trails leads to a 
      small rural village.  Another will lead to a destroyed Makoro 
      site, where a sequence will follow.

      In the sequence at the destroyed makoro site, Scarlet (one of the 
      head officials of Shinra corp) will enter the scene, only to pity
      the worthlessness of the mako materia energy of this site - she 
      will even briefly speak of the "Large" & "Huge" Materia orbs 
      that will power a weapon of unimaginable destructive potential...
      
    o After the helicopter leaves the scene, be sure to pick up the 
      "worthless" materia that Scarlet did not even bother to pick up.
      It is the "Titan" Summoning Materia orb, one of more graphically 
      impressive summoning spells in the game (IMO of course).

    o Leave the area - head to the small rural village, if you have not 
      already done so.  There, go to the little hut located on the 
      lower right of the village - a little sequence will follow.
      
      In the sequence, the old folks will speak of their child, Zacks, 
      whom they have not seen or heard from since 10 years ago...
      Although Tifa will deny knowing a person by the name "Zacks", 
      her physical response suspiciously may tell otherwise...
   
[!] o Leave the hut & talk to Tifa.
      In the course of the conversation, she will oddly complement Cloud 
      for accomplishing his dreams of becoming a "Soldier"...
      You can respond to Tifa:
         Top Choice -> Tell her you were only lucky.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell her it was only because you struggled hard 
                       to become a "Soldier"

      (Tifa is seemingly holding something back....)

    o Your task here is done - leave the Gongaga area.
      Head off to the Cosmo Cannon, Red XIII's home.  It is located 
      towards the mountainous cannon range, crossing the river from the 
      Gongaga area.  You will find that the path within the mountainous 
      cannon range is rather twisty & curvy.  

[21.]---[ Cosmo Canyon ]
 
    o Upon arriving in the town of Cosmo Canyon, you will first notice 
      that Red XIII is recognized by the name, "Nanaki"...
 
[!]   Anyhow, talk to the person standing in front of the entrance.
      He will ask you if you have ever heard of their town, Cosmo Canyon, 
      before.  You can respond:
         Top Choice -> Yes, you are familiar with the town of Cosmo Canyon.
      Bottom Choice -> No, you have not heard of this town before.

    o Choose the bottom choice - The person at the entrance will know 
      that you are lying if you choose the top choice.
      He will then let you in, at the request of Red XIII or Nanaki.
       
    o Explore the town.  Talk to Red XIII - he will briefly explain the 
      significance of his town & how he is the last of his kind.
 
     (You soon learn that his mother died shortly after his birth, and 
      as far as Red XIII is concerned, his father had abandoned him at 
      birth...and so he will tell you that his journey with you has come 
      to an end, as he will need to stay & guard his home.) 
      
    o Follow Red XIII & the other characters inside.  Rest & replenish
      your characters as needed.  Proceed through & go to where Red XIII
      is.  You will meet Boogen-Haagen, who is both grandfather & mentor 
      to Red XIII (or Nanaki, as he referred to here).  

      A sequence will follow - Boogen-Haagen will shortly begin to 
      explain the course of deterioration the planet is gradually
      undergoing, as Cloud listens to its wails of agony & pain...
      Boogen-Haagen will then urge Cloud to bring the other characters 
      to him as well, as he has something interesting to reveal to you.

    o Head down to the lower levels & gather your characters back into 
      your venturing party.  Upon doing so, head back up to 
      Boogen-Haagen's quarters.
      
    o Talk to Boogen-Haagen.  A sequence will take place - it is revealed 
      to Cloud the foundation & survival of the planets and the origin 
      of its energy known as the "lifestream" - the very essence of their 
      existance...their creation and destruction...

    o Leave the room - head outside to the bonfire, where everyone 
      in your character party will gather back together.
      Talk to everyone. 
  
    o Red XIII (Nanaki) begins to share his bitter remorse against his 
      father, whom he believed for so long had disgracefully abandoned 
      his mother & the people of Cosmo Canyon.
      Upon hearing of this, Boogen-Haagen tells Red XIII that there
      is something he wishes to show him....He will also tell Cloud to 
      choose another character to accompany you as well, as the journey
      inside will not be a safe one....

[!] o After choosing your characters, proceed to follow Boogen-Haagen 
      inside.  Talk to him -- he will ask you if you are ready:
         Top Choice -> Tell him you are prepared...
      Bottom Choice -> Tell him to wait - you are not ready to go yet

[22.]---[ Cosmo Canyon - Journey Within.. ]
    
    o Head down to the very depths of the caves within.
      Battle your way through.  Prepare to battle a subboss towards 
      the end of the caves.  

    o Upon defeating the subboss, you will shortly discover what 
      Boogen-Haagen was meaning to show Red XIII...

      The "senshi" (warrior) who stood there to the bitter end, 
      sacrificing his own life in guarding the entrance, fighting the 
      "Gizoku" to protect his village & people of the Cosmo Canyon....
      ...there, stood the "senshi" (warrior) known as Seto, the father of 
      Red XIII (Nanaki)...
   
    o Back at the bonfire, Cloud will decide it is time to depart.
      After choosing your character preferences, head towards the 
      entrance of the Cosmo Canyon - Red XIII (Nanaki) will rejoin 
      your character party.  Your task here is done. 
      Leave the Cosmo Canyon.    
  
[OP!]---[ Find & Recruit YUFFIE!!! ]

EDITOR'S NOTE:  OK.....Although this is a completely optional event,  
                I will now go into details on finding & recruiting Yuffie 
                into your character party.  For those of you who already 
                know or already have found Yuffie, you can skip this 
                little section.

              o In finding Yuffie, cross the river where you came from 
                before the Cosmo Canyon, and wander around aimlessly
                within the forest area, preferably nearby the river. 
                It is also possible that you may encounter her in other
                forest areas throughout the lands as well...                

[Tip!] - Encountering Yuffie is completely random - however note that 
         if your character's "luck" stats are higher, you will have a 
         higher chance of encountering her more frequently & quickly.
         
              o Upon encountering her, prepare to battle against her.
                She should not pose as much of a threat to you - 
                a few summoning spells should suffice.
 
              o Upon defeating her, the scenery will change, as you will
                find her lying on the ground.  

              o--> NOTE: You will also notice a save-point flag nearby.
                         Do NOT attempt to use it, as it is a trap/decoy
                         that will allow Yuffie to escape!
  
[Tip!] - In getting Yuffie to successfully join your character party, 
         you will have to answer a series of questions all correctly.  
         Choose any wrong responses & she will run away!
         However, lucky for you, just follow the answers provided below, 
         and you will have Yuffie in your char. party in no time! (^o^)

   [!] - Q.#1 o Once talking to her, Yuffie will first urge you to
                fight her once more in a rematch.
                   Top Choice -> You will give her the rematch.
                Bottom Choice -> Ignore her.

                (Answer #1: Bottom Choice)

   [!] - Q.#2 o As Yuffie will pester you to give her that rematch, 
                talk to her once more.  She will boast that you are 
                overwhelmed by her "superior strength".  You can respond:
                   Top Choice -> "....um...well...Yes" 
                Bottom Choice -> Tell Yuffie she will lose no matter 
                                 how many times she fights.

                (Answer #2: Top Choice)

   [!] - Q.#3 o As she begins to boast even more about her "superior 
                strength", she bids you farewell.....only to stop 
                to tell you that she is REALLY about to leave now.  Really.
                You can respond:
                   Top Choice -> Tell her to go about on her way.
                Bottom Choice -> Tell her to wait for a while.

                (Answer #3: Bottom Choice)
 
   [!] - Q.#4 o Yuffie will boastfully presume that you have been 
                so impressed by the sheer magnitude of her strength
                that you desperately need her help in your quest.
                   Top Choice -> "....um...well...Yes"
                Bottom Choice -> Tell her she is ridiculously mistaken.

                (Answer #4: Top Choice)

   [!] - Q.#5 o As Yuffie ponders whether or not to join your party, 
                she will eventually come to decide in joining you.
                You can respond:
                   Top Choice -> Ask for her name.
                Bottom Choice -> Proceed to leave the area, without 
                                 asking for her name.

                (Answer #5: Bottom Choice)

              o And....so after correctly responding to Yuffie, 
                the name screen will pop up shortly.  Customize her name
                to your own preference or leave as is.
                
              o You now officially have Yuffie in your character party!

(And now, back to the normal routine of game....)

    o Proceed on past the Cosmo Canyons & the mountainous range, 
      to the town across the river -- Cloud & Tifa's hometown...
      
[23.]---[ Niburuhelm - Cloud & Tifa's Hometown ]

    o Upon arriving in Niburuhelm, there will be a brief conversational 
      scene, as the characters stand there utterly confused & dismayed 
      from what they are seeing -- the town of Niburuhelm, the houses
      and surroundings, all seemingly intact & unscathed.....when in fact
      Cloud clearly recalls of the destruction & devastation to which 
      Sephiroth had bestowed upon this very town 5 years ago..... 
   
    o Explore & search the town - you will encounter several black-caped
      odd beings swivering aimlessly in the rooms throughout the houses. 
      Talk to them - most of them will even give you a special item.
     
     (They will be mumbling about a "reunion" and about Sephiroth 
      calling them to return...)

[^o^] - If you go to the 2nd floor in Tifa's house, you will find a 
        piano there - you will even be able to play it!  
        (Choose the bottom choice for both questions)
     
               o Use directional key pad to play the chords.
               o Use the four main buttons to play the first 4 keys.
               o While holding down either the L1 or R1 button, 
                 use the four main buttons to play the last 4 keys.
 
    o Head towards the mansion, located towards the upper end of the 
      town.

[24.]---[ Inside the Mansion... ]

    o Battle your way through - you will find a particular room with 
      a safe.  Search it - Cloud apparently will sense something....evil...
 
[OP!] - (NOTE: This is an optional event - it is NOT required to open the 
               safe, in order to proceed on through the game.  You can 
               come back to this whenever you prefer to.)
 
[!] - If you choose to search the safe, you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Try to open the safe regardless.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not try to open the sage.

[Tip!] - Once you choose to open the safe, you will have exactly 20 seconds
         to enter in a passcode....or else.  
    
         Here is the passcode:  o Turn right to "36"
                                o Turn left to "10" 
                                o Turn right to "59"
                                o Turn right to "97"

       o--> NOTE: When turning the number dial of the safe, make sure NOT 
                  to exceed past the number you are trying to stop at, or 
                  the safe will not unlock.  For example, if you are
                  turning the number dial over to "36", you MUST not 
                  accidently go beyond that number to "37+", or the code
                  will not work at all.

       o--> NOTE: When proceeding to turn the number dial from "right 36" 
                  to "left 10" to "right 59" and to "right 97", note that
                  you must NOT return back to the "0" point each time.
                  Simply turn DIRECTLY to each number accordingly.

    o Upon entering the correct passcode, as instructed above, 
      prepare to battle against a surprise subboss!

    o After defeating the subboss, pick up the key inside - you will 
      need it to unlock a certain door.... 
     (Make sure to pick up the "Odin" summoning materia as well, which 
      is lying around nearby the safe.)

    o Go to the hidden passage & head down to the depths of the stairs
      below...

[OP!]---[ Find & Recruit VINCENT!!! ]

EDITOR'S NOTE:  OK.....Although this is a completely optional event,  
                I will now go into details on finding & recruiting Vincent 
                into your character party.  For those of you who already 
                know or plan on recruiting Vincent later on in the game, 
                you can skip this little section.

           o--> NOTE: In order to get to Vincent, you must have the 
                      key, which is obtained from the safe.  If you 
                      have not already done so, you cannot unlock the 
                      door leading to Vincent.
 
           o Vincent is in the room with the coffins, located just 
             right before entering the library room.  Search the 
             center coffin - Vincent will awaken...

       [!] o In the course of the conversation, Vincent will question 
             Cloud of his knowledge pertaining to Sephiroth.
             You will be given a choice:
                Top Choice -> Do not say anything.
             Bottom Choice -> Explain to Vincent of your quest regarding
                              with Sephiroth...
    
            (Choose the bottom choice)
             After Cloud explains his situation with Sephiroth, 
             Vincent will return to his coffin, stating that there lies 
             a personal affliction he must first deal with...
             
       [!] o Talk to him once more - you will be given a choice:
                Top Choice -> Tell him, "Good night"
             Bottom Choice -> Ask Vincent who he is & his situation.
             
            (Choose the bottom choice)
            (The name screen will soon pop up - customize Vincent's 
             name to your own preference or leave as is.)

             Vincent was once a member of the Taaks, however with no 
             affiliation with the Shinra Corp.  You soon learn of a
             a woman by the name of Lukulecia, Gasto's assistant during
             the Jenova Project, who had given birth to Sephiroth...
             He then goes on to explain the unfortunate fate he had 
             accidently bestowed upon Lukulecia, whom he had deeply 
             fallen in love with...
 
           o As Vincent has nothing more to tell you,leave the coffin room.
             Head back towards the entrance of the cave - Vincent will 
             unexpectedly join you, for reaons in finding Hojou...

(And now, back to the normal routine of game....)
 
    o Proceed on to the library room - you will encounter Sephiroth -
      It is here that you first hear Sephiroth mention the falling comet...
      He will tell you to follow him to the Niburuhelm Mountains.
      
      (Make sure to pick up that materia orb that Sephiroth threw at you) 

    o Leave the mansion & proceed through the other exit, located 
      near the mansion.  Head towards the Niburuhelm Mountains.

[25.]---[ Niburuhelm Mountains - The Cavern Within ]

    o Battle your way through the mountainous range & paths.
    
    o Upon crossing the bridge & entering the cavern, there will be 
      a subboss awaiting your arrival towards the lower level of the 
      cavern.  Prepare to battle against the subboss.

      NOTE: Make sure to use the ladders to climb down to the lower level
            of the cavern, or you will not be able to get back up to 
            experiment with the various pipes.  If you unknowingly already
            slid down the pipes & still want to get back up, you will have 
            to take a longer route, through the left passage below.
      
[Tip!] - You will notice the various pipes interconnected throughout
         certain regions of the cavern.  While most of them will lead 
         you to the lower level of the cavern, there are some that will 
         lead you to regions of the cavern w/special items to pick up...

    o Upon defeating the subboss, head out the cavern to the outside.
      You must now go to the Rocket Town.

[26.]---[ The Rocket Town ]

    o After noticing the tilted rocket that seemingly has been rusting 
      away for the past several years, explore the little rocket town.
      
    o Head over to the house located within the upper area of the town. 
      Go through the back entrance of the house, where you will discover
      a plane (codename: "tiny bronco") - a brief sequence will follow.
 
      You will shortly encounter Shiela, who will tell you to talk to 
      the project organizer of the Rocket town, if you wish to borrow 
      the plane.  As the conversation follows, you soon learn that 
      the new Shinra president, Rufus, is due to arrive in the Rocket
      town shortly...

    o Head towards the rocket site.  You will encounter the project 
      organizer of the Rocket town - Cid!  
 
     (The name screen will pop up - customize Cid's name to your own 
      preference or leave as is.)

[!] o Upon introducing himself, Cid will ask for your reason being here.
      You can respond:
         Top Choice -> Ask Cid about the situation with the rocket.
      Middle Choice -> Ask Cid about Rufus coming to the Rocket town soon.
      Bottom Choice -> Ask Cid if you can borrow his plane ("tiny bronco").
       
     (If you chose the top choice (about the rocket), Cid will go on to 
      explain how the rocket was once a highly anticipated research & 
      development project initiated by the Shinra corp, back during the 
      "Great Wars" before the discovery of the makoo energy.  You soon 
      learn that on the very day of the rocket launch initiation, 
      Shiela, who was Cid's assistant at the time, somehow caused the
      entire project to collaspe....and within time, the Shinra Corp.
      ceased to support funding the project, upon the discovery of 
      the makoo energy....and so shortly enough, the people's interest in 
      the rocket project faded away -- and Cid's dreams of flying & 
      exploring the vast new worlds & galaxies in space were left 
      unfulfilled...)  

     (If you chose the middle choice (about Rufus), he will excitedly
      state that Rufus is in fact coming shortly, feeling reassured that 
      a person as young as Rufus would better understand Cid's dreams 
      of reestablishing his rocket project & exploring the galaxies...)

     (If you chose the bottom choice (about borrowing the plane), he will
      ridicule you for asking such a stupid question - the plane is one
      his prized possessions.)

    o Now head back to the Cid's house (where you discovered the plane).
      You will encounter Shiela once more - Upon Cid's return, a brief
      sequence will take place, as Shiela will explain to you what had 
      happened during the very day of the rocket launch that had 
      shattered Cid's dreams of navigating the stars...
  
     (As Shiela recalls of the very incident, you soon learn how she was 
      so concerned with the functionality & success of the mission to 
      launch without any failures, that she was willing to sacrifice her 
      own life...for the mission...and for Cid's dreams...

      As the final countdown of the launch had initiated, Cid had found 
      himself caught in a turmoil between his dreams of becoming the 
      first to navigate the stars and the value of saving a human life...   
      ...Shiela's life...)

    o Leave the house - Rufus has finally arrived.
      As you will soon learn that Rufus has come to borrow Cid's plane
      for their purposes in finding Sephiroth, Shiela will urge you 
      to talk to Palma (the fat Shinra head operative), who is outside 
      by the plane.

    o Go through the back door to the plane - talk to Palma.
      Prepare to engage in one of the most hilarious battles yet. (^o^)
      A CG fmv sequence will follow.  Cid will then after officially 
      join your party.

    o Now that you have acquired Cid's plane, you can explore through the 
      vast shores of the lands at your disposal.

[OP!] HOWEVER, before continuing on with the normal routine of your 
  |   saga, I will now sidetrack to an optional event which will take 
  |   place in Yuffie's hometown -- so, what this means is that you will
  |   need to have found Yuffie already.  If you have not found Yuffie 
  |   yet or plan to recruit her later in the game, you can skip over
  |   this optional event section & come back to it later.
  |
[OP!]---[ Town of Uutai - In Yuffie's Hometown ]
       
    o Head towards the island located to the very left on the world map.
      It is the island where Yuffie's hometown is located. 

      (NOTE: Press the [select] button in the 3d environment mode
             to enlarge the world map or to disable it.)

    o Upon proceeding through the mountainous area of the island, 
      a brief (and hilarious) sequence will follow.

      (As Yuffie will try to keep you from proceeding ahead -- and note 
       that the rest of the characters do not know that this is Yuffie's 
       hometown yet -- you encounter the Shinra guards.) 

(^o^) -> Have you noticed that all your materia orbs are missing? <- (^o^)
         
      (As the wind breezes by you, you soon realize that Yuffie had 
       taken off along with all your materia!  Through the entire journey
       with Yuffie, her main objective was to steal your materia! (^o^))

    o And so....hurry on up through the mountainous trails to Uutai, 
      Yuffie's hometown.  
     
    o Upon arriving in the town of Uutai, you will immediately notice
      Yuffie running away.  Go explore the town & find her.

      (If you go to the Kamedouraku bar, you will notice that the Taaks 
       are there - Reno, the leader of the Taaks, will not pursue to
       engage in a battle.)

      If you go to the item/materia shop (located next to the save-point
      flag), you will find a chest there - upon opening it, Yuffie will 
      jump down & steal that materia from you too!  (^o^)

      Go over to the house near the entrance of the town - 
      There, you will find Yuffie hiding behind the.....

      Go towards the outside entrance of the Kamedouraku bar - 
      you will find Yuffie hiding behind the.....

    o Upon catching Yuffie, she will agree to return all your materia.   
      After the little sequence with the Taaks, follow Yuffie to her 
      room - a brief sequence will follow.

      (...Yuffie recalls of the glory & power the town of Uutai had once 
       so long ago retained - However, that glory & power had shortly come 
       to an end upon losing in a battle...a battle to which despite the 
       very peace the town had achieved afterwards as you see now, it had
       lost something else along with it....something that once gave the
       people hope & dreams....

       Yuffie goes on to explain that because of this, she wanted to 
       obtain as much materia orbs to become stronger in helping regain
       that hope & glory her hometown had once achieved long ago....)

    o Yuffie will tell you to pull the left control lever/switch  
      to get all your materias back...  

[!] - You will be given the choices:
         Top Choice -> Pull the left lever/switch
      Bottom Choice -> Pull the right lever/switch

      And then.....

(^o^) -> Surprise, Surprise! - Yuffie has tricked you.....AGAIN! <- (^o^)
      
      (Yuffie will boastfully ridicule you for actually being so 
       gullible and for believing her little sad story!  You soon learn 
       that her true reason for stealing your materia was for money 
       and money alone.)
    
      (NOTE: In case if you were wondering about the level/switch choices, 
             pulling either one will get you the same result.)            

    o Leave Yuffie's house & head towards the high temple area, located 
      to the far left of the item/materia shop.  

    o Ring the big bell/gong - it will reveal a secret passage.
      Upon entering through the secret passage, you will encounter....
      ...Don Corneo! (remember this pervert back from the slum town?)
      He will claim both Yuffie & Irina (from the Taaks) as captives 
      for his own personal......deeds.  

    o After battling against the Shinra guards, leave the temple area.
      You will find the Taaks (Reno & Roodo) outside - you both agree
      to temporarily make truce for the time being until they can 
      reclaim back their captives.

    o Head towards the mountainous area of the Dachao statues, located
      towards the further northern end of the town.
      Battle your way through.

    o Upon finding Corneo & the captives (Yuffie & Irina), 
      prepare to battle against Corneo's new pet, "Rapusu".  
 
[!] - Upon defeating the subboss, Corneo will ask you:
      When should a person expect the worst in a given situation...
      You can respond: 
         Top Choice -> When a person is prepared to die. 
      Middle Choice -> When a person is winning/victorious.
      Bottom Choice -> When a person does not know what is going on.

      (Every choice will get you the same result - go ahead & pick any)

    o A brief sequence will follow, as Corneo has threatened to drop 
      the captives from their positions -- However, to Cloud's surprise, 
      Reno of the Taaks saves the captives and sends Corneo to his 
      well-deserved demise...

    o As the events follow, Yuffie will return all your materia - 
      She will even try to place & organize all the materias for you 
      on each character.  
  
      (Unfortunately, you will find that all the materias are mixed up 
       and placed on the wrong characters -- you will have to reequipt 
       all the materia on your own for each character.)

      Yuffie will still be persistant in joining with you on your journeys.
      And as usual, there will be some suspicious hidden motive behind
      her plans...  (^o^)

    o Your task here is done -- at least for now. 
      There are yet 2 other optional side events here as well, in dealing 
      with Yuffie's situation with her father and the passage within the 
      mountains, BUT I will come back to these later on in this guide.

    o Leave the island & board your plane once more.

(And now, back to the normal routine of game....)

    o Explore & become accustomed to the areas that you can access.
      
    o Across the river from the area of the Gold Saucer, there will be
      a little house near the edge of the shores, where you will find
      a blacksmith there.  Go there - you will learn about the "keystone"
      that will unlock the gates of an ancient ruins...
    
[!] - Talk to him once more.  You can ask him:
         Top Choice -> Ask him where this "keystone" is located.
         2nd Choice -> Ask him where the ancient ruins is located.
         3rd Choice -> Ask him a different topic.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not ask him anything.

      (If you chose the top choice (about the keystone), he will tell 
       you that he just sold the keystone to Dio, the manager of the 
       Gold Saucer.)

      (If you chose the 2nd choice (about the ancient ruins), he will
       tell you that as far as he knows, it is just a mere mythical 
       tale - however, he has heard rumors that the ancient ruins 
       contain a special destruction magical power deep within...)
  
      (If you chose the 3rd choice (about the different topic), he will
       boastfully tell you that all the weapons you see in the house are 
       his creation.  He will tell you that there recently has been a 
       shortage of supply in materials (such as mithril) to build with
       though...)

    o Your task now is to obtain the keystone from Dio at the Gold Saucer.
      Head over to the rural town of North Corel & ride the trailer to 
      get to the Gold Saucer.

[27.]---[ Gold Saucer - Getting the Keystone ]

    o Upon arriving in the Gold Saucer, head over to the Battle Square.
      In the Battle Square, there is a room called "Dio's Show Room", 
      where you will find the keystone on display.  Upon searching the
      keystone, Dio will enter the room - eventually, he will offer to 
      let you borrow the keystone if you (Cloud alone) enters the 
      battle arena & showcase Cloud's fighting abilities for Dio's 
      amusement.

      (Choose the top choice to agree to his terms & enter the arena)

[Tip!] - In the battle arena, you will be battling against groups of 
         monsters at a time by yourself (meaning 1 character only).
         Everytime you win a battle, you will be prompted to choose 
         if you wish to continue on fighting the next group of monsters.

          Left Choice -> Keep on fighting.
         Right Choice -> Stop fighting & leave the battle arena.

       - And, everytime you choose the left choice to keep on fighting, 
         a slot-machine will pop up, which will determine a random 
         handicap status your character will be in for the next fight.
 
         (SO, in other words, if you got a "MP" on your slot-machine 
          selection, your magic points may get halved or even disabled 
          for the next fight!  Or if you got a "LV-" on your slot machine
          selection, your character is decreased 5 or so levels down!
          But fortunately, the handicaps are only effective within the 
          Battle Square, so there is NO need to worry about the handicaps
          being permanent or such.)

    o After obtaining the keystone from Dio, head on out to the entrance
      of the Gold Saucer - you will soon learn that the trailer is 
      temporarily out of service at the moment.  Cait Sith will enter 
      the scene and urge you to rest at the hotel for the night.

    o As everyone gathers back together at the hotel, a brief sequence 
      will follow - In the course of the conversation, it becomes even 
      more clear that Sephiroth is also pursuing to obtain the destructive
      power of the "black materia"...

    o In your room, Aerith will shortly enter the scene, requesting 
      Cloud to accompany her on a date.  (^o^)!
 
[!] - Aerith will ask you if Cloud has ever gone on a date before.
      You can respond:
         Top Choice -> Of course you have.
      Bottom Choice -> To be honest, you have never gone on a date before.

      (I will leave this choice up to you)

    o As Cloud & Aerith arrives in the main jumpstation area,
      an event announcer will urge you to take part in the special 
      showcase inside.  As the 100th couple to enter in the event square, 
      Cloud & Aerith will find themselves as participants in the 
      special showcase!

     (...the showcase is of a mythical fairy tale in which a young hero
      comes to save the fair princess from the grasps of the evil dark
      dragon lord Valvados.  Cloud, who plays the obvious role of the young
      hero, will be requested by the king to save her daughter & princess, 
      Rusa, who is obviously played by Aerith.)
 
      ...and so, in defeating the evil dark dragon lord Valvados, the 
      king will tell you that you will need proper guidance from either 
      the knight or the wizard:

  [!] You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Talk to the knight.
      Bottom Choice -> Talk to the wizard.

  [!] After choosing one of the two, you can respond to them:
         Top Choice -> Tell him (the one you chose) to fight the dragon.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell him (the one you chose) to fight the king. (^o^)

  [!] ...and so, as the dark dragon Valvados comes enters the scene, 
      you will be challenged - you can:
         Top Choice -> Approach bravely towards Aerith & the dark dragon.
      Middle Choice -> Approach back towards the king.  
      Bottom Choice -> Run away cowardly.

      (the outcome will depend on what choices you made)

    o After the special showcase event, Aerith will suggest to ride the 
      gondora next at the Round Square area.  A visually impressive CG
      event will follow.

[Tip!] - Make sure to press [left] on the directional pad & the  
         [circle] button whenever Aerith looks out the window
         and urges you to watch.  

     (This event is extremely creative in its design & simply innovative
      in how it is executed w/its combo between fmv & polygonal usage.)

[!] o As Cloud & Aerith exit the gondora ride, she will ask you if 
      you would not mind going with her on the gondora ride sometime 
      in the future once more......you can respond:
         Top Choice -> Tell Aerith you do NOT want to go with her again.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell Aerith you do not mind going with her again.
       
      (I will leave this choice up to you - (^o^)
 
    o A sequence will shortly follow afterwards.
      You soon discover that Cait Sith has stolen the keystone!
      Well, what are you waiting for?  Chase after him!!

      (As the event begins to unfold, you soon learn that Cait Sith has 
       been working as an undercover spy for the Shinra Corp! -- moreover, 
       Cloud has no other choice but to allow Cait Sith to accompany 
       you on your journeys, upon learning that Marin (Barrett's "daughter")
       had fallen under the Shinra Corp's captivity...)

    o As everyone gathers back together in the hotel lobby, you will 
      be prompted to choose the characters you will take along with 
      you to the ancient ruins.

      (You will only be able to choose 1 character of your choice, as 
       both Cloud & Aerith are necessary to go on this mission.)

    o Your task now is to head off to the ancient ruins in search of 
      Sephiroth & the "black materia".
      Leave the Gold Saucer & board your plane.

[28.]---[ Ancient Ruins - The Black Materia ]
    
    o Head to the island of the Ancient Ruins, located near the lower 
      regions of the map.  

      (The island with the pyramid-like structure)

    o Upon arriving in the ancient ruins, a sequence will follow.
      You will find Tsuon (from the Taaks) within the structure, injured
      from Sephiroth's blows -- he will give you the keystone & urge you 
      to go inside after Sephiroth.

    o Using the keystone to enter inside, you will notice the vastly 
      interwoven paths & stairs leading to many areas. 
      Battle your way through.

[Tip!] - You will also notice an old dwarf running around from time to 
         time -- use them as guides to point out the path you should be 
         heading towards.  

       - When you see no more open paths or stairs readily available 
         to you, remember that there are plant vines located in some 
         regions that will allow you to climb down to a lower level.
         Some vines will seem to blend in with some of the sidewalls, 
         so be wary to look closely.

    o You will come across a hallway within, upon which you will notice 
      the tumbling boulders -- much like any action game, time your 
      actions accordingly with haste.
  
    o Upon managing to reach the other end of the hallway, Aerith will 
      urge you to follow her - she senses a great disturbance within
      the temple.  A brief sequence will follow.

      (...you soon learn that Sephiroth's objective was to "unite" with 
       the planet - all the planet's makoo energy & lifestream will 
       become a part of him...)

    o You will encounter an old dwarf at the end of the hallway.
      You can save your game here.

[!] - Talk to him.  You will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Rest & Replenish your characters.
      Middle Choice -> Save your game.
      Bottom Choice -> You are done.

    o Proceed on to the next room - it is the clock room of 12 paths.
      You must control the hour/minute/sec hands of the clock in order
      to get across to the various rooms.

[Tip!] - Here are the controls to operate the clock hands:
  
           o Press the [triangle] button to manually advance/change
             the movement of the clock hands.
           o Press the [circle] button to initiate a "roulette" rotation, 
             where the hands will all randomly rotate in motion.
             You will need to press the [circle] button once more to 
             stop the rotation.
           o Press the [X] button to move across the hands, once you 
             have set the desired course of path.
   
       - If you chose to press the [triangle] button and move the 
         clock hands manually, a new set of instructions will pop up.
            
         [!] You will be given choices:
                Top Choice -> Rotate the hands CLOCKWISE.
             Bottom Choice -> Rotate the hands COUNTER CLOCKWISE.
  
         [!] You will then be given more choices:
                Top Choice -> Move the hand VERY LITTLE.
                2nd Choice -> Move the hand SOME SPACES OVER.
                3rd Choice -> Move the hand A LOT.
             Bottom Choice -> Reset & return back to the main options.

    o Some of the paths will contain special artifacts or treasures to 
      obtain, whereas others may contain traps...

    o--> NOTE: If you bump into the second hand while trying to attempt 
               to across, you may find yourself falling down to the 
               very pits below.  Down in the pits, you will encounter....

[Tip!] - Here are the following results for each path:
         
           o     I = Trap Treasure Chest
           o    II = Blocked path
           o   III = Trap Treasure Chest
           o    IV = "Princess Guard" item
           o     V = Path outside (treasure chest)
           o    VI = "Chase the old dwarf" puzzle
           o   VII = Weapon for Cait Sith
           o  VIII = "Last Elixir" item
           o    IX = Blocked path  
           o     X = Original starting point
           o    XI = Blocked path
           o   XII = Subboss exit

         (Note: Results MAY be randomized & may vary per new game)
         
    o You must get across to the "VI" path, upon which you will 
      come across the "chase the old dwarf" puzzle, as I would like to say.
      Upon catching the dwarf, the door will open.
      Proceed on through the door.  A sequence will begin.....Sephiroth!!

      (...As Sephiroth goes on to explain his plan to "unite" with the 
       planet, you soon learn that in order for such a magnitude source
       of power from the planet's lifestream to be collected, a certain 
       level of damage much be inflicted upon the very planet....a damage
       to the degree of the planet's utter destruction....)

      (....and so, it becomes clear to you that the only source of power
       that could inflict a damage to such a degree would only be the 
       forthcoming of the legendary "meteor" -- the very reason why 
       Sephiroth needed the mystic energy of the "black materia"...)

      (...in an unexpected turn of event, Cloud will briefly lose control, 
       seemingly struggling to regain his own "true self", as if there
       were two separate personalities within him...)

    o Prepare to shortly battle against a dragon subboss.
     
[!] o Head over to the right side - you will find the "black materia"
      there.  You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Lightly move the black materia.
      Middle Choice -> Take the black materia.
      Bottom Choice -> Leave it alone.
 
      (Eventually, you will soon learn that the "black materia" is 
       actually the entire complex you are in right now - so, removing the 
       black materia from its current position would end up destroying 
       the complex itself...a rather "puzzling" dilemma...)  
  
[!] - Upon recieving the phone call from Cait Sith, you will be given 
      a choice in allowing him to help you. 
         Top Choice -> Trust Cait Sith in handling the situation.
      Bottom Choice -> No not trust Cait Sith.

      (Unfortunately, you really can only choose the top choice.
       The bottom choice will repeat in a looping responce.)

    o Leave the room & head back out through the "clock" path room.
   
    o Upon reaching the exit door, prepare to battle against a subboss.

    o As Cait Sith enters the scene, a brief sequence will follow.
      
      (Cloud, struggling to retain control of his own "true self", 
       once more experiences a brief moment of separation from his
       reality, as he unknowingly hands over the black materia to 
       Sephiroth....the black materia that will bestow upon Sephiroth
       the very power to summon the legendary "meteor"....)

      (...within the dream, you learn that Aerith has journeyed off 
       on her own to stop Sephiroth from summoning the "meteor"...)

[29.]---[ Gongaga Area - Cloud Awakens ]

[!] o Upon awaking from the dream, Tifa will ask you how you are feeing.
         Top Choice -> Tell Tifa you feel just fine.
      Middle Choice -> Tell Tifa you feel bad.
      Bottom Choice -> Tell Tifa you do not know anymore.

      (Cloud will express his hesitance & denial to continue on 
       fighting, as he fears he may lose himself once more to 
       Sephiroth's control...)

    o Leave the Gongaga Area.  Your task now is to head over towards 
      to the Bone Village, located towards the ice glaciers on the 
      upper region of the map.

[30.]---[ Bone Village - Finding the Luna Harp ]
 
    o Upon arriving in the Bone Village, you will soon learn that you 
      will need a "luna harp" in order to proceed through the forest.

[!] o Talk to the person sitting nearby the entrance.
      He will explain to you that in order to find the luna harp, you will
      need to proceed with the "hakkutsu", which is the procedure in which 
      the explosives are set to loosen the area you wish to search and 
      dig through.

      You will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Request for a "hakkutsu".
      Middle Choice -> Request to purchase items. (the usual shop items)  
      Bottom Choice -> Request nothing.

[!] - Upon selecting the top choice, in request for the "hakkutsu", 
      you will be given more choices:
         Top Choice -> Request to search for the Luna Harp specifically.
      Middle Choice -> Request to search for a pretty good item/treasure.
      Bottom Choice -> Request to search for a usual/normal item.

      (Go ahead & select the top choice, as you will need the luna harp 
       to proceed through the forest.  However, if you wish to search 
       for other special items before proceeding on, please do so.)

[Tip!] - There may be some special weapons or artifacts lying around 
         deep within the ground....

    o Upon selecting the choices for the "hakkutsu" procedure, 
      you will need to move Cloud to the specific spots/areas you want 
      the diggers to search.  Press the [square] button once you have 
      chosen your spot(s).

[!] - Once pressing the [square] button & selecting your spot, 
      you will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Place the digger at that spot - (Cost: 100 gil)
      Bottom Choice -> You do not need anymore diggers - you are done.

    - Upon finally setting up the specific locations of your diggers,
      press the [square] button once more to initiate the explosives.
      
    - Then go to one of the diggers & press the [square] button to choose
      the specific spot you want the digger to search through the night.

      (Note: you can only choose 1 digger to search)
      
    - In the morning, there may/may not be an item in the treasure box, 
      located near the entrance.  If you are trying to obtain the 
      luna harp, it may take some time & patience before finding it.  
  
[Tip!] - (Although it is not certain if the location of the luna harp 
          is randomized for each person's game, I had eventually found 
          the luna harp nearby the left side of the tent above.)

    o Upon obtaining the luna harp, proceed through the forest.

[TIp!] - (In the forest, a summoning materia orb will be floating about.
          It may blend within the forest, so make sure to look closely.
          Act quickly & grab it when you see it, for it will be moving 
          from one side to another.) 

    o Battle your way through - head towards the shell village.

[31.]---[ Shell Village - Aerith.... ]
  
    o Upon arriving within the shell village area, you will notice 
      that the path is further split into 3 separate paths.

[!] o Explore the areas.  Go to the shell house of the path on the
      upperright region - you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Rest for the night.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not rest.

      (You will need to choose the top choice in order to proceed.)
   
    o A brief sequence will follow - Cloud will sense the presence 
      of Aerith & Sephiroth....
  
    o Leave the shell house & head towards the central path.
      Within the shell structure, a new path will be revealed, 
      leading down the the very depths...

    o Upon finding Aerith, a sequence will follow.....

      (...Aerith...) (;.;)

    o As Sephiroth leaves the scene, prepare for a battle against a 
      subboss.
 
      (...as the tragic events unfold, Cloud soon realizes that there 
       lies a part of him that is not of his "true self"....a part 
       which had given Sephiroth the black materia....and...a part
       which would have killed Aerith if it had not been for Barrett
       and Tifa...)
  
[!] o As the tragic sequence ends, a message will pop up, informing you 
      that DISC 1 has ended.  You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Save your game right now.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not save your game now.

      (I will leave this choice up to you)   

========================================================================
EDITOR'S NOTE: And so, the 1st CD of your epic saga has come to its
               conclusion....You may be wondering what will come of 
               the planet, now that Sephiroth has the power to summon
               the legendary "meteor" -- or perhaps you may be wondering
               what Rufus & the Shinra Corp have under their corrupted
               sleeves in dealing with Sephiroth....and what about 
               the infamous Taaks?

               Only time will tell, as the answers to such questions lies
               within those 2 remaining CDs....

               Well, what are you waiting for?!  
               Hurry up and place that 2nd CD into your psx!!  (^o^)
========================================================================
[ FFVII Walkthrough : DISK 2 ] 
========================================================================

    o Proceeding to leave, follow Sephiroth through the shell valley 
      and past the caves.  Eventually, you will reach outside on top of
      the glacier regions.

    o Head to the village of GlacierLodge, towards the peak of the 
      mountains.

[1.]---[ Village of GlacierLodge ]

    o Upon arriving in the village of GlacierLodge, talk to the people
      and explore the buildings.

    o Go to the house located towards the eastern region of the village.
      (Nearby the area where the 2 children are building the snowman)
  
[!] - You will find a map of the glacier regions posted on a wall.
      If you search on it, you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Look at the map.
      Bottom Choice -> Take the map.

      (You may want to actually take the map, as you will find it 
       extremely useful during your upcoming journeys.)

[!] o Walk towards the very northern end of the village and 
      talk to the person walking nearby.  He will warn you not to 
      proceed on through the path - you will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> Ignore him and go through the path regardless.
      Bottom Choice -> Thank him for his kind words of wisdom.

      (Choose the top choice - a brief sequence will follow.)

    o As Irina (from the Taaks) and the two Shinra guards enter the scene,
      she will stop you from going any further and will accuse you for 
      what Sephiroth has done to Tsuon back at the ancient ruins.
      She will even attempt to take a swing at you!  (^o^)

[Tip!] - As the conversation ends, Irina will attempt to take a swing at 
         you.  Press [right] or [left] on the directional button and 
         you will be able to avoid her swing, resulting in her rather 
         hilarious exit out of the village.
 
    o Now head over to the little house, located within the central 
      region of the village (the house with the little boy).   Talk to 
      the little boy and he will offer to give you his Snowboard.
      Go over & pick up the snowboard.

[2.]---[ Snowboarding Down the Hill ]

    o Now that you have obtained the snowboard, you can now proceed on 
      through the path, located towards the very northeastern end of the 
      village.

    o Ok - the wind is gently breezing, the sun is shining brightly, and 
      the weather could not be any better.  Well, what are you waiting for?
      It is time to snowboard down that hill!!! (^o^)
 
[Tip!] - Here are the controls:

           o Press [right] and [left] on the directional pad to maneuver
             your controls.
           o Press the [X] button to jump.  The longer the [X] button is 
             held, the longer Cloud will stay in the air.
           o Press the [L1] or [R1] buttons accordingly to sharply shift
             over to the direction desired, while holding down on the 
             directional pad.  For example, holding [right] and pressing
             the [R1] button will maneuver Cloud to sharply curve over 
             towards the right.   
           o Press the [square] button to slow down & brake.
          
    o Upon reaching the end of your snowboarding fun, remember to use the
      map by pressing the [square] button to navigate your headings and 
      destinations.

[3.]---[ Snowy Turrain - The Journey Through ]

    o The main objective here is to reach the red check point, marked on 
      the map.  There are many possible routes you can take in reaching
      there -- along the way, you may come across certain areas or caves
      that contain special items or......
  
    o Upon nearing the region of the red check point (marked on the map), 
      you will encounter a snowy area that seemingly has no ends.
      
[Tip!] - When the blizzard clears away, use that momentary amount of time
         to make your move & run.  As you proceed on running, press the
         [circle] button to leave post marks as a trail behind you,  
         so that you will not easily lose your course of direction.
         Leaving these trails of post marks behind you may be necessary,
         as you may notice that the ground rotates around when the 
         blizzard covers the screen.  

    o Once you have managed to clear this particular region, you will 
      arrive in a mountainous area where you will find a little house 
      just to the right.  

    o Enter the house - You will finally be able to replenish your 
      characters and save your game.   Talk to the old man - he will 
      shortly explain to you that you will need to maintain your 
      body temperature at a stable condition in order to proceed 
      climbing the mountains up ahead.  

    o After resting & replenishing your characters, leave the house - 
      A brief sequence will follow.

    o Head towards the upper northern end of the path, leading up to the 
      mountainous cliffs.  Climb up the cliffs & make your way through 
      the caves.

    o--> NOTE: You will notice the temperature gauge on the lower lefthand
               corner, fluctuating up & down.  You will need to rapidly 
               tap the [square] button to raise & maintain a stable 
               body temperature so that you can proceed on climbing.  
               If your body temperature decreases beyond 25 or so, 
               Cloud will collapse and you will find yourself back at 
               the little house.

               So, a good stategy in this particular situation would 
               be to tap the [square] button until you can maintain a 
               body temperature degree of 38 of so.  Then quickly rush
               over to the cliff wall & starting climbing up hastely.
               Upon reaching each platform, repeat the process of raising
               the body temp & quickly climb the cliffsides.

               As you climb, from time to time you will come across 
               choices as to the specific directions you can head towards 
               (ie. right, left, up, down).
      
[Tip!] - Within the 1st cave, you will need to push a boulder in order 
         to open up another passage...

       - Within the 2nd cave, all four ice blocks must be broken off 
         to fit in the holes below...

       - Within the 3rd cave, a subboss awaits you...
         ...Left Head is weak against normal attacks. 
         ...Right Head is weak against magic attacks.

    o Upon finally arriving at the peak of the mountain,
      a brilliantly sequenced CG will follow.
   
    o Proceed on down the path towards the inner core of the crater.
      If you do not have Tifa in your party already, she will enter 
      the scene and insist on joining you.
   
[Tip!] - To pass through the 1st energy barrier, you will need to 
         time your course of action carefully -- watch for the energy 
         barrier to become lighter in its transparency...

       - To pass through the 2nd energy barrier, you will have to 
         keep an even more careful watch on your timing, as there are
         now TWO separate energy waves fading in & out at different 
         rhythms...

[4.]---[ The Great Awakening - "Meteor"... ]

    o Upon encountering Sephiroth, prepare to battle against a subboss.

    o Tifa will shortly urge you to have one of the other characters 
      hold onto the black materia, as Cloud fears that he may once more 
      lose control of his "true self".

[!] - Talk to Red XIII - he will be willing to take hold of the black 
      materia and guard it as the others head off to confront Sephiroth...
      You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Give the black materia to Red XIII.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not give the black materia to Red XIII.

      (Unfortunately, the sequence of events are set up so that 
       none of the others would be willing to guard the black materia - 
       thus, incidently (and so conveniently for the programmers) Red XIII 
       comes out as the only actual selectable character to give the 
       black materia to.)

    o Proceed on through the 3rd energy barrier (this one is a killer). 
                    
    o Upon eventually managing to get through the 3rd energy barrier, 
      a series of sequences will shortly follow, as the scenery will 
      suddenly alter to Cloud's "flashbacks" recreated by Sephiroth...  

      (...as you seemingly find yourself within the town of Niburuhelm, 
       once home to Cloud & Tifa, it soon becomes clear that you are 
       re-experiencing the very moment upon which Sephiroth & Cloud had 
       first arrived in Niburuhelm 5 years ago -- but something is 
       different....it was not Cloud....)
 
      (...the scenery will soon again alter -- to the very moment upon 
       which Sephiroth had bestowed the unfortunate fate upon Niburuhelm 
       5 years ago, as the town stood there in utter devastation...
       ...and yet again, it was not Cloud...)
  
      (...the scenery will once again alter -- as Sephiroth enters the 
       scene, it is soon revealed to you that these "recreated" memories 
       are in fact the actual reality to which had preceded in history...
       Everything that Cloud remembers....about being with Tifa...about 
       the incidents 5 years ago...about even becoming a "1st Class" 
       Shinra soldier....everything -- only mere false creations implanted 
       within his mind...)

      (As the course of events follow, Cloud - completely lost within his 
       struggle to regain his "true self" and reality - retrieves the 
       black materia from Red XIII...it is at this very moment, upon 
       which it becomes clear that the Cloud they see now, is seemingly 
       one of Hojou's "creations" as a result of the Jenova Project...)

      (The summoning of the legendary "meteor" has been finally begun...)

[5.]---[ Inside the Shinra Airbase ]

    o Upon awakening within the Shinra's airbase, talk to Barrett - 
      a brief sequence will follow.  Rufus will enter the scene
      to inform you of your sentence for execution, as you are held 
      evidently responsible for the summoning of the meteor.
      Follow Tifa and the Shinra guard.

    o As Tifa is taken to the gas chamber, a sequence will follow. 
      
     (You will soon learn that the Shinra airbase is being attacked by 
      the "Weapon" - the legendary guardian monster of the planet, which
      was awakened by the great summoning...)

    o Cait Sith will come to your rescue!  Upon battling the guards, 
      head over to the gas chamber door. 

      (A brilliantly sequenced CG fmv will follow, as the scene will 
       briefly switch over to the battle against the "weapon".)

    o As Barrett will not be able to open the gas chamber door, 
      you will need to temporarily leave her behind.  Head on out of the 
      airbase corridors and battle your way through.
 
    o You will find Yuffie - disguised as a news reporter - on the 
      upper level of the airbase.  She will urge you to head towards
      the airport region of the base.

    o Go to the airport - towards the location of the airship.
      (The scene will then switch over to Tifa.)
  
    o In this particular situation, the main objective is to get Tifa
      released from the chair, using the buttons to control her movements.

[Tip!] - Here are the controls:

            o Press the [triangle] button to move her head.
            o Press the [square] button to move her right hand.
            o Press the [circle] button to move her left hand.
            o Press the [X] button to move her legs.

            o Note: You will need to use the combination of two buttons 
                    or movements in order to accomplish certain other 
                    movements.  (ie. Pressing [X]+[triangle] to grab the 
                                     key from her legs.)

    o After managing to get Tifa released from the chair, you will 
      need to find a switch in the room to turn off the gas.
      Search the chamber door afterwards - a brief sequence will follow.

    o Upon climbing out of the gas chamber, proceed on heading down 
      towards the edge of the cannon. (far northern region of the screen)
      
      (You will notice that a hand-icon will pop up over Tifa, 
       to help you keep track of where she is, as she heads further 
       and further into the distance.)

    o Reaching the very edges of the cannon, a sequence will take place 
      between you and Scarlet, one of the head officials of the Shinra 
      corp.  

      Prepare to battle it out against Scarlet in a match of....
      ....SLAPPING!  (^o^)!

[Tip!] - Within this battle of slapping, you will need to quickly 
         tap the [circle] button.

      (As Scarlet & the Shinra guards begin to close in on Tifa, 
       head towards the very edge of the cannon, upon which one of the 
       most spectacular scenes of rescue will take place.)

[6.]---[ Inside the Airship "Highwind" ]

    o Now aboard the airship, head down to the main control room,
      where you will find everyone (with the exception of Cloud) there.
      Talk to everyone.

      (In the course of the conversations, Red XIII will suggest that 
       you head to an island where the "lifestream" is flowing.)

[!] - You will need to also talk to the pilot at the front controls
      in order to initiate navigating the airship.
      When talking to him, he will give you a choice:
         Top Choice -> Proceed on navigating the airship.
      Bottom Choice -> Do not navigate the airship yet.

[Tip!] - Here are the controls for navigating the airship:
       
            o Use the directional key pad to maneuver & control the 
              direction of the airship.
            o Press the [circle] button to move.
            o Press & Hold the [square] button to strife.
            o Press the [R1] button to turn right.
            o Press the [L1] button to turn left.
            o Press the [triangle] button to switch back to the 
              inside of the airship.
            o Press the [X] button to land on the ground.  
              (you must be hovering over clear land)
            o Press the [select] button to enable/disable the map.

    o Your task now is to head towards the village of Mideel, located 
      within a small island of the southeastern region of the map.

[OP!] HOWEVER, before continuing on with the normal routine of your 
  |   saga, I will now sidetrack to an optional event which will take 
  |   place yet again in Yuffie's hometown -- so, what this means is that
  |   you will need to have found Yuffie already.  If you have not found
  |   Yuffie yet or plan to recruit her later in the game, you can skip 
  |   over this optional event section & come back to it later.
  |   This particular optional event deals with Yuffie's relational 
  |   situation with her father...
  |
[OP!]---[ Town of Uutai - Back in Yuffie's Hometown ]

    o--> NOTE: You MUST have Yuffie in your battle/traveling party
               for the duration of this particular optional event.

    o Upon arriving in the town of Uutai, head towards the high temple, 
      located within the far northwestern region of the town.  
      (the tallest temple there)

[!] o Entering the high temple, talk to the person there - 
      He will recognize Yuffie and will ask her if she is ready/prepared
      to face the 5 levels of challenge within the high temple.
      You can respond:
         Top Choice -> "Of course you are ready."
      Bottom Choice -> "Of course not!"

      (Choose the top choice to face the challenge that awaits Yuffie) 

[Tip!] - The objective of this high temple is for Yuffie to battle 
         through each of the 5 levels within the temple.  On each level, 
         there will be an opponent awaiting your challenge. 
 
       - Your Opponents:  o 1st Floor: Gooriki (3000~hps)
                          o 2nd Floor: Sheik   (4000~hps)
                          o 3rd Floor: Chehoff (5000~hps)
                          o 4th Floor: Staniff (6000~hps)
                          o 5th Floor: Godo    (10000~hps)
   
    o Once confronting & defeating Yuffie's father, Godo, you will
      shortly obtain the "leviathan" summoning materia orb.
 
      (Within the following sequence, Yuffie manages to open her 
       father's eyes & heart to reason and to understand the amount of 
       constraint he has placed upon their village -- Godo soon comes to 
       realize that his better judgement & sense of order was clouded 
       when he had lost the war long ago...)

    o Your task here is done -- at least for now. 
      There is yet another optional side event here as well, taking place
      within the mountains high above, BUT I will come back to this later
      on, as you will first need to obtain a special artifact in order 
      to proceed...

    o Leave the island & board your airship once more.
      
(And now, back to the normal routine of game....)

    o Head towards the village of Mideel, located within a small island
      of the southeastern region of the map.

[7.]---[ Village of Mideel ]

    o Upon arriving in the village of Mideel, explore the town.
      A sequence will soon follow - You will soon learn of Cloud's 
      presence within the village! -- however.....

      (...it shortly becomes clear that as a result of being exposed to 
       such massive amounts of mako energy that had preceded during the 
       great summoning of the "meteor", Cloud has suffered from a severe
       condition of memory loss to such a degree that he no longer 
       can realize his own identity....his own reality....)

      (As the course of events follow, Tifa will decide to stay behind
       with Cloud in the village -- Meanwhile, returning back to your 
       airship, Cait Sith will inform you of the Shinra's plans to 
       obtain the "Huge Materia" which would eventually bestow upon them 
       a destruction force of such magnitude that would destroy not only 
       the meteor but also anyone who would ever oppose the Shinra Corp.)

      (In an unsuspected turn of event, Cid will be chosen to become 
       the leader in place of Cloud for the mission. (^o^)!
       
    o Controlling Cid, head towards the Operations Room & talk to the 
      person inside to choose the remaining characters to take along 
      with you.  Head back to the main control room & navigate the airship.

    o Your task now is to head towards the makoro complex located near 
      North Corel, in pursuit of stopping the Shinra Corp.
     
      (In case you may have forgotten the location of North Corel, 
       it is the rural village just nearby the Gold Saucer.)

[8.]---[ North Corel Makoro - Train Sequence ("Huge Materia" #1) ] 
     
    o Upon arriving in the rural village of North Corel, proceed on 
      through the other entrance (connected from the long bridge)
      and battle your way through to the Makoro complex.
      The train sequence will follow.

    o As you manage to find a train to chase after the Shinra, 
      your objective now is to catch up to their train & board it, 
      battle your way up through to the main control, and stop the 
      train before it crashes through the village of North Corel -- 
      This must be completed within the given 10 minutes.

[Tip!] - In catching up with the Shinra train, Cid must quickly 
         pull the 2 levers back & forth, in a steady motion repeatedly.
             
         o Press the [triangle] button to pull the right lever.
         o Press [up] on the directional key pad to pull the left lever.
  
         (So, in other words, you will need to quickly tap [up], [tri],
          [up], [tri], [up], [tri] - over and over in a steady yet fast
          motion)
       
         (The faster you press them, the sooner you will begin to catch 
          up with the train)

       - Once you board the Shinra's train, battle your way up through 
         to the controls.  In stopping the train, you will need to 
         quickly tap: - [Up]+[Triangle]
                      - [Down]+[X]
                      - Press the [circle] button to clear the messages
  
         (For those of you who are still not completely sure what to do 
          to make the train stop, simply bashing all the buttons will 
          also work too.  (^o^)

    o This train sequence has 2 separate outcomes:
 
       [1] If you managed to stop the train from crashing through the
           village of North Corel, you will get
               - The Huge Materia
               - free night stay at the inn to rest & replenish characters
               - "Ultima" Materia Orb  (^o^)!
          
       [2] If you could not stop the train in time & it crashes through
           the village, you will get:
               - The Huge Materia
               - a lot of dead people on your hands (;.;)

    o Your task here is done - board your airship & head towards the 
      "Condo Fort" - the fort with the large golden condo sitting on the 
      peak.  

[9.]---[ Battle at Condo Fort - ("Huge Materia" #2) ]

[!] o Upon arriving at the condo fort, talk to the guard standing outside.
      As he will request for your assistance in battling the Shinra 
      army, you will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Refuse his request.
      Bottom Choice -> Agree to assist him.

      (Choose the bottom choice)

    o Talk to the old man sitting at the table - he will explain the 
      situation to you regarding the upcoming battle against the Shinra 
      army.

      (You soon come to learn that there lies a powerful materia orb 
       within the area just below where the golden condor stands - 
       the very reason for which the Shinra Corp has begun attacking. 
       And so, your task now is to battle against the Shinra army as 
       you take role as a commander over a fleet of an army & position 
       them as you would in any war simulation game.)

    o Proceed on up the ladder/stairs and talk to the person watching
      over the area -- he will explain to you the specific instructions 
      and tactics for battling the Shinra Army within this little 
      war-simulation mini game.

[!] o You will soon be given choices regarding the specific topics 
      of the battle tactics:
         Top Choice -> Ask about the objectives in winning.
         2nd Choice -> Ask about the specific info on the enemy troops.
         3rd Choice -> Ask about the specific info on your army troops.
         4th Choice -> Ask about the money supply reserved for your army.
         5th Choice -> Ask about other topics.
      Bottom Choice -> Ask no more - end conversation.

[!] o Once choosing the bottom choice to ask no more questions, 
      you will then be asked if you are prepared/ready:
         Top Choice -> You are not prepared/ready yet.
      Middle Choice -> You are prepared/ready.
      Bottom Choice -> Ask him about the specific topics once more.

      (Choose the middle choice once you are ready to initiate the 
       war simulation/battle)

[Tip!] - Here are the controls (prior to battle):
  
            o Use the directional key pad to position your troops.
            o Press the [circle] button to choose the type of troop.
            o Press the [X] button to recall your previous decision.
              Also press the [X] button to finalize your setup to attack.
              [!] - Top Choice -> Begin war.
                 Bottom Choice -> Do not begin war.
  
       - Here are the controls (during battle):
 
            o Use the directional key pad to select the troop to command.
            o Press the [circle] button over the specific troop to 
              give it instructions/command.
            o Press the [X] button to recall your previous decision.
            o Press the [start] button to pause the game.
            o Press the [select] button to bring up the help window.
            o Press the [R1] or [R2] button to speed up the battle.
            o Press the [L1] or [L2] button to slow down the battle.
     
       - The main objective of this mini-war simulation game is to 
         battle your way through past the enemy's lines and defeat 
         all incoming enemy troops.         
          
       o--> NOTE: During in midst of the battle, you can recruit more 
                  troops - just simply click on any open space within 
                  <your> side of the battle field and select the 
                  specific troop you wish to purchase/recruit.  

       - Should you lose the war-simulation battle, prepare to 
         battle against a subboss, in the normal battle sequence style.

    o Upon winning/losing the war-simulation battle, a brief sequence 
      will follow.  Head outside towards where the condor egg hatched.
      Make sure to pick up the "Phoenix" summoning materia orb.

    o Heading back inside, talk to the old man sitting at the table 
      once more - he will give you the "Huge Materia".

      (In the course of the conversation, you soon learn that the old 
       man had the huge materia all along - and despite the little 
       mispresumption, it soon becomes clear to you that the old man 
       needed your assistance not for the reason of keeping the Shinra
       army from obtaining the huge materia, but rather for the very 
       reason of protecting/preserving the condor egg's life.)

    o Your task here is done - board your airship once more.
      Head back to the village of Mideel. (where Cloud & Tifa are) 

[10.]---[ Back in the Village of Mideel ]

[^o^]! o Upon arriving in the village of Mideel, explore the various 
       | shops & merchant stores - you will have noticed (if not already)  
[OP!]  | the little white chocobos running around within the shops. 
       |   
       | If you follow the specific sequences listed below, you will be 
       | able to obtain the "Fuuin" materia orb!  
       |
       | o First you will need the "Mimetto" plant food prior to
       |   proceeding, which can be bought from Gren-Gren at the chocobo 
       |   farm for 1500 gil each.
       | o Upon purchasing the "Mimetto" plant food, go ahead & talk to 
       |   the little white chocobo running around.
       |
       |   [!] You will be given a choice:
       |          Top Choice -> Give it the "Mimetto" plant food.
       |       Bottom Choice -> Do not give it anything.
       |
       | o Proceeding to choose the top choice (give it the plant food), 
       |   you will be given another set of choices in petting the little 
       |   white chocobo:
       |      Top Choice -> Pet its feet area.
       |      2nd Choice -> Pet its stomach.
       |      3rd Choice -> Pet its throat.
       |      4th Choice -> Pet its belly.
       |      5th Choice -> Pet its ears.
       |      6th Choice -> Pet its underwings.
       | 
       | o Proceeding to choose the 5th choice (the side of its ears), 
       |   you will now obtain the "Fuuin" materia orb!
       | 
[^o^]! | o There is also yet another hidden item you can obtain in this 
       |   village.  Go to the weapons shop.
[OP!]  |
       | o In the weapons shop, you will notice a door towards the back.
       |   Search the door - you will need a key to possibly open the door.
       |
       | o Leave the shop & head towards the far left area, where the 
       |   old man is standing outside.  Search around the area just behind
       |   where the old man is standing -- you should hear a "clicking"
       |   sound soon.
       |
       | o Search that area of the "clicking" sound - you will find an
       |   old, rusted key!  Head back to the weapons shop.
       |
       |   [!] Try to use the rusted key on the door.
       |       You will be given choices:
       |          Top Choice -> Use the rusted key.
       |       Bottom Choice -> Do not use the rusted key.
       |
       | o Go ahead & use the key (top choice).
       |   
       |   [!] As you find that your rusted key broke, the store owner 
       |       will ask what happened - you can respond:
       |          Top Choice -> Try to lie your way out.
       |       Bottom Choice -> Tell the truth & apologize.
       |
       |   (You soon learn that the "door" was no more than a mere 
       |    painting on the wall! - (^o^)!
       |   
       | o You will now obtain the "Ring of the cursed" artifact!
       |
       o--------o
  
    o Proceed to the village hospital - talk to Tifa.
      A sequence will follow.

    o Head outside - prepare to battle against the "weapon".
      A cg fmv sequence will soon follow.
      
[11.]---[ Tifa & Cloud: Within the Lifestream.... ]

   (Upon falling into the depths of the lifestream, Tifa will find 
    herself within Cloud's struggles to find his true "reality"...)

    o Talk to each Cloud - each one represents a part of Cloud's 
      fragmented memories...

      (You soon learn that it was not Cloud who had returned to 
       Niburuhelm with Sephiroth as the "1st class soldier" - 
       Tifa had awaited for his arrival...but never saw him.

       Ashamed for not becoming the soldier that he had hoped to be, 
       Cloud could not reveal himself to Tifa - but even this being so, 
       it soon becomes clear that Cloud had still kept his promise to 
       look after Tifa to the very end...)

    o Upon returning back to the airship, your next task is to obtain 
      the huge materia #3, located within the depths of the ocean makoro 
      of Junon.   
  
[12.]---[ Junon - Huge Materia #3 ]

    o Head towards the Junon area (the area of Shinra cannon airbase).
    
    o Talk to the Shinra guard standing in front of the elevator gate - 
      choose the top choice to agree in paying 10 gil for passage through.
      Activate the elevator upon entering.
  
    o Make your way through the Shinra airbase complex and 
      head towards an underpass (with the shinra army group) which will 
      lead to the ocean makoro.        

    o Battle your way through - upon eventually finding the huge materia, 
      you will encounter Reno (of the Taaks).
      Prepare to battle against a subboss mech-robot.

    o Head towards the submarine & battle against the Shinra guards.
      
[Tip!] - Make sure to pick up the treasure chest items located just 
         around the submarine - one of them will contain a special item 
         that will be necessary for a side event later on in the game.   

    o Upon entering the submarine, head towards the main control room.
[!] - Search the chair - you will be given a set of choices:
         Top Choice -> View the navigational instructions
      Middle Choice -> Sit in seat
      Bottom Choice -> Leave everything alone

    o Your task now is to navigate the submarine & destroy all incoming
      enemy submarines and importantly, destroy the red submarine 
      carrying the huge materia!
      You will have a time limit of <10 minutes>. 

[Tip!] - Here are the controls to navigate the submarine:
            
         - Use the directional pad to maneuver the submarine
         - Press the [triangle] button to shift upward
         - Press the [X] button to shift downward
         - Press the [square] button to fire torpedo
         - Use the radar sensory map to coordinate your attacks
          
    o Once ready to battle the enemy submarines, choose the middle 
      choice to sit in the seat.  Finally, choose the 2nd choice 
      to engage.

    o After defeating the red submarine, you will soon learn that 
      the Shinra corp have obtained the last huge materia & taken 
      it to the Rocket village.
       
    o Your task now is to head towards the Rocket village, stop the 
      Shinra army & obtain the huge materia #4.

[Tip!] - Before heading out to the Rocket village, board the submarine 
         & search the ocean depths for the red submarine that you sunk - 
         you can obtain the 3rd huge materia.  

       - Although optional for now, there is also the shell key that 
         is hidden within the depths of the ocean cavern.  There is also 
         another sunken submarine, where you can obtain several useful
         artifacts.

[13.]---[ Rocket Village - Huge Materia #4 ]

    o Upon arriving in the Rocket village, head towards the rocket - 
      prepare to battle against Rudo (of the Taaks) and the shinra 
      guards.

    o Head to the main control room.
      You will soon learn that the Shinra corp had planned to 
      use the huge materia incased within the rocket against the 
      meteor.

    o As the rocket heads within a collision course towards the 
      meteor, you must now obtain the huge materia #4 - 
      Enter the passcode required to release the huge materia.
       
[Tip!] - The passcode consists of pressing 4 buttons on your 
         controller pad.  You must input the correct sequence of 
         buttons.

         Passcode:  [Circle], [Square], [X], [X]

    o Upon boarding the airship, Red XIII will suggest going to the 
      cosmo canyon & talking to Boogen-Haagen.

NOTE: If you have not obtained the huge materia #3 from the sunken 
      submarine already, do so before going to the cosmo canyon.

[14.]---[ Cosmo Canyon ]

    o Head to the Cosmo Canyon and talk to Boogen-Haagen.
      It will soon be decided to head towards the shell village, 
      where Aerith had confronted Sephiroth.  Boogen-Haagen will 
      insist on joining you on this particular mission.
    
      Cloud will leave all four huge materias within the room.
[!] - In approaching each huge materia, you will be given choices:
         Top Choice -> View the huge materia closer.
      Middle Choice -> Leave the huge materia alone.
      Bottom Choice -> Leave room & head down.

[Tip!] - Each huge materia represents a specific type of special materia.
         In order to obtain the special materia(s) formed from each huge 
         materia, you must have "mastered" or obtained the required 
         materia orbs.

         HUGE

         Note: Come back to this room whenever you are ready to obtain 
               the special materia from any one of the huge materia 
               and have met the specific requirements.
 
    o Upon boarding the airship, head towards the shell village.

[14.]---[ Shell Village ]

    o Head within the left side cavern of the shell village - 
      a sequence will take place.

Note: You will need to have already obtained the shell key, located 
      within the depths of the ocean caverns.

      (You soon learn that in time it will be the planet that will 
       decide the very fate of all life, whether to be healed by the
       mystical "holy" of the white materia or to face the utter 
       devastation of the meteor...

       Within the carved ancient writings, it is revealed to you of 
       a "key" and a "orugouru".  Boogen-Haagen will then suggest to 
       use the shell key that you had found within the depth of the 
       ocean - as a result, it will release the mystical waterfall 
       revealing an image screen interface...

       Cloud soon becomes to realize that Aerith had known all along
       what had to be done...and at the cost of her very life...)

    o Upon leaving the scene, Cloud will receive a call from the other
      characters (Cait Sith), informing him of Rufus' (president of 
      Shinra corp) intentions to use the Jenon canon to destroy 
      Sephiroth, with the power released from all the makoro of Midgar.
       
    o Leave the shell village & head towards Midgar.
      A sequence will follow - the "Weapon" has risen & approaching 
      Midgar!  Head towards Midgar & wait nearby the shores to confront
      the "weapon".  
   
      A CG sequence will follow.

    o Head towards the crater within the glacier mountains - 
      another sequence will follow. 
  
      (Within the midst of the uprising from the damage inflicted upon 
       by the "weapon", overwhelming the stability of the makoro complex 
       in Midgar, the scientist Hojou places Midgar in further danger,
       overloading the makoro & planning to use its energy for his own
       twisted purposes with Sephiroth...)

    o And so, your task now is to head back to Midgar & stop Houjou.

[15.]---[ Midgar : The Battle Within... ]

    o Head towards Midgar - before dropping down to the surface, 
      you will be prompted to choose if you wish to change your 
      member party.
[!] - You will be given these choices:
         Top Choice -> Yes : Change your member party characters.
      Bottom Choice -> No : Leave the member party as is.

    o Follow Cait Sith - talk to Cait Sith when you are ready to 
      battle your way through the underground complex & tunnels, 
      leading to the Makou Canon.
  
[!] - Within the underground train tunnels, you will eventually 
      be confronted by the Taaks (Leno, Irina, & Rudo).  
      You will be given a choice:
         Top Choice -> Engage the Taaks in a battle.
      Bottom Choice -> Choose not to battle against the Taaks.

      (I will leave this option up to you)

    o Upon reaching near the makou canon area, prepare to battle
      against Haidekka & Scarlet and their massive robot.

    o Battle your way up towards the makou canon - 
      you will soon confront Hojou, whom you will soon find out 
      that he was actually Sephiroth's biological father during 
      the Jenova Project - Prepare to battle Hojou.

    o After managing to defeat Hojou from engaging the makou canon, 
      you will return to the airship once more, following with a 
      sequence of conversational events.
       
      (As it soon becomes clear that there lies only 7 days left before 
       the oncoming of the meteor, Cloud insists for each character to 
       discover & realize their true reasoning for fighting...whether if
       it is for the planet or for the future of all life...or...
       ...or rather is it for a personal reason? 
 
       And so, he asks that each person to return to their origin 
       to make sure of their true reasoning for fighting, as he 
       states that one cannot fight without realizing the true reasoning 
       for one's actions...)
  
     o Once everyone is found to surprisingly return, your final mission 
       is set - to battle against Sephiroth to the very end...

[!] o You will soon be informed that DISC 2 has ended -  
      You will be given a choice:

========================================================================

    o As the 3rd CD is primary reserved for your final battle against 
      Sephiroth, here are some tips that may help you along your 
      way to the end:

      - In battling through the inner caverns of the last dungeon to 
        Sephiroth, the first two areas may come as a little confusing
        to get down to the bottom, as there are some areas of the screen 
        that blend end well with the rendered background and may be rather
        hard to distinguish as accessable areas.

      - Within the depths of the inner caverns, you will eventually 
        come across a point where all your characters will gather 
        together to split into 2 groups.  Choose the specific characters
        you want to head either to the right path or the left path.
           
      - There are many special materia orbs that are hidden throughout 
        the inner caverns.  Here are some that you may want to espcially 
        look for:

            o Command Counter : Enables character to counter enemy's
                                attack with the combined counter materia

            o Subete Zentaika : Enables all of character's materia and 
                                attack/defense abilities to affect 
                                multiple targets

            o Shield : Mahoo (spell) materia that casts a combination
                       of both "Barrier" & "MaBarrier" effect

            o HP Kyushu : Allows the combined mahoo (spell) materia to 
                          drain a portion of the enemy's HP values as well

            o Save-Point Item : Allows you to create a save-point flag 
                                in any location, allowing you to save 
                                your game at the most critical point of 
                                your journey.

      - When confronting Sephiroth, you will have the option of switching
        between the group parties between each round.  If your main 
        group party is powerful enough, you will easily find that there 
        really is no need to switch between the groups.

[ MAIN MENU ]: The <MAIN MENU> control screen is one of the key elements 
               in the game to which you must master in the course of your
               journeys - this includes some of the primal tasks such as 
               equipting/customizing various materia orbs & weapons,
               configuring your game setup, using items, saving your game, 
               and much MUCH more.  This is the main control interface that 
               you live & breath by within this game.

             o There are 10 specific submenus within the main menu to which 
               you must learn to master (from top to bottom):

    #1. [ Item ]: This will show you all the items you have obtained so far 
                  in the course of your saga.  Note that this <Item> 
                  submenu will also be accessable during battle sequences.

                  Within the <Item> Submenu, there will be 3 other
                  submenus:  
                             
                      - [ Use ]: This is the default selection within your  
                                 <Item> submenu, in which you can use the
                                 various items/accessories.

                      - [ Lineup ]: This option allows you to customize the
                                    order in which your items are organized.

                      - [ Key Item ]: This selection window will show you
                                      all the "key items" you have obtained
                                      in the course of your journeys.  
                                      These key items are used during the 
                                      important sequences/events in the 
                                      game.
              
    #2. [ Magic ]: This will show you all the magic spells/abilities 
                   your character(s) possess.  Note that the specific magic
                   spells are determined by the amount & type of materia 
                   orbs the character(s) are equipted with.

                   Within the <Magic> Submenu, there will be 3 other
                   submenus:  
                             
                      - [ Magic ]: This is the default selection within 
                                   your <Magic> submenu, showing you all 
                                   the spells your character(s) can cast.
                                   If you have the "Cure" materia orb 
                                   equipted, you will be able to cast the 
                                   spell to replenish your characters
                                   during the normal "travel" mode as well. 

                      - [ Summoning ]: If you have any "shookan"/summoning
                                       materia orbs equipted, you will be 
                                       able to view all the specific 
                                       summoning spells your character(s)
                                       can cast.

                      - [ Enemies' Ability ]: If you have the "Enemy's 
                                              Ability" materia orb, you 
                                              will be able to view all the
                                              specific spells/attacks you
                                              have gained from learning the
                                              various enemies that you have
                                              battled against.

    #3. [ Materia ]: This will show you all the materia orbs your 
                     character(s) are currently equipted with. 
                     Learn to master how to best equipt the materia orbs
                     soon, as it will determine which spells your 
                     characters will be able to cast and the level at 
                     which the materia orbs will progress.

    #4. [ Equipt ]: This selection will allow you to equipt the various 
                    weapons, armor, and accessories that you purchase/find
                    in the course of your journeys.  
  
               o--> Note that each weapon/armor has a specific attribute
                    in determining the amount of materia orbs it can 
                    carry and in determining the level progression rate of
                    the materia orbs it carries.

                    As with the previous installments of the FF series, 
                    the specifications for each weapon/armor will be 
                    shown to you - use it to determine which weapon/armor
                    is best suited for each of your character(s).

    #5. [ Status ]: This will show you the current specifications your 
                    character(s) are currently in - this includes the 
                    basic stats of your character(s)' strength, magic power,
                    defense level, limit levels, luck, etc. 
   
    #6. [ Lineup ]: This will show you the order & setup in which your 
                    characters will face against the enemies in battle.
                    This includes their positioning - as in whether the
                    character(s) will face the enemies from the front 
                    row or the back row.                
 
               o--> Note that the character(s) positioned in the front
                    row will have greater attack/strength power but
                    will have decreased/lesser defense power.
                  
               o--> Note that the character(s) positioned in the back row
                    will have greater defense/evade level but will have 
                    decreased/lesser attack power.  
  
          [Tip!]--> As a basic strategy rule in your battle sequences, 
                    have your lesser HP characters positioned in the back
                    row and the greater HP characters positioned in the 
                    front.  Also note that the amount of damage/effect 
                    from your magical spells have no relation with the 
                    positioning of your character(s).

    #7. [ Limit ]: This will show you all the special "limit" attacks 
                   your character(s) have learned in the course of your 
                   journeys.  You will also notice that there are 4 
                   specific "levels" categorized in the <limit> submenu.
                   Each character can only use a specific limit level 
                   at a time.  (ie. Level 1 limit only)

                   In order to switch/set your character(s) to use the 
                   other limit levels, you must choose the top choice
                   listed as "Set" and select the new level you desire.

              o--> Note that your character(s) must have learned the 
                   new limit level attacks before you can set to the
                   new level.  So, what this means is that your 
                   character(s) must first gradually learn the new limit 
                   level attacks in order to use them -- until then, 
                   the newer levels will be shaded out in your window.
 
    #8. [ Configuration ]: As with the previous installments of the FF
                           series, this will allow you to customize the 
                           specific conditions of the game.
                           (ie. message speed, stereo/mono, cursor, etc.)

    #9. [ PHS ]: This will allow you to switch between the various 
                 characters within you party.  This can only be used 
                 at save-point flags and at the 3d land map mode. 
      
            o--> Note that you must first have MORE than 3 characters 
                 within your party in order to use the PHS.

   #10. [ Save ]: This will allow you to save your game. (duh)
                  You can only save your game at save-point flags and 
                  at the 3d land map mode.

o---[ CHOCOBO : Feeding Effects ]

    In the course of breeding/developing your own chocobo, 
    it is important to know the type of plant food you feed it with.
    Each chocobo has various optimum levels in defining its speed, 
    stamina, and agility - use the chart below to guide you in 1
    increasing your chocobo's various abilities...

       PLANT TYPE   | SPEED | STAMINA | AGILITY

o----[ CHOCOBO : Breeding Special Chocobo ]
     
     Breeding these "special" chocobo are only necessary in order to 
     access the various secret/hidden islands & caves that require 
     chocobos that have the special ability to travel through rivers, 
     or mountains, or ocean, or even all three combined.
     Below is a chart of breeding the 4 specific special chocobo...

 CHOCOBO  |  COLOR  |      BREEDING COMBINATION       | BREEDING FOOD 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mountain | Green   |    "sugoku ee" + "sugoku ee"    | Karabu 
          |         | or "ee" + "ee"                  |  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 River    | Blue    |    "sugoku ee" + "sugoke ee"    | Karabu
          |         | or "ee" + "ee"                  | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mountain | Black   | Mountain Chocobo +              | Karabu 
+River    |         | River Chocobo                   |  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ocean    | Gold    |(Mountain + River) Chocobo       | Zeio
          |         | + "Sugoku ee"                   | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The "breeding combination" refers to the status of the chocobo.
      Upon catching a chocobo, you can talk to Gren-Gren at the 
      Chocobo Farm to find out the status of that chocobo.  
    
NOTE: When combining 2 chocobos, remember that you need to have 
      "osu" (male) and "mesu" (female) chocobos in order to breed 
      the new chocobo. (Duh)

NOTE: For other reference information on chocobo breeding, 
      here is a recommended web site for detailed chocobo info:
      [ http://www.phonet.com/~crow/ff7/import/chocobo/guide.html ]


o----[ "Chocobo'kuru" Attack : "Learning" Procedure ]
 
  - NOTE: You must have the "Tekino Waza" (Enemy's Ability) materia
          orb equipted on your character prior to proceeding. 
  
  (1) Find/encounter a chocobo at level 16 or 36 (level in increment of 4)
      You can find out the level of a chocobo by using the "Miyaburu" 
      (scan) materia orb.

  (2) During the battle, give the chocobo the "Mimetto" plant food to 
      insure that it will not run away. 

  (3) Cast the "Lv4 Jibaku" (one of the "tekino waza ability" spells)
      onto the chocobo.

  (4) After casting the "Lv4 Jibaku" spell a few times, the chocobo 
      will counterattack with the "Chocobo'kuru" attack.          
  
  (5) Now you will have learned the "Chocobo'kuru" attack ability! (^o^)


o----[ Obtaining the "Master Mahoo" Materia ]

  - In order to obtain the "Master Mahoo" materia orb, you will need
    to first master the 21 other materia orbs prior to proceeding.

  - Here are the 21 materia orbs you must first master:

    (1) "Kaifuku"         (11) "Fuugiru"       (21) "Ultima"
    (2) "Chiryu"          (12) "Henshin"
    (3) "Sosei"           (13) "Jikan"
    (4) "Hanou"           (14) "Barrier"
    (5) "Reiki"           (15) "Shoometsu"
    (6) "Ikazuchi"        (16) "Ridatsu"
    (7) "Daichi"          (17) "Inseki"
    (8) "Doku"            (18) "Fuuin"
    (9) "Jyuryoku"        (19) "Full care"
   (10) "Madowasu"        (20) "Shield"
                         
  - Upon mastering all the levels for each of these 21 materia orbs, 
    go to the Cosmo Canyon and head to the astronomy room, where the 
    4 "huge materia" are.  
 
  - You will then obtain the "Master Mahoo" (master magic) materia orb!


o----[ "Ultima Weapon" ]

 - Towards the end of 2nd CD through 3rd CD, you will encounter and 
   battle against the "weapon" from time to time.  

 - Eventually, after many confrontations with the "weapon", you will
   defeat it and receive the "Ultima Weapon" for Cloud!  (^o^)


o----[ "All 7 Fever" : 7777 Hp Damage per hit! ]

  - This is a temporary status of any one of your characters
    whose hit point attribute values at exactly 7777.
    If & when your character(s) are under the "All 7 Fever"
    status, that character(s) will automatically engage
    in a berzerk-like mode, instantly attacking the enemy
    repeatedly until it has perished, inflicting 7777 damage
    points for every hit.  In short, the "all 7 fever" status
    will elliminate the enemy regardless whether if it is a
    dark dragon w/5,000 hps or a boss character w/100,000 hps.
    Its potential collective damage is infinate.|
    However, once the battle round is over, that character's
    hit points will be depleated to 1 hit point and needs
    healing immediately.

    Once healed back to 7777, the "all 7 fever" is once more
    initiated in the next encountered battle sequence, and     
    the process is repeated.
	
    NOTE that this status is in fact TEMPORARY, as once that
    character gains that next level upgrade, the total hit point
    attribute is altered, and so consequently - no more "all 7 fever"...


o----[ Tip on getting more Gil & GP ] (submitted by Tatsushi Nakao)
 
   - Need more money? 
     Try selling a zentaika materia orb (at "mastered" level)
     for 1,400,000 Gil.  

   - Need more GP?
     Sometimes, there is a person standing in front of the house at 
     entrance of Gold Saucer.  He will sell GP for Gil - you can buy 
     maximum of 100 GP for 10,000 Gil.  Try going in & out of the 
     Gold Saucer until he shows up.
