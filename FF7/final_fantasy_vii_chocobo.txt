                  Interested in getting updated versions of this
                  GREAT Faq? Just drop me a line at:
                  RidgeRacer@goplay.com 
                  
                  I would also like to thank everybody (listed above)
                  who took their time to help me with Chocobo breeding
                  and help with FFVII. 
 
                  Most of this comes from Choco Billy himself, and I
                  have made it clearer by subsituting some things. So,
                  for instance, if you hear breeding Black Chocobos
                  takes years, it actually doesn't. I have added A LOT
                  on my own, so this isn't a rip off or anything.
                  So, in other words, lots of this is basically a
                  story line, with a lot of info. Well, you know what
                  I mean..I hope.

(1.) WHAT ARE CHOCOBOS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chocobos are fun-loving creatures with gentle demeanors. When properly trained, 
they can become pets, help with industrial projects, or act as transportation. 
You can often find them in the wild, normally around grassy plains. Just look 
for their tracks.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(2.) HOW CAN I GET A CHOCOBO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because of their friendly demeanor, you can easily capture them in the wild. 
However, you'll need some special bait to help lure them out of hiding. Choco 
Bill's Chocobo Ranch is pleased to announce that they've purchased a limited 
quantity of Chocobo Lure Materia that we'll be selling at a special price. With 
this Materia in hand, you should have no trouble locating a Chocobo. Just 
remember to be nice to you bird or it may run off or turn violent. You can also 
coax Chocobos into sticking around longer by feeding them Greens.

Note: When you first visit the ranch, early in the game, "talk" to one of the 
Chocobos, and if you give the right response, it will do a little dance and 
you'll recieve the Chocobo Lure Materia FREE!

Note: You NEED the Chocobo Lure Materia to even see a Chocobo while wandering 
their tracks.. MAKE SURE to get this.

Note: I've found that Tantal Greens work the best for keeping a Chocobo busy 
during battle (and not running), they're also only 400 gil.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(3.) WHAT DO I DO ONCE I GET A CHOCOBO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can ridge your Chocobo anywhere you see fit. Chocobos can travel across land 
but can't cross water or mountains without the aid of a man-made path (unless 
you have a green, blue, black, or gold one..). While traveling on your Chocobo, 
you can avoid encounters with any sort of nasty creatures that might be lurking 
nearby. Just remember this: Once you dismount, you Chocobo will hightail it back 
to its homelands (unless you own a stable).

Looking for something a little more permanent? Choco Bill's Chocobo Ranch can 
rent you up to six Chocobo stalls for the low, low price of 10,000 Gil each. All 
you need to do is capture the Chocobos and feeding them as you see fit.

Note: I had this problem knowing how to "dismount" at first. If you DO NOT own a 
stall, then your Chocobo will just run away. If you OWN a stall, you'll have the 
option of sending it back to the ranch, or letting it free. If you riding one of 
YOUR CHOCOBOS that you got from the ranch, you just dismount, and it'll stay 
there.
If you choose to ride one of YOUR Chocobos, you can get it to other lands by 
press Circle on the Airship (Highwind) while on your Chocobo.

The ranchers children and farmhands, Choco Billy and Chole, handle the day-to-
day chores involved in raising these fun-loving birds. Billy handles the sales 
of the nuts and greens, which are essential items when breeding a top-class 
Chocobo. He also helps manage the feeding and tracking of your Chocobo. Chole 
helps you keep track of any additional information you might pick up regarding 
Chocobo breeding. She also has quite a knack for judging and comparing the 
abilites of all the Chocobos in the stable area.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(4.) WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After renting a stable or two, it's time to go Chocobo hunting. Equip the 
Chocobo Lure Materia and find some Chocobo tracks. After capturing a Chocobo, 
you're given the option to send it back to the stables (as you dismount). If you 
choose to do so, Chocobo Billy will keep your new bird in the pen outside the 
stables until you have a chance to better inspect it. Each pen can hold up to 
four Chocobos at a time, so make sure you capture your limit before returning to 
the ranch.

Note: Make sure to have AT LEAST three rented stable (30,000 gil) if you are 
planning on mating them.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(5.) WHERE SHOULD I HUNT FOR A CHOCOBO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well if you'd like there are plenty of wild Chocobo's that roam the prairies 
around the Chocobo ranch. They're easy to capture but not always of the highest 
quality. To get really good birds, you'll have to travel to pretty exotic lands 
and withstand some harsh climates. Beginners may find it a bit of a bother at 
first, but it's worth it. Chocobos are like any other kind of animal. Where life 
is easy, like the plains surrounding the Chocobo Ranch, the Chocobos grow up to 
be a little lazy and weak. In a dangerous climate like the polar cap, Chocobos 
typically either don't make it or they grow up to be extremely tough. That's why 
it's worth the trek to those far off lands. Over the years the ranch has 
collected a lot of information on the various places Chocobos can be found.

You may find the world's best Chocobos inside Choco Bill's Chocobo Ranch, but 
the plains surrounding the ranch are a poor hunting ground. There are lots of 
Chocobos to be had, but most are lazy and slow. The weather is too perfect, 
Greens are abundant, and the Chocobos really don't have any natural enemies in 
the area. Heck... someday you may even see a wild Chocobo running happily along 
side a pack of Levrikon.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(6.) HOW DO I KNOW A GOOD CHOCOBO FROM A BAD ONE?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After moving your Chocobos from the pen to the stables, Bill will give you an 
assessment of the birds. There are several types of Chocobos, some which you'll 
want to avoid. These are the types:

Chocobo Types                 Choco Billy's Assessments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Wonderful                   "This...is a wonderful Chocobo!"
Great                         "This is a great Chocobo."
*                             "Mmm, this seems like a good Chocobo."
Good                          "Mmm, this one's not bad."
Average                       "This is a pretty average Chocobo."
##Poor                        "This one doesn't seem to be very good."
##Weak                        "I can't recommend this one."

A Chocobo's initial "type" determines its future speed, intelligence, and 
stamina limitations. Because breeding Chocobos isn't cheap, you'll never want to 
start with anything LESS than a Great Chocobo.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(7.) I HAVE A CHOCOBO, NOW WHAT DO I DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now you'll want to feed and train your Chocobo to make it the best that it can 
be. Feeding Greens to your Chocobo will raise its statistics, plus it increases 
the Chocobo's fondness for you. You can also train your Chocobo by racing it at 
the Gold Saucer, which helps ensure that your Chocobo's offspring turn out to be 
champions.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(8.) WHY SHOULD I RACE MY CHOCOBOS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Racing Chocobos helps them pass along their statistics to their offspring. Two 
untrained Chocobos will give birth to a much weaker baby than two champions 
will. This makes it essential that you train your Chocobos hard before breeding 
them.

How do I race, you ask? When you arrive at the Gold Saucer, speak with Ester at 
the Chocobo Racing forum. You can register the Chocobo of your choice for the 
next race in the chosen Chocobo's class. There are four Chocobo classes. Class C 
is the slowest class. Class B is a little faster than Class C, but is still easy 
to beat. Class A is the toughest of the normal classes, but a "Great" Chocobo 
can easily trounce the competition. The final class is the S Class. Only world-
class Chocobos make it this far.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(9.) HOW DO I WIN?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experienced Chocobo jockeys know that speed isn't everything. A Chocobo with a 
high amount of stamina can easily outrun one with better top speed. The Chocobo 
with stamina can be pushed harder for a longer period of time, which easily 
makes up for the difference in speed. Also, it's not a good idea to let your 
Chocobos race for themselves. Sure, you can get away with it in the lower 
classes, but not in an S Class race. Look for special Chocobos, ones that can 
breeze through the course without panicking at the sight of water or twisting 
hills.

One of the top riders goes by the name of Teioh. His rare Black Chocobo is 
extremely fast and has an incredible amount of stamina. Don't be surprised if he 
grinds you to a pulp the first few times you race him. He deserves mentioning 
because of his ride. Black Chocobos are a product of years of breeding. 
Unfortunately, the secret of breeding a Black Chocobo was lost years ago, but 
I'm sure there's someone out there that still might know.

Note: Most of this "storyline" was taking from the rancher. Don't be discouraged 
about the Black Chocobo. It doesn't really take years, it's a game everyone. You 
could do it in five seconds.. if you had the right stuff. 
And, I have the "secret" to breeding a Black Chocobo right here, in this FAQ.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(10.) I'VE GOT A CHAMPION, SO WHAT'S NEXT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you have several championship quality Chocobos, it's time to start 
breeding them to acquire an even better Chocobo. When you're interested in doing 
so, I can guide you through the steps. First, make sure you have an empty stall 
in the stable because the little one needs a place to sleep, you know. Also, 
make sure you have two eligible Chocobos, which means a male and a female that 
have both had time to mature and haven't mated recently. Choco Billy will check 
to make sure everything is in order, and then he'll ask you to choose a nut. If 
you don't own any nuts, Choco Billy has a selection that can be purchased for 
breeding purposes. This selection includes:
Pepio Nut    - 100 Gil
Luchile Nut  - 200 Gil
Saraha Nut   - 400 Gil
Lasan Nut    - 600 Gil

Note: Nuts can also be stolen from enemies and bought from other places..

Nuts help determine what kind the baby will resemble. Obviously, the better the 
nut, the more likely the baby will be stronger than its parents. Some nuts can 
produce a completely unique type of Chocobo. This may be how Teioh acuired his 
Black Chocobo. Anyway, keep your eyes open for any unique nuts you may find 
while traveling around the world. They just might prove to come in handy.

What else should you know? At one time, there were two now extinct types of 
Chocobo roaming the planet: The Mountain-Chocobo and the River-Chocobo. The 
Mountain-Chocobo was a green tinted bird with the ability to cross mountains. 
The River-Chocobo was a blue bird that could cross any shallow body of water. 
Remember that there are some parts of this planet that just can't be reached by 
conventional means. On the other hand, the right kind of Chocobo can cross 
anything.

Long ago, there was a guy named Chocobo Sage. If you can find him, I'm sure he 
could tell you all about breeding Mountain- or River-Chocobos. He may even be 
able to tell you about the Black Chocobo. If you do find him, let Choco Billy's 
daughter, Chole, know and she'll keep track of any information he may give you.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(11.) CHOCOBO SAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the mountains deep within the arctic continent, you'll find a small house 
with a strange man named Chocobo Sage. He has advice on how to raise the Green, 
Blue, Black, and Gold Chocobos. You can also pick up an "Enemy Skill" Materia 
just for stoppind by and speaking with his pet Chocbo.

There's also stuff to buy at the Chocobo Sage's house. Here you'll find the 
conveted Sylkis Greens as wll as several other Chocobo related items:
Porov Nut      -  2000 Gil
Pram Nut       -  1500 Gil
Sylkis Greens  -  5000 Gil
Reagan Greens  -  3000 Gil

Note: If anyone knows how to get the sage to "spill his guts", let me know. 
What's the secret to getting him to talk? Every once and a while he will, and 
every once and a while "he can't remember".

(12.) GREENS GUIDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Green           Price (Gil)     +Speed       +Intellect      +Stamina
^^^^^           ^^^^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^
Gysahl          100              No           No              Yes
Krakka          250              No           Yes             No
Tantal          400              Yes          Yes             Yes
Pahsana         800              No           Yes             No
Curiel          1000             Yes          No              Yes
Mimett          1500             Yes          No              Yes
Reagan          3000             ???          ???             ???
Sylkis          5000             ???          ???             ???

Note: I know either the Reagan or Sylkis give you a "Yes" in all three 
catagories, I just can't remember. I will have both of them done in the next 
version.

Note: I usually use the TANTAL green, it has a "Yes" in all three catagories. 
Sure, it may not boost the speed as much as say, the CURIEL green would, but I 
get three "Yes"'s. Plus, it's fairly cheap too!

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(13.) RAISING A BLUE CHOCOBO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This type of Chocobo cannot be caught. It must be breed at the Chocobo Ranch. In 
order to breed this Chocobo, you need a Yellow GREAT Chocobo male or female, and 
a Yellow OKAY Chocobo of the other sex. You must also have the Carob Nut, which 
is stollen from a monster that you encounter just south of bone village (on the 
same continent, just directly south of the village, in the grassy plains). The 
monster is called "Vlakorados", which has a fairly decent amount of HP. By 
breeding the Male GREAT Chocobo with the OK Female Chocobo (with the Carob Nut), 
you get either the blue or green Chocobo, and by doing the opposite, a Male OK 
Chocobo with a Female GREAT chocobo, you get the other.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(14.) RAISING A GREEN CHOCOBO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is EXACTLY the same as breeding a BLUE Chocobo. See above!

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(15.) RAISING A BLACK CHOCOBO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to get the Black Chocobo, you need to breed a Green Chocobo with a Blue 
Chocobo (male and a female) by using a Carob Nut (the same Nut used to breed a 
Green and Blue Chocobo).

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
(16.) RAISING A GOLD CHOCOBO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to get the Gold Chocobo, you need to breed a Black Chocobo with an S-
Class Chocobo using the Zeio Nut which is found on the island with the forest in 
the Top Right part of the world map. To get the Zeio Nut, you need to find a 
Goblin (in the Top Right part of the map, in the forest area) and steal one from 
them. Goblins are EASY to beat.. trust me.

Note: You can also get a Gold Chocobo by defeating the RUBY WEAPON (in the 
desert area near the Gold Saucer on DISC 3), and trading the item you get from 
it (Desert Rose) for a Gold Chocobo from the Kalm Traveler.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

Well, that's the end of the FFVII CHOCOBO BREEDING FAQ. I hope you enjoyed it, 
and it helped you.

Your probably asking yourself, "What's the big deal with a GOLD CHOCOBO, why 
would I want one?"
Well, once you get one, you can go ANYWHERE on the world map, including secret 
materia caves. In one, you'll find the AWESOME Summon Materia, "Knights Of The 
Round" which can cause 70,000+ damage on a/an enemy(s) with one cast!
