
Fort Condor Notes
Version 0.1
Last Edited 11/30/99

********************

Well, I wanted to know some stuff about the Fort Condor battles but
couldn't find what I wanted to know online.  So I did some
experimentation and figured I'd share the results with anyone who
cares.  Props to Kao Megura (his FAQ is right beside me whenever I
play FF7) and to Joe Winiarski (I don't use this one quite as
extensively, but it helps).  Also, thanks to ____________ whose
webpage suggested rushing down the mountain (which I have found to be
a superior strategy thus far).

Notes: I've only beaten Disc One so far, so maybe not everything holds
in other discs.  Also, I've only played the US version for PC.

Please email me at skhirosh@mit.edu with any corrections/additions.  Thanks.

                            When fighting against this enemy unit
                               Damage Done/Damage Taken by you
Allied Unit   Cost   HPs   Beast   Wyvern   Barbarian   Commander
-----------   ----   ---   -----   ------   ---------   ---------
Attacker       420   180   40/15    22/25     17/30       12/60
Shooter        520   160   10/45    30/12     16/20        6/60
Stoner         480   100   20/30     6/25     16/20       10/60
Catapult       480   100   18/30    14/25     14/20        9/60
Fighter        400   200   30/30    27/25     30/20       15/60
Defender       440   220   35/30    24/37     52/10       17/60
Tristoner     1000   150   30/30     9/25     24/20       15/60
Fire Cat.      600   120   25/30    20/25     20/20       12/60
Repairer       480   160   10/30     9/25     10/20        5/60
Worker         400   160   15/30    13/25     15/20        7/60
(Bomb)         ---   ---   15/--    13/--     15/--        7/--

So, when I send my Attacker against a Beast, I hit the Beast for 40 HP
and he hits me for 15 HP.  Clearly, I am winning out.

Enemy Unit   HPs
----------   ---
Beast        230
Wyvern       190
Barbarian    180
Commander    250

Also, your mobile units get their turn before the enemy units.  So,
I kill the Beast with my 6th attack before he can make his 6th attack.

********************

Other notes:

The battle ends as soon as there are no more enemies on the mountain.
You don't have to wait for and defeat the enemy commander (I thought
this was the case for a long time).  So, beat down the enemy quickly
before more bad guys can appear.

Stationary allied units (Stoners, Tristoners, Catapults, and Fire
Catapults) get destroyed very quickly by the enemy (they get maybe 3
attacks for your 1).  So, if a Beast gets to a Catapult, the Catapult
is pretty much toast.

Stationary allied units can hit multiple opponents.  They just have to
be all in the area of effect when the bomb/rock gets there.

Workers can't lay a new bomb until the first one has detonated.

Barbarians have a ranged attack, so they can get in a shot as you are
moving in on them.

Shooters have a ranged attack, so you can get in a shot on opponents
as they move in on you.

Repairers have a really slow rate of healing.  They only heal 10 hp, also.

Ganging up on a bad guy is beneficial for you.  Being ganged up on is
bad for you.

The Wyverns are fast.  The Commander is slow.

Attackers are fast.  Shooters are slow.

Items won from the battles (this is the info I set out to find):

Battle            Prize            When can I fight the nth battle?
---------------   --------------   --------------------------------------------
First Battle:     Magic Comb       Before fighting Bottomswell in Junon
Second Battle:    Peace Ring       After fighting Bottomswell in Junon
Third Battle:     ???              I can't find anyway to get back for this one
Fourth Battle:    3 Tinctures *    After you get the buggy
Fifth Battle:     Megalixir        After beating Cave of the Gi
Sixth Battle:     5 Potions        After getting Tiny Bronco
Seventh Battle:   Superball        After Date, before Temple
Eighth Battle:    3 Turbo Ethers   After beating Temple of the Ancients
Ninth Battle:     3 Turbo Ethers   After Aeris dies, before following Sephiroth

* Tinctures are items from FF6.  What you really get is 3 Ethers.

Money can't buy Turbo Ethers, but here you get 3 for the price of 2
Attackers, 2 Defenders, and 2 Shooters.  The first six guys up the mountain
during these battles are 2 Wyverns, 2 Barbarians, and 2 Beasts.  If you rush
down the mountain, you can whip them before anyone else shows up.

Note that if the enemy commander makes it to the shed and you have to fight
the CMD. Grand Horn, you don't get the prize.

Things I'd like to know (if someone has time and/or desire to research them):

     1) If I skip a battle (let's say #7) does the next battle give me
        the 3 Turbo Ethers or the Superball?
     2) Is there a (non-cheating) way to get back for battle #3?
     3) What is the prize for the missing battle?  (Can somebody with
        a cheat code help me out here?)

That's it.  Thanks for reading!
