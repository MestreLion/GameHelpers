A quick note from KM:

Hello!  No, this isn't another update, it's more like a quick addition
I'm putting here so that everyone will notice it.  I'm asking that you
guys DON'T E-MAIL ME ABOUT FF7 QUESTIONS anymore.  I've answered so
many e-mails I can't possibly count them all, and even though I stopped
the US FF7 FAQ back in January, people still e-mail me constantly, and
I don't have the time to answer it all.  If you want to use my FF7 FAQ
on a web page, go ahead.  If you want to use this FAQ in any other way
(such as in a publication or there is some sort of legal or credit
issue,) then you MUST contact me first, but otherwise, that's it!  You
can't please everyone, which is a big reason why the FAQ won't be
updated anymore!

I'm not trying to be rude, but it gets a little tiring at times.  I
realize that there are some mistakes still in the FAQ that I never got
around to correcting (the Emerald Weapon does damage equal to the
materia that you wear, there is no use for the miniature soldiers, you
cannot have chocobos that can fly, and any character who isn't in Disc
2 or 3 cannot be used without a GameShark code, and Bahamut Zero can be
gotten from Cosmo Canyon, this is in the FAQ but no one notices [ditto
with info. on how to get the Underwater Materia in the US version!]),
but I've done this thing for more than a year now and I'm tired of FF7,
geez!  Besides, those of you who keep up on the legal side of things
know that I have other reasons for not wanting to continue the FAQ....
Anyway, if you _do_ send me a question, your mail will be erased!  I
hate to end the FAQ on this sort of note, but that's how it is.

(Please note that this is the last revision of the Japanese FF7 FAQ.
If you own a US copy of FF7, I have an English FAQ that you can find
at most Final Fantasy-related sites, including my own homepage at:
<http://www.fortunecity.com/bally/orange/25/>.  I've had a lot of
fun working on this guide and I appreciate everyone who contributed,
but at this point, there's not much of a reason to continue this
version of the FAQ now that the English release of FF7 is available.)

This FAQ is divided into two parts:

The Complete Walkthrough    - The file you're currently reading.  It
                              contains a guide for the entire game, and
                              has information on how to play the game.

Extra Stuff You Should Know - You're not reading this one.  This file
                              focuses on secrets in the game.  In
                              addition it has extensive lists of materia
                              orbs, limit breaks, monsters and
                              speculation concerning FF7 rumors.

Both of these files can be found at the 'main' address (cgfm2's homepage)
Other sites that carry this FAQ may not have both files, or may have
older versions of the FAQ (it was just one file until v1.6).  If you're
asking why I split up this FAQ, it's because it was too big for me to
edit on my computer.... ^_^;  Both parts will be updated under the same
revision number--you can find out which file was updated by looking
under the 'Revision History' section.  Some sections can be found in
both files, simply for ease of use and to create a more uniform
appearance.

                           1. REVISION HISTORY
                          +++++++++++++++++++++

VERSION 2.2  (November 12, 1997)
Minor corrections and URL changes.  Just a reminder that this is
the last revision of the FAQ, and that you should download my US
FF7 FAQ if you need help in the game.

VERSION 2.1  (August 19, 1997)
Stuck the disclaimer back in part 1 of the FAQ, and made a few
touch-ups.

VERSION 2.0  (August 10, 1997)
More minor corrections.  I think now I have everything covered :)

VERSION 1.8  (August 8, 1997)
Added information Yuffie stealing 'disabled' materia, and made
various corrections I forgot to add to v1.7 ^_^;

VERSION 1.7  (August 4, 1997)
The Disc Two and Three Walkthroughs have been entirely re-written,
and are now in English.  In addition, the Monster List has been
updated.  More corrections have been made as well, in addition to
extra information about the sub-quests, the URA battle, and more.

The FF7 FAQ is more or less complete at this point (I didn't think
I'd be saying that for a _long_ time).  There are still some minor
things to be fixed/added here and there, but this is the last major
revision that I'll be making.

VERSION 1.6x  (July 10, 1997)
A mini-update, I guess.  Everything in the Disc 1 Walkthrough is now
in English, and the Translations and Shopping List sections have been
updated.  Two new sections, Ultimate Weapons and Items and Equipment,
have also been added, in addition to the various usual minor fixes.
The 'Rumors and Speculation' section has also been updated.

VERSION 1.6  (June 20, 1997)
Finished the Materia List and revamped the 'Rumors and Speculation'
section.  Changed the order of some sections and updated lots of
other stuff, including the Translation section.  The Disc One
walkthrough is now completely rewritten--Disc Two should be done
by the next revision or so.  Also added the initial release of the
monster list.  If you haven't noticed, the FAQ has been split into
two files, too.  Also updated the 'Earn Lots of AP' Game Shark code.

VERSION 1.5x  (June 1, 1997)
Added the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code, in addition to some info.
about the hidden (or at least undocumented) Materia Orbs; you may want
to take a look at the 'Underwater Breath' materia.  Also updated the
Rumors and Speculation section, Materia List and added all remaining
master AP scores for the Materia Orbs.

VERSION 1.5  (May 31, 1997)
Added the 'Item Select' Game Shark code!  Fixed up minor changes made
in later releases of v1.4 so everything is up to date at this point.
Also added master AP scores for most of the materia in the Materia List.

VERSION 1.4  (May 29, 1997)
New sections have been added: 'Shopping List' (to make help with
purchases), 'Learning Limit Breaks' (self-explanatory), and
'Translations' (a list of items, etc. and their translated names).
Several sections have also been updated (like the Enemy Skills List
and Materia list).  I am currently re-playing the game to fix
mistakes and clear up any poorly written sections; Disc 1 is a
little over half complete and I will work on the other discs soon.
As usual, more corrections and updates have been made (especially
for my translations :)).  I've added some Game Shark codes that
were submitted to me in the 'Secrets and Strategies' section, as
well as more info on the FMV Viewing Trick.  Finally, the disclaimer
has been tweaked a little (hopefully for the last time :)).

VERSION 1.3  (May 6, 1997)
Updated the Enemy Skills List, Materia List, and Raising Chocobos
sections.  Added information on other Bonus Areas and Cosmo Canyon.
Added the 'Kamedouraku Flyers' and 'All 7 Fever' tricks, as well
as the 'Infinite Limit Break Use' and 'Start with Gold Chocobo' Game
Shark codes.  There's also a new section, the Limit Break List.
General updates and corrections have been made throughout the FAQ.
Now that I have many of the 'correct' names for the items, locations,
etc., most of the names in this FAQ have been changed.  The disclaimer
has also been changed somewhat.

Keep an eye out for a complete listing of monsters and their abilities;
the initial release will be added to this FAQ in an upcoming revision
or be released separately.

VERSION 1.2  (April 20, 1997)
Complete overhaul of the Enemy Skills list.  How to get the Bahamut
Zero materia, info. on red sub and events at Cosmo Canyon added.  New
ASCII title, and a new URL added (for those of you who want to
understand this game's storyline).

VERSION 1.1  (April 14, 1997)
Added the FMV Viewing Trick to the 'Secrets and Strategies' section.

VERSION 1.0  (April 12, 1997)
The Disc Three walkthrough is done, making this version the 'official'
release (since it now guides you through the whole game).  Added the
'Piano Trick', explained how to get the Alexander Materia and how to
reach the lower chest in the east wing of Sephiroth's Mansion.
Altered the Introduction and Revision History sections a bit, and
updated the Enemy Skill List and Materia Orbs sections.  Also added
how to get back into Midgar City.

VERSION 0.4x  (April 7, 1997)
Various corrections/updates, among them the 'Character Select' code
and info. on the Sleeping Man, as well as the monster in section 4a.

VERSION 0.4  (April 6, 1997)
The walkthrough for Disc Two is complete!  This FAQ now provides a
complete guide for both Disc 1 and 2 at this point.  The guide for
Disc 3 is currently underway.

VERSION 0.3  (April 5, 1997)
Began work on Enemy Skill and Summon Materia charts.  Fixed up some
misc. info. and other things in the FAQ, and added the Mini-Battle
game strategy to the 'Having Fun' section.  Added 'Body Heat' Game
Shark code, and more information concerning the 'Character Select'
code.

VERSION 0.2  (March 31, 1997)
Fixed information on the 'bug' Materia (it's actually Techniques of
the Enemy).  Added the 'Character Select' Game Shark code, which
among other things, lets you play with Aerith AFTER Disc One or even
use Sephiroth!  The Disc Two Walkthrough has just been started and
will be added in good time.

VERSION 0.1  (March 28, 1997)
First release.  Bare-bones walkthrough for Disc One and other basic
information.  Still more to add and correct.  Contains the 'No Time
Limit' Game Shark code.

Began construction of VERSION 0.0 on February 14th, 1997.


                            +++++++++++++++++
                             2. INTRODUCTION
                            +++++++++++++++++

"The town of Midgar is under the tight grip of Shin-Ra, the infamous
conglomerate.  The Shin-Ra Electric Power Company has been exploiting the
life force of the planet, destroying its' precious nature.
Meanwhile, the underground rebel force with a mission, Avalanche, managed
to blow up Makon Furnace No. 1.  Their goal is to destroy Shin-Ra and
stop their atrocities.  It turned out that Cloud, one of the former
Shin-Ra soldiers, helped the explosion.
Can just a handful of brave soldiers save the life of the planet?
Shin-Ra is much too big an enemy to fight against.

THE FATE OF THE PLANET IS ON THIS BATTLE."

So begins Final Fantasy VII's saga, set in a futuristic world where swords
and sorcery are combined with guns and machinery.  This FAQ is designed to
guide people through the game, providing not only a walkthrough for the
adventures contained on each disc but also information on basic gameplay,
secrets and tricks, and more.

This FAQ is based entirely on the Japanese version of FF7.  Therefore,
some things in this guide may not apply to the English version of FF7 when
it is released (presumably on September 7th, 1997).  Furthermore, as the
writer of this FAQ neither speaks nor understands Japanese, this guide is
not 100% accurate.  Although mistakes will be corrected in future
revisions as soon as they are noticed, some parts of this guide are bound
to be unclear on the subject or run the risk of supplying false info.

Any Japanese names that you come across have either been submitted to me
by someone else or I have translated them using a kana chart (and since I
don't know the first thing about the Japanese language, my translations
may not be correct).  Now that I am doing item and name translations,
(as of v1.3 onwards) this is more true than ever.  If you see a
translated name and would like to know the English equivalent, (assuming
there is one) then please refer to the 'Translations' section for details.

Whenever possible, I'll write NSS (Not So Sure) after anything that may
be incorrect or unconfirmable.  Furthermore, the I'll try to provide
names of monsters, cities, locations, etc. when possible, but many things
may be referred to as 'the big brown hut', 'the four-armed red frog
monster', etc. because I don't know the exact name.  This FAQ tries to be
as understandable and clear as possible, but this is not always the case.

Due to the size of this game, the FF7 FAQ will be revised whenever it is
necessary, and can be found at:

                www.fortunecity.com/bally/orange/25/

You can find revisions elsewhere (look at the top of the FAQ).  While I
update the FAQ whenever I have the spare time, I can't guarantee that
other places will have the latest revision.


                       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                        3. WALKTHROUGH - DISC ONE
                       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(Note that the beginning of this game has been altered somewhat from the
FF7 demo disc packaged with Tobal No. 1 and other FF7 demos.)


=========================================================================
a.  MAKORO POWER PLANT
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion x3, Phoenix Tail, Recovery materia,
                     Assault Gun.

At the start of the game, you'll have 3 Potions, a Phoenix Tail, and an
Ether.  You can't equip Materia until you reach section 3b, by the way.

Once you leave the train, check the body of the closest guard twice to
get two Potions.  Then head north.  You'll be attacked by some guards.
Take them out with your sword (you may win a Potion for killing them)
and then move left to go outside.  Now, talk to your teammates (Biggs,
Wedge, and Jesse), then name yourself and Barett.  Make your way to the
northwestern door, and head up in the next room to enter the heart of
the power plant.

Talk to Barett, (who joins you) and then talk to each Avalanche member
to open the doors.  After opening the second door, head right to enter
another chamber with a treasure chest (Phoenix Tail).  Then, go back
and enter the elevator (you'll have to talk to Jesse first).  Press the
arrow switch to activate it.

Work your way down to stairs and go through the door to the left.  Then
follow Jesse down the ladder.  When he stops, search the area in front
of him for a Potion (it's hard to see because of the steam).  Climb
down the cross the pipes, descend the nearby ladder, and take note of
the Save Point before heading down the walkway.

Pick up the Recovery materia on the ground in the next area and set the
bomb.  An alarm will sound and you'll have to fight the boss, a huge
scorpion-like machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: GAADOSUKOOPION  (Guard Scorpion)        LV: ??  HP: 800  MP: 0

Cloud's Sandaa magic works well.  Don't worry about the boss' infinity-
symbol-shaped ray and have Barett attack.  When you've done enough
damage, the boss will start to shake and Cloud will talk to Barett.  From
this point onward, don't attack the boss and heal yourself or simply
guard until the boss attacks you.  If you try to hurt it during this
time, the boss responds with a damaging laser ray shot from his tail.  A
few more hits after it stops shaking and the boss dies.  You'll get an
Assault Gun when you kill it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You now have ten minutes to escape from the power plant.  You'll need
to make your way back to the upside-down T-shaped entrance hall where
one of the Avalanche members is waiting.  (If you've played the demo
disc, know that you don't need to 'search' for the other members; just
talk to the one member waiting for you at the top of the stairs and
ladders to make him jump over you and then get out.  Since Barett gets
a new gun after the battle, be sure to equip it.  Also, talk to the
other members to open the two doors on your way back.


=========================================================================
b.   MIDGAR CITY
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion.

After the Avalanche members blow up the passage, head up the stairs.
You'll meet Aerith here, but she won't join you yet.  Since Barett's
gone, you'll have to fight the enemies here alone.  There's a Potion.
to the southwest of the circular structure (near the lampposts).  Walk
south.  In this next part, you'll meet up with guards and have the
choice of running (bottom choice) or fighting (top choice).  After a
few more encounters, Cloud'll jump onto the passing train and run into
the Avalanche gang.  After talking to them, walk to the 'front' of the
screen and you'll jump off into another area.  Talk to the people here
and one of the members (Jesse) will show you a picture of the Makoro
plant on the train's screen.  Approach Barett and you'll end up going
to the group's base.


=========================================================================
c.  AVALANCHE BASE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  1500 gil, Affect All materia, Ether.

Head west and go upwards.  Talk to the kid by the fence, then head west
again (there's a Save Point nearby, too).  Talk to the people here,
then check out the bar.  At the top of the tallest building in the south-
east is a bedroom.  The kid here will let you spend the night for 10 gil.

In the bar, you'll meet Tifa, who is also a member of Avalanche, as well
as Marin, who is supposedly Barett's daughter.  After naming Tifa, Barett
shows up when you try to leave and reveals the hidden base underneath the
bar.  Talk to Tifa, and then when you meet Barett the next morning, he'll
give you 1500 gil.  You'll also find that there is another Save Point in
the second floor of the tall building, inside the huge cage.  The man in
the right corner of this room has a Materia by his feet (Affect All).
Take it and a chest will drop down that has an Ether inside of it.  You
can learn about the game's mechanics from the people in here (if you know
Japanese, that is :))  If you check the Main Menu, you'll see that you
can use Materia at this point, and that Tifa has joined your party.  In
addition, the two buildings that were locked the other day are now open.

When you're ready, go back to the train station to prepare for
Avalanche's next mission.  If you like, you can go to the far right to
enter a train yard, but there's not much of interest there.


=========================================================================
d.  RETURN TO THE MAKORO PLANT
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether x2, Potion, Tent, Titanium Bangle.

Board the train.  When the timer appears after you talk to Tifa, go
through each train car until Tifa jumps off one of the cars and you and
Barett follow her.  You'll end up in an underground railroad passageway.
If you go south (towards the 'front' of the screen), you'll go through
the same screen 5-6 times before coming to two guards who you can fight.
When the battle's over, choose the bottom option to keep fighting or the
top option to run away.  You can fight the same battle over and over,
so when you get tired of fighting, just pick the top option.  An OK place
to gain some experience, gil, and AP, if you think you'll need it.
Anyway, it's a lot faster to just head north to where the green barrier
is and go down the hatch to the west (examine it and choose the top choice
twice).  Pick up the Ether in the adjoining passage, climb down the
two ladders, and talk to the Avalanche member in this area.  Then go
up the ladder near him to reach a room where Jesse is waiting for you.
Take the Potion that's next to him and climb down the ladder on the
left end of the room to reach a chamber where you can find a Tent, a
Save Point, and Biggs.

Go up the ladder here to reach the Makoro Plant.  The room you're in
should be familiar.  Slide down the pipe and then work your way back to
the heart of the plant (where you set the bomb last time).  After Cloud
fiddles with the machinery, go back to the large room and climb up the
stairs and into the elevator.  This time, you'll ride it to a new floor.
Grab the contents of the treasure chest (Ether) and then head to the
left where there are three control panels.  You'll need to hit your
panel as the same time Barett and Tifa hit theirs (using the O button),
so give it a shot.  Instead of waiting for them to raise their arms,
you'll have an easier time if you time it to hit your panel _just_
before they do.  You can't use the panels if you didn't go back to the
heart of the power plant.  Afterwards, go through the opened gate
(there's a Save Point here), and head north.

In the T-shaped room, you'll be stopped by a group of guards, and then
meet the president of Shinra.  After that, a helicopter and a hydrofoil-
like machine show up.  The Shinra president leaves in the helicopter,
but the huge machine attacks you and your friends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: EABASUTAA  (Air Buster)                LV: 15  HP: 1200  MP: 0

This machine turns to face (and attack) whomever hits him.  So, if one of
your characters is low on life, have the person on the opposite side
attack to draw the boss' attention away.  Be especially careful of his
shockwave pounce--it causes tons of damage  (but also increases your
Limit meter quickly).  Remember that even if his back is turned, he can
use a weak machine gun attack on you.  Use potions and the Recovery
Materia to keep up your HPs and use Thunder as well as your Limit Break
attacks to take this machine out.  You'll receive a Titanium Bangle if
you win the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
e.  MAKORO CITY SLUMS
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion, Phoenix Tail, Protect materia, Ether.

After the battle, the boss will explode, sending Cloud off the walkway
in the ensuing blast.  When you awake, you'll find yourself in a church.
Aerith is here, and you can name her after talking to her several times.
Reno (of the Turks, a group of hired thugs that are currently employed
by the Shinra) shows up afterwards with some guards.  In the next room,
Aerith falls down while trying to escape with Cloud.  You now have the
option of fighting the guards using Aerith or trying to bean the guards
on the head with barrels on the upper floor (if you miss, you'll have to
fight using Aerith anyway).  Remember, she starts off in the back row,
so to increase damage, make her move up by choosing 'Change' at the
start of each battle (do this by pressing left, then the O button).

The correct order of barrels to drop is: the leftmost barrel (in the
back), the far right barrel (in the back), and the far right barrel
(in the front).  Simply examine each barrel and choose the top option
to drop it.  This way, Aerith won't have to fight anybody.  When
Aerith meets you at the top of the chapel, she'll hook up with Cloud.

In the next room, climb up the second beam on the left and jump out of
the hole in the roof.  After you and Aerith make it back to ground level,
head left to find a Save Point.  To the northwest is a town.  Be sure to
meet the man in the pipe near the entrance.  There are several stores
here, including one that sells Materia.  To the far, far right is a path
that leads to Aerith's house and a garden.   You can spend the night here
once you've met Erumina, Aerith's mother.  The next morning, look between
the desk and the bed for a Potion and a Phoenix Tail.  Then, sneak
downstairs (or Aerith will make you go back to bed) and leave the house
(you can do this by not touching the walls and not running, either).  In
the lower flower bed to the right, you can get a Protect materia and an
Ether.  There's another Save Point near her house if you need to use it.

Leave the town and go left to the hole in the wall.  Aerith will be here
waiting for you and will rejoin you.  In the next location, work your
way upward (by going across the hole-filled metal length, then down the
iron beams and through the passage, then up the brown pipe and finally
down the stairs and heading to the left).  After Aerith leaves you at the
playground, head right, then up to arrive at the Wall Market.


=========================================================================
f.  WALL MARKET
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Phoenix Tail, Stimulant.

Aerith rejoins you (again) here.  There's a Save Point in the upper-right
part of the village.  The building in the lower left is an inn, where you
can spend the night for 10 gil.  To the right of it is the entrance to a
brothel.  The building in the middle has nothing in it but a computer.
(If you touch it, a machine gun will fire at you and Cloud jumps away.
You can't do anything here until later).  Just above that building is an
item shop.  North of the shop is a sushi bar.  Finally, there is a
clothing store to the upper left and some sort of pottery store to the
upper right.  A path by the clothing store leads to another part of town.
Here, there is a gym, a restaurant, and a weapon shop.  In the northern
area lies a large building.  If you go east from here, you'll reach a
dead-end area.

Your objective in this part of the game is to sneak into the large
building where Tifa is being kept.  To do this, Cloud will have to
dress up as a woman in order to get inside since men aren't allowed
into the building.  So, follow these steps to get the items you need
to 'alter' Cloud's appearance.  You may want to read this entire
section before starting so that you'll know how your choices will
affect the game.

a)  Go to the brothel and talk to the big guy with silver hair who's
    chatting with the bouncer at the door.  Talk to him and pick the
    first option to inquire about Tifa.

b)  Go back to the building at the end of town and talk to the guy
    near the door.  Aerith and Cloud will move away and have a
    short conversation.

c)  Return to the first screen, go to the clothing store, and talk to
    the store owner by standing near the bottom edge of the counter.

d)  Go to the bar in the second screen and talk to the lone man by the
    door.  During the conversation, you'll have to make two decisions.
    So when you're asked a question, pick either the first or second
    choice.  After you're done talking to the man, return to the
    clothing store.

e)  At the store, you'll see that the man from the inn is now behind
    the counter.  Talk to him and you'll receive an item based upon
    your decisions:

    - If you answered: first choice, first or second choice, you'll
      get the Kotton no Doresu (Cotton Dress).
    - If you answered: second choice, first choice, you'll be given
      the Saten no Doresu (Satin Dress).
    - If you answered: second choice, second choice again, he'll give
      you the Shiruke no Doresu (Silk Dress).

f)  Cloud will try on the dress, but won't actually wear it.  Leave
    the clothing store and go to the second screen.  Enter the gym
    and converse with the woman by the fighting ring.  When you
    have the chance, pick the bottom option twice.  As soon as you
    clear her message with the O button, start pressing the S, X,
    and O buttons repeatedly in that order.  The object of the game
    is to go fast enough to make Cloud do more squats than the
    African gymnast, but you don't want to press the buttons too
    fast or Cloud can't keep up.  It's not too hard to win since
    the other guy will often stop to scratch his head, but you only
    have 30 seconds, so get in as many squats as you can.

    - If you are able to do more squats than the gymnast, you'll be
      given the Burondo no Katsura (Blonde Wig).
    - If you and the gymnast have the same score, the lady will give
      you the Cyapatsu no Katsura (?? Wig).
    - If the gymnast does better than you, then the lady will give
      you the Kuzege no Katsura (?? Wig).

At this point, you can just return to the clothing shop and enter the
stall; Cloud will dress up as a woman and you can return to the north
building to get inside.  You can also choose to not change yet and
explore more of the Wall Market, picking up items that you can use to
make Cloud more 'feminine'.  If you're finished, then skip down a ways
to find out what to do next.  Otherwise, keep reading.

g)  Go to the pottery shop.  When you have to choose an answer, pick
    the top one twice.  (You can't talk to him unless you chatted with
    the guard at the north building).  Then go to the inn and pay 10 gil
    to spend the night.  In the middle of the night, you'll find
    yourself in front of the vending machine in the outer hallway.  Pick
    any option (I hope you have enough gil).  The next morning, return
    to the pottery shop and talk to the man to get an item:

    - If you bought the first item (200 gil), he'll give you the
      Daiya no Tiara (Diamond Tiara).
    - If you bought the second item (100 gil), he'll give you the
      Rubii no Tiara (Ruby Tiara).
    - If you bought the third item (50 gil), he'll give you the
      Garasu no Tiara (Glass Tiara).

h)  Enter the sushi bar and walk past the empty seat.  When a message
    appears, choose the top option.  Then choose any option, (you'll
    need 70 gil), followed by the middle choice to get a Kuupon
    (Coupon).  Now go to the item store and talk to the man behind
    the counter.  Choose one of the three options to get an item,
    then head back to the restaurant.  Go to the bathroom and talk to
    the person inside.  Accept the first choice and:

    - You'll get the Koron (Cologne) if you traded the Coupon for the
      first-choice item at the item shop.
    - You'll get the Furawaa Koron (Flower Cologne) if you traded the
      Coupon for the second-choice item at the item shop.
    - You'll get the Sekushii Koron (Sexy Cologne) if you traded the
      Coupon for the third-choice item at the item shop.

i)  Talk to the large man in the white shirt who's standing near the
    edge of the screen to get the Kaado (Card).  He won't give it to
    you unless you talked to the guard by the door of the northern
    building.  Head right to arrive at the brothel.  If you talk to
    the bouncer, he'll let you in once he sees the Card, but Aerith
    refuses to enter.  Inside the brothel, you'll find that the doors
    on the right side are locked, but if you chose the bottom option,
    you can look inside them and peer around using the control pad and
    the O button.  If you look in the upper-right keyhole, you'll see a
    familiar face...a small version of Cait Sith!  If you go to the
    north room and talk to the farthest girl on the right several times,
    you can choose the top option to make her dance faster and faster.
    You now have two choices: you can only do one or the other.  They
    are:

    Examine the lower-left door and pick the top option twice.  In the
    room, talk to the girl and pick the top option three times to take
    a soak with Mukkii and his friends.  Answer however you like while
    in the tub and Cloud will be given the Bikini Pantsu (Bikini Pants).

    Or, examine the upper-left door and pick the top option twice.
    Inside, talk to the ghostly Cloud near the stone tub and Cloud
    will have a psychotic episode.  When you come to, all your HP
    and MP is restored, thanks to...Mukkii :(  Talk to him and choose
    the bottom option.  Then talk to the girl and you'll get the
    Ranjerii (Lingerie).

All done?  There's nothing left to do now but return to the clothing
store and dress up as a woman.  When you finish, go to the large building
in the north and talk to the man by the food carts again.  He'll let you
into a posh-looking parlor.  Now, go up the stairs and into the door on
the far left after talking to the receptionist.  Then, go down the
staircase to the torture room (!) where you'll find Tifa and an Ether by
the smoldering coals.  Once she's joined you, head back up the stairs
and go into the middle door.  Inside is Tifa's kidnapper, the nefarious
Don Corneo.  He will examine each of you when you try to approach him.
Who he picks for his 'friend' is determined by what items you collected
in the Wall Market:

 - He'll pick Cloud if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and
   have the 'best' extra items (the Diamond Tiara, Sexy Cologne, and
   Lingerie or Bikini Pants).
 - He'll pick Aerith if you're wearing the Silk Dress, the Blonde Wig,
   the Lingerie and the Sexy Cologne (in addition to anything else you
   may have).
 - He'll pick Tifa if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and one
   or two of the extra items not mentioned above (or anything worse than
   that).

If Corneo picked Tifa or Aerith, then read below:

In the next room, examine the item bag by the bed to get a Phoenix Tail,
and talk to the man by the television set after talking to the other
henchmen.  After revealing your true nature to the love-struck goons,
they'll fight you.  This is followed by another fight with the other
three punks.  Afterward, get Aerith from the torture chamber and then
go into the middle door again (if Aerith was picked, then you'll meet
Tifa when you go outside).  When you're through intimidating Corneo,
look behind his bead for a Stimulant, then stand by your allies.  He'll
make you choose one of three options.  No matter which one you choose,
you'll fall through a trapdoor.

If Corneo picked Cloud, then you'll end up in his room.  Search behind
his bed for a Stimulant, then talk to him and answer anyway you like.
Your friends will burst in and Corneo will ask you a question; pick any
one you like and you'll still plummet to the sewers below.


=========================================================================
g.  THE SEWERS / TRAIN YARD REVISITED
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion x4, Phoenix Down, Steal materia,
                     Hi Potion x3, Yamabikoenmaku, Ether x2.

Once the cut scene with the Shinra flunkies ends, you'll find yourself
in a sewer.  Before talking to Tifa or Aerith, climb up the stairs to
the south and go along the walkway to nab a Potion.  Before you can
escape, a blue monster attacks your party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: APUSU                                  LV: 18  HP: 1800  MP: 0

His dark wave attack hurts all members, so use Potions and Recovery
Materia to heal your wounds.  Luckily, the dark wave will damage the big
blue guy, too (he uses this attack as a counterattack before dying if he
can manage it).  When he does the reverse dark wave, it causes less
damage to him.  Flame spells work the best on him.  Use Cloud's Limit
Break to harm the boss and use Aerith's Limit Break to heal yourselves.
You'll receive a Phoenix Down for winning the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Climb up the ladder and head right.  Go down into the sewage, then up the
stairs.  Grab the Yellow Materia (Steal) and go down the hatch.  In the
next room, go down the stairs, then climb up the side of the curved
structure.  Climb up the ladder and you'll go outside.  There's a Save
Point here and an item on top of the nearby train car.  Check out
the oil drum by entering the train car (near the Save Point) to get a
Hi Potion.  Get another Hi Potion on the roof of adjacent car, then hop
off onto the iron beam and check the oil drum to the north for a
Yamabikoenmaku.  Walk right, then south and enter the nearby train car
to get a Potion.  Climb up the ladder, head north, and climb down again.
Go north once more through the train car then exit to your left to find
a second Potion.  Then go north to arrive at the next screen.

Here, circle left around the car to get a Potion.  Keep going left to
find an oil can with an Ether inside of it.  Hop on the train to move
the other car out of the way.  Climb atop the formerly blocked car to
net a Hi Potion.  Now, ride the other train back backwards, climb onto
the eastern train car, jump onto the train you just moved, and climb
across it and the last car before going down the ladder to get back to
the front part of the Avalanche train yard.

Head left.  The Avalanche members will be fighting atop the power
generator you first saw when you arrived at the base.  After Wedge
plummets to the ground, save your game at the Save Point and talk to the
man on the left if you need to buy items.  Climb up the stairs and you'll
meet Barett, who is firing at the Shinra helicopter you saw back at the
plant.  The same man who attacked Aerith in the cathedral will jump out,
and you'll have to fight him.  Good thing Barett joins you.  When you
inflict enough damage, the boss runs away!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RENO                                   LV: 17  HP: 1000  MP: 0

This guy packs a wallop.  He can imprison your friends using his golden
Piramiddo (Pyramid) attack, and if he does this to all your members, you
lose.  To break the pyramids, attack your allies (they won't be damaged).
Watch for his spark bolt attack (which can paralyze you) and use your
Limit Breaks whenever possible.  Reiki works well on him.  For some
players, this may be the first battle they lose!  You'll get an Ether
for scaring him off should you win.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
h.  INTO THE SKY
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  See Through materia, Zinc Battery x3, Ether.

After fending off the boss, Shon will kidnap Aerith (and p**p slap her)!
As he escapes, the entire city explodes and falls down a level, destroying
it.  Cloud, Tifa, and Barett all come to in the playground at the Makoro
Slums.  After Barett yells for Marin, Wedge, and his other friends, he
and Tifa join you in the next area.  Go back up to get a sparkling yellow
Materia (See Through), before returning to Wall Market.  The man in the
pottery store will now sell you Materia, and if you go back to the parlor,
you have the option of freeing one of Don Corneo's men from the torture
chamber.  Even if you got the Card the first time around, you can no
longer enter the brothel, BTW.

When you're done, leave and go south from the playground.  Return to the
Area 5 Town and go to Aerith's house.  Talk to Erumina, her mother.  You
can spend the night in the upstairs bedroom once the intermission ends.
Return to the Wall Market and go to the dead-end area near the parlor.
(you'll see a bunch of kids run in there).  Climb up the pipe, and you'll
find yourself high above the town.  If you haven't gotten them already,
go to the 'Machine & Gun' store and talk to the man at the left end of
the store; he'll sell you 3 Zinc Batteries for 300 gil.  You'll need them
to activate the boxes in this part of the game.  With that in mind,
examine the box-shaped object in the lower right to try and start a
nearby propeller.  Head up, and you'll jump onto the propeller.  From
there, make your way to the other box and activate the painted barrier.
Climb up it, and use the O button to jump onto the swinging metal pipe.
After that, climb up to the next screen.

Once here, climb up, then drop down to activate the next box and you'll
find an Ether.  Climb down the lefthand pipe and make your way back up
again.  Instead of dropping down, continue up, and you'll find yourself
at Shin-Ra's headquarters.


=========================================================================
i.  SHIN-RA HEADQUARTERS
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Elixir, Attribute materia, Star Pendant, Four Slot,
                     Affect All materia, Phoenix Tail, Ether, Poison
                     materia, Shurudan x2, Talisman, Technqiues of the
                     Enemy materia, Potion x4, Mithril Bracelet, Boudan
                     Chokki, Guard Up.

(KM's note - I think the actual translation is 'Shin-Ra Building',
but I don't know for sure, so I'll stick with Shin-Ra HQ for now).

There's a Save Point here.  You have the option of either heading to the
left and climbing up a stairwell or barging in through the front door.
Going up the stairs takes forever, but it's free of enemies and you can
get an Elixir that's lying on one of the landings.  On the other hand,
going through the front door and taking the elevators in the back is
faster, but you have to fight several battles along the way.  Not only
that, but you can chase around the Shinra staff before taking the
elevator :)  You can't use the circular lifts by the doors yet, but you
can use them once you reach the 60th floor.  If you go up the stairs,
you'll see a door marked 'Accessories'.  Inside the room, you can look
at a monitor to see a short FMV sequence of the silver car that Rufus
rides around in during the Junon Town celebration (which happens later
on in the game).  There are two chests here, but the woman in this room
won't let you open them.  Remember, if you go through the front, check
the control panel in the elevator (the one that goes haywire) after each
enemy encounter in order to continue upwards.  If you go up the stairs
then change your mind and go back down, you won't have to fight anybody
on the elevators, and the main area of the ground floor will be empty.

No matter what method you use, you'll eventually reach the 59th floor.
Head southeast and kill the armored guards to get the Kaado Kii 60
(60th floor Card Key), then take the lift to the 60th floor.  Here,
you'll have to head to the room in the upper-left and make it to the
other side without being seen by the patrolling guards.  In order to
stay hidden from them, pause behind the gold statues, then lead Tifa
and Barett across using the O button.  If you mess up, not only to you
get attacked (ambush-style combat), but you'll have to start all over
again.  Keep in mind that the set of guards on the right half of the
screen move faster than the ones on the left.

Take the stairway up to the 61st floor.  Talk to everyone here.  A man
who asks you about Aerith will give you the Kaado Kii 62 (62nd floor
Card Key) if you answer ".........".  On floor 62, talk to the man in
the room, Domino, and the man in white, (Hatto) then check out the two
library rooms.  Answer Domino's question and he'll give you the Kaado
Kii 65  (65th floor Card Key).  The problem with this is that the
answer changes with each game you play.  It seems like it would be
easy enough to simply try each answer until you get it right, but you
get an Attribute Materia if you answer correctly the first time.  So,
it's in your best interest to just reset and keep trying in order to get
the materia.  You can buy hints from Hatto if you don't know the answer,
for varying prices (NSS).

The 63rd floor is tricky.  You have to collect 3 Kuupons (Coupons) from
all three rooms, but you're only able to remove 3 gates at a time.  You
can reset the gates by investigating the computer in the right-hand room,
but that also resets the location of the items.  You can move around
using walkways, but to enter them you have to climb into the black, box-
shaped structures (there's one in the computer room).  You can't do that
unless you have at least one of the three items.

To get the items, follow this procedure: activate the computer, then
head to the top of the screen and open the gate farthest to the right.
Head right and open the left-hand gate, then walk right and go south
to enter the room where Coupon A is.  Choose the top option to climb
into the black box and use the walkway to get to the room where Coupon
B is at.  Finally, go through the door in this room and open the gate
to the left, then go north to enter the room containing Coupon C.  Then
use the walkway to return to the computer room.

Now if you want, you can just trade one of the Coupons for an item,
but if you have all three then you'll get all three items.  The trade
setup works like this:

 - Trade Coupon A for the Star Pendant
 - Trade Coupon B for the Four Slot Bracelet
 - Trade Coupon C for the Affect All Materia

To get your items (depending on how many coupons you have) go to the
computer and choose the bottom option,  then the top.  Keep in mind
that you can only do this once.

On the 64th floor, you'll find a Save Point and bedroom to your left.
If you examine the lockers in the back room, you can find a Phoenix
Tail, an Ether, and a megaphone (the Marvelous Cheer), but you can
only take the first two items for now.  Head to the 65th floor.

Here, you have to open a treasure chest, then examine a broken section
of the model in the circular room and choose the top option to repair
it.  This unlocks one of the other chests, allowing you to open it and
use the part inside to repair another section of the model.  When you
have finished, you'll get the Kaado Kii 66 (66th floor Card Key).  You
must fix the model in a counter-clockwise fashion starting from the
bottom.  The order of the chests you open goes like this:

 - Upper-left room:   bottom chest
 - Upper-left room:   top chest
 - Lower-left room:   left chest
 - Lower-left room:   top chest
 - Upper-right room:  chest
 - Middle-right room: you can now get the Kaado Kii 66 from here.

On the 66th floor, you can either run into the meeting hall as quickly
as you can, or you can enter the stall in the bathroom located in the
northwest corner of the floor.  Choose the middle option, and you'll
climb on top of the toilet and enter an air duct.  Move forward to
see what the Shinra members (Riibu, Parumaa, President of Shinra,
Haidekkaa, Houjou, and Sukaaretto) are discussing.  Climb back out,
then climb up the stairwell after Houjou (the pony-tailed scientist)
in the room to the right of the meeting hall.  Note that you'll end
up in the air duct even if you ran into the hall...strange.  On the
next floor (67), talk to the people and keep following the scientist.
After looking in the purple chamber (and after Cloud gets another
headache), move beyond the crates and to the right to find a Save
Point and a treasure chest with a Poison Materia inside.

Enter the elevator to the north, and then watch as the scientist toys
with Aerith.  Now, choose who you want to protect Aerith, (either
Barett or Tifa), and then you can name the lion-like creature (Red 13)
that was attacking Houjou.  He'll fight alongside you when the mutant
boss shows up.  Don't forget that Red 13 comes equipped with his own
Materia!

BOSS TIPS: SANPURU:HO512      (Sample: HO512)   LV: 19  HP: 1000  MP: 120
           SANPURU:HO512-OPT                    LV:  7  HP:  300  MP:  48

Don't try to kill this guy's little guardians; he'll only create more.
Instead, use Thunder or Flame on him and try Recovery to keep up your own
life power.  Avoid using physical attacks, Cold, or Poison.  This means
that Red 13 is better off using Fire against the boss than attacking.
This battle is easier if you have Barett, who can inflict more damage.
Don't worry about getting poisoned since you can get infected again when
the boss uses the pink gas attack on your characters (there's no point in
trying to de-poison yourselves).  You'll get two Shurudans and a Talisman
should you kill the boss.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tifa and Barett return after the battle.  When you're in control of Cloud
again, be sure to grab the yellow materia (Techniques of the Enemy)
that's left behind in the sample chamber.  Then go up the ladder and head
south.  Talk to the man in the gray coat to get the Kaado Kii 68 (68th
floor Card Key).  Go back down to floor 66 and try entering one of the
lifts; you'll get caught by Ruudo (he's a Turk who you'll be running into
constantly throughout the game).  He and Shon will 'escort' you to a
meeting with the president of Shinra.  Afterwards, you'll end up in
the jail cells on floor 67.  Here, listen to everyone, then go to sleep.

The next morning, you'll find that your door is unlocked.  Investigate
the guard, then talk to Tifa.  Check the guard again to unlock the doors,
then look in on Barett and Red 13.  After freeing your companions, return
to the lab and talk to Red 13.  Talk to him again after taking the
elevator up to the 68th floor, then use the incline to reach the walkway
again.  Go all the way along it until you find two purple Potions, then
climb back down and enter the door from the ground floor.  The green bars
of light won't hurt you; run through them and pick up two more Potions
before climbing up the stairs to the 69th floor.

Go out the center door to reach a Save Point.  Then, run up either of
the purple stairs.  Check out the dead Shinra president, capture Parumaa,
then enter the door to the north to exit the room.  Outside, talk to the
man in white.  He's Rufus, son of the Shinra president.

The other characters will return to the floor below, and you must lead
them outside (I don't know what the difference is when Tifa makes you
choose an option when you're waiting by the door).  Your team now
consists of Red 13, Barett, and Aerith; don't forget to re-equip your
Materia, then head to the lift (by taking the lower door).  When you
activate it, you are attacked by a huge gun-wielding machine while
going down the side of the Shinra HQ.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: HANDOREDDOGANNAA  (Hundred Gunner)       LV: 18 HP: 1600  MP:0
                                                    (weak vs. Ikazuchi)

You can only use long-range attacks, so use Barett's attacks and his
Limit Break as well as magic to harm this foe.  Poison-based magic
inflicts no damage, while Thunder does the most damage.  Red 13 is a
sitting duck if he doesn't have any spell Materia equipped, so be sure
to deck him out with some magic spells (he can still use his Limit Break).
When you inflict enough damage, the boss starts to break down.  After the
second break, he starts firing heat blasts that damage all members, so be
careful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After killing the boss, you must fight a flying machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: HERIGANNA  (Heli Gunner)               LV: 19  HP: 1000  MP: 0
                                                  (weak vs. Ikazuchi)

As with the other boss, don't use Poison but do use Thunder.  You may be
weak after the last battle, so make use of Potions, the Recovery Materia,
and Aerith's B1/1 Break to restore lost life.  You'll win a Mithril
Bracelet when the boss dies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene switches back to Cloud.  Heal yourself if necessary, equip
Materia, then press Start.  Rufus will then attack you.  Remember,
Cloud doesn't have any Materia equipped, and he can only use Materia
that members in the other team aren't using, so be sure you have the
spare Materia orbs you need (I think the number of orbs you have is
changed depending on what option you choose just before Tifa leaves
Aerith and you fight the two previous bosses -NSS-).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RUUFAUSU  (Rufus)                      LV: 21  HP: 500  MP:  0
           DAAKUNEISHON  (Dark Nation?)           LV: 18  HP: 140  MP: 80

Kill the panther guardian first, then go after the boss.  Although you
can't do anything about the panther casting Barrier on Rufus, you can
use magic instead to inflict damage.  He can only hurt you with his
shotgun, so don't worry about healing yourself after each round (just
heal yourself when your life gets lower).  Sock him with your Limit
Breaks and he'll escape onto the circling helicopter after you've
damaged him enough.  Cloud will get a Boudan Chokki and a Guard Up when
the battle ends.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leave the rooftop and head back to where Tifa is waiting for you.  As
Aerith, try to approach the front doors.  After a short conversation,
you and the gang will escape by motorcycle (and truck).  Your team is
now made up of Cloud, Tifa, and Barett.

An option screen appears where you have the following options:

S       Left Attack
X       Switch members
O       Right Attack
T       Main Menu
Start   Return to game

Be sure to re-equip Materia before returning to the game!


=========================================================================
j.  ESCAPE!
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Star Pendant.

Use the controller to move any any direction.  Pressing S makes you slash
to the left, and pressing O makes you slash to the right.  The object
here is to protect your friends in the truck from enemy cyclists.
Eventually, you'll reach a dead end and fight the boss.  The amount of
life you start off with during the battle depends on how much life you
and your friends lost during the high-speed escape.  If a character lost
all his life, he begins with only 1 point when the battle starts, but
since the boss gets to make the first attack, they'll have to be revived
using Phoenix Tails if there area any live party members left.  The boss
is a spiked, armored robot with six wheels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: MOOTAABOORU  (Motor Bore)                LV: 19  2600  MP: 120
                                                    (weak vs. Ikazuchi)

This boss gets a free attack from behind...sheesh.  Most of his attacks
do little damage, but his flamethrower and flying fire sweep attacks
can kill your party in a single blast (the fire sweep does around 220
damage)!  The best way to beat this group is have your party consist of
Aerith and Barett.  Give the Affect all and Recovery materia to either
Cloud or Barett, and give the other character Thunder.  This way, you
can heal with one character, attack with another, and then use Aerith's
Limit Break to keep your life up at all times.  Cold works better than
Flame against the boss (for those characters that don't have Thunder
equipped).  Remember, your rows are reversed when attacked from behind,
so put Cloud and Barett in the back and Aerith in the front if you want
them to line up properly when the boss shows up.  If you beat the boss,
you'll get a Star Pendant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
k.  KALM TOWN / CHOCOBO FARM
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether x3, Peacemaker, Guard Up, 'Summon Chocobo &
                     Moogle' materia.

You'll find yourselves outside of the gate after beating the boss (you
could also see this scene by going south from the church where you met
Aerith the first time).  Decide who will be in your group, then head
towards the screen to exit and arrive at the World Map (the outside
world).

Head northeast to reach Kalm Town.  Go into the inn to see the rest of
the gang waiting for you.  Cloud will talk to the others about Sephiroth
via a series of semi-interactive flashbacks:

- You'll start off in a truck being driven by Shinra soldiers.  After
  talking to the soldiers and Sephiroth (Cloud's former ally in the
  Shinra army and now a wanted criminal), the truck will be stopped
  by a dragon.  You'll have to fight it, but Sephiroth (who is super-
  powerful) can kill it in two hits.  In the flashback, Cloud's
  portrait is different; this 'Young Cloud' is of a low level, but
  Sephiroth is so strong that you need not worry about losing battles.
  However, you can't control Sephiroth's actions and you can't hurt
  him (because of your low level), either.  Although Young Cloud comes
  equipped with an Advance Attack materia and Sephiroth has several
  mastered materia equipped, you can't take them for your own (although
  you can if you use a Game Shark code...see section 14).  Also, Young
  Cloud and Sephiroth can't use Limit Breaks (because they don't have
  any).

- After the battle, you'll end up in Nivelheim, Cloud's hometown.
  Talk to Sephiroth and the guards if you wish, then head north.
  If you want to look around the town, feel free to, but nothing
  you do during this part of the game has an affect on the rest of
  your quest.  One thing you might want to do is go into Tifa's
  house (the large building on the 'southeastern' side of town).
  Choose the top option when you're prompted to, then go up the
  stairs and choose the top option again.  Approach the piano in
  the nearby room and pick the bottom option; Cloud plays a tune
  on the piano that you can play yourself when you arrive at
  Nivelheim later in order to get Tifa's Limit Break manual (see
  section 14 for details).  Also note that you can't get Vincent
  Valentine during Cloud's flashback because you can't examine
  the safe :(

- When you're done looking around town, go to the inn and head
  upstairs.  Talk to Sephiroth twice and choose the bottom option.
  The next day, talk to Sephiroth and get your picture taken, then
  sit back and watch the FMV.  When you're in control of Cloud,
  head along the bridge and talk to Tifa, then talk to her again
  further along the bridge and it will break.  After you've
  recovered, head northeast into the cave, then keep heading north.
  Eventually, you'll arrive at the Jenova plant.  Enter it, head
  along the beams, then walk onto the wood platform and climb down
  the chains and go after Sephiroth.  Talk to him in the next area,
  examine the chamber to the left of Sephiroth, then talk to him
  twice, once to make him move out of the way and once to make Cloud
  look inside the chamber.  After Sephiroth goes ballistic, you'll
  return to Kalm Town.  Pick the top option to save your game, or
  the bottom option to continue.  Cloud's narrative starts off back
  at Nivelheim, where he enters the large mansion at the edge of
  town.

- Inside, climb the two staircases and head to the right.  Enter the
  lower door and make your way into the next room; if you examine
  the circular part of the stone wall, a passage appears.  Enter it
  and climb down the spiraling walkway until you reach the bottom;
  keep walking from here to find a library.  Leave after Sephiroth
  finishes talking.  After Cloud wakes up, return to the library.
  Sephiroth gives a little speech then he exits the mansion; return
  to the town square.  Try entering the house to your right.

- Back at the Jenova plant, return to the area with the chambers after
  witnessing the struggle between Tifa and Sephiroth.  Examine Tifa to
  carry her out of harm's way, then run up the stairs and enter the
  door that Sephiroth opened.  After the FMV sequence, Cloud's
  flashback ends and you are returned to Kalm Town.

Note that you have to go to Kalm Town to proceed with the game; you can't
make your way through the Mithril Mines beforehand, although you can
visit the Chocobo Farm if you want to.  As for treasure, there's an
Ether in the door beneath the stairs in the house near the inn, another
Ether in the cabinet on the second floor of the house to the right of
that house, and a Peacemaker in the chest on the second floor of the
third house (take the curving stairs).  If you take the normal stairs in
the same house, you can get a Guard Up in the cabinet by the little girl.
Finally, in the house on the other side of the town, there is an Ether in
the door beneath the stairs on the north wall of the first floor.  Oh,
you'll be given the PHS (Party Hensei System) when you talk to your
allies on the first floor of the inn; it allows you to switch group
members whenever you want, providing that you're in the World Map or
standing on a Save Point (there are a few exceptions to this rule).

Leave the town and head east to reach the Chocobo Farm.  Talk to the
Chocobo at the front end of the pen and choose the top option to see
the big yellow birds dance; you'll get the 'Summon Chocobo and Moogle'
materia afterwards.  Then, talk to Guringurin (the man with the hat)
in the stables behind the pen.  Choose the first option, then the 4th
option, then the top option again.  Providing you have 2000 gil to
spare, he'll sell you a 'Chocobo Attract' materia, which lets you
attract chocobos to ride.

To catch a chocobo, wander around outside on the chocobo tracks (in
this area of the game, you can meet them on the light patches of
grass, too), until you are attacked.  If a chocobo is one of your
opponents, then kill off the other enemies and when the battle ends,
you'll be riding the chocobo.  If you attack the chocobo, it will
hurt you and the other enemies, then escape, so you'll have to try
again.  Don't forget, you can only fight chocobos if you have the
Chocobo Attract materia equipped.  When riding a chocobo, your can move
around normally, and you won't get attacked by enemies.  You can press
X to dismount, but if you do this, the Chocobo will run away and you'll
have to catch another one.

A little to the south and directly west of the Chocobo farm is a cave,
but a creeping snake in the marsh before the cave entrance will rise up
to attack you.  Instead of trying to kill it now, go get a Chocobo
instead, who can outrun the snake and enter the cave.  Yes, you will
still get attacked if the snake touches your chocobo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: MIDOGARU ZUORUMU  (Midgar Zolem?)    LV: 26  HP: 4000  MP: 348

This boss has two deadly attacks: one is a tail swipe that knocks a team
member off-screen and puts them out of commission for the rest of the
battle.  The other one is the Beta enemy skill, which inflicts around
1000-1200 points of damage (which spells instant defeat if your allies
are weak, although you should try to pick up this skill if you have a
Teki no Waza equipped).  Along with his bite attack, this serpent can be
a tough enemy if you try to fight him earlier in the game.  It's easier
if you try to defeat him after you have Cid's airplane, since you can
use Limit Breaks and powerful summon and magic spells to kill it.
Unfortunately, you get a measly amount of EXP, AP, and gil for beating
the boss and what's worse, he reappears when you return to the World
Map, so you're right back where you started.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first time you reach here, you'll see a large snake impaled on a
tree.  Just exit the screen to continue playing.  Also, if you get
off your chocobo while on the patch of grass before the mine entrance,
he'll stay there in case you need to return to the farm (this doesn't
seem to happen all the time--I don't know why).


=========================================================================
l.  MITHRIL MINE / JUNON TOWN
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Tent, Long Range Attack materia, Mind Up x2,
                     Elixir, Power Wrist, 'Summon Shiva' materia,
                     Shurudan or Potion x6 or Ether x6, Technqiues of the
                     Enemy materia, 1/35 Shin-Ra x x2, Luck Up, Power Up,
                     Guard Up, Speed Up, Silver Edge Glasses or HP Up or
                     Force Eater.

Inside the Mithril Mine, head northeast to find a green Ether on the
stone steps.  In the chest is a Tent, so be sure to grab it.  If you
try climbing up the brown vine on the western rock face, you'll find
a purple materia (Long Range Attack).  Climb back down, return to the
first area, then head left.  Make your way southeast to find a chest
with a Mind Up inside, then head west to reach the next area.

Here, you'll run into some of the Turks again: Ruudo, Iriina, and Shon.
Once they leave, walk north.  There's a chest with a Elixir inside it
and a Hi Potion just to the north of the chest.  Return to the area
where you met the Turks, climb up the vine, and go through the door to
exit the mine and return to the World Map.

Nearby is a rocky outcropping with a huge bird statue atop it, the Condor
Fort.  Enter it and choose the second option when talking to the man out
front.  After climbing up the rope, you'll find yourself in a town built
into the rock itself.  There is a Save Point, item shop, bedroom (you can
sleep for free), and Materia shop here.  Talk to everyone, then leave and
go northwest through the forest to Junon Town by the shore.

Once you arrive at Junon, talk to the villagers, then go down the stairs
to the shore.  Here, a young girl named Purishira is playing with a
dolphin.  Out of nowhere, a big flying boss shows up and attacks her,
then your party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: BOTOMUSUWARU  (Bottom Swayer)        LV: 23  HP: 2500  MP: 100

There's not much to worry about; just attack with Thunder or Poison-based
spells and keep your life up.  Since this guy's flying, some characters
can't attack him (like Tifa), while some can (like Cloud).  Find out
which guys should be casting magic and which should be attacking early on
in the battle.  Sometimes, the boss puts an HP-reducing bubble around a
character.  It only disappears if you cast a magic spell upon it (this
won't hurt the 'bubbled' person).  If you have the Affect All materia,
you can use this to cast a spell on the bubbled person and the boss at
the same time.  Before dying, the boss will attack with a wave, (he
can do this normally, but always does one before he disappears) so watch
out and make sure your hp is high enough to withstand an attack.  If you
want, you can equip characters (like Barett) with weaker, long-ranged
weapons so that they can attack the boss, but it may not be worth it.
You'll receive a Power Wrist when the battle is over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After killing the boss, you'll have to revive Purishira.  To do this,
watch the lung-shaped meter that appears in the upper right.  Press
the S button once to make the meter start to raise.  Just as it reaches
the top, press S again to make Cloud breathe into the girl's mouth.
It will take a couple of tries.  Afterwards, go to the house near the
entrance to town and talk to the person there (for some reason, choosing
the top option won't make Cloud go to bed, but if you go back in the
house and try again, he will go to sleep).

During the night, Cloud will have another bad dream.  In the morning,
leave and go to the house above the stairs (your friends will be
gathered near it).  Purishira will give you the 'Summon Shiva' materia,
a gift for saving her life.  Follow her to the shore, then talk to her
a second time.  Barett will show up and the girl will keep talking;
when you have the chance, choose the middle option.  Your goal in this
part of the game is to leap atop the iron beam above the electrical
tower so that you can sneak into the heart of Junon Town.  Your
controls are:

X        Swim faster
S        Makes the dolphin flip you into the air

If you get to close to the electric blasts traveling along the tower,
you'll get shocked and will have to try again (just pick the second
option).  The easiest way to get up there is to simply not move and
press S.  The dolphin will miss and deposit you near the bottom of
the screen.  However, you'll be perfectly positioned, so if you press
X again, Cloud will land on the beam.  Once you're on it, head to the
left to get a good view of the flying airship 'Highwind'.  Make your
way south (towards the 'front' of the screen) to continue.

The next area has a higher and lower level.  If you investigate the box-
like switch, you'll be taken to the lower level.  From there, head south
to find a building.  There is a projecting roof nearby which has a door
underneath it; just press against the edge and you'll enter a hallway
filled with soldiers.  In the halls, go up to find a locker room.  Check
out the half-open locker and choose the second option to dress up as a
guard.  When the captain of the guards asks you another question, pick
the bottom answer.

Then, leave the locker and take note of the Save Point before heading
through the door (follow the other soldiers).  Now that you're outside,
go into the first alleyway.  You'll come across a group of marching
soldiers.  The head guard will want you to join in and march with them
perfectly, so it may take a couple of attempts before this event will
end.  You also have to move your gun in time with the soldiers by
pressing and releasing the O button.  Depending on how high or low the
counter was during this scene (the one in the lower right-hand corner),
you will get the following:

   PERCENT      NAME        TYPE
   21%       =  Shurudan    Item
   37% - 39% =  Potion x6   Item
   45% (?)   =  Ether x6    Item
   (I'll figure out the rest later....)

Afterwards, you'll have to stand at attention while Rufus and Haidekkaa
talk to each other...press in any direction and the captain of the guard
will tell you to get back in line.  After the rest of the soldiers leave,
the captain will give you an option; choose either option and you'll
return to the locker room for some training on the next event.  There,
you can try to follow the captain's orders, if you wish.  When he asks
you a question, choose the top choice to try training again, or the
bottom option to finish the training.  Once the soldiers leave, follow
them outside.

Now's your chance to do a little shopping and treasure hunting.  You'll
run into Ruudo in the basement of the first weapon shop, but he won't
recognize you in your Shinra guard uniform.  Go through the third door
and talk to the guard near the back of the room, then jump down to an
area with several Shinra guards and some holograms.  In the far corner
of the room is a yellow materia (Techniques of the Enemy).  This place
(I believe) is similar to the 'House of Learning' back in Area 7 Town
where you could learn about the game's mechanics.   On the second floor
of the same building, you can get a 1/35 Shin-Ra x and a Mind Up.  In the
room with the cats nearby is a Luck Up.  On the third floor is a red
Power Up and a green Guard Up.

If you enter the fourth door on the other side of town, you'll find that
that Iriina, Rudo, and Shon of the Turks are here.  It's a good thing
that you're in that uniform :)  Go through the sixth door to find a room
with a soldier; you can check the silver trashcan for a message and pick
up a yellow Speed Up in the side room.  On the floor above, you can pick
up another 1/35 Shin-Ra x.

In the next area, Haidekkaa and Rufus show up again.  You have to do
your salute according to what the captain of the guard tells you to do
(remember your training)!  At the very end, all you have to do is be
facing forward: pressing any button will make you do the 'spinning gun'
salute.  Unfortunately, the order of commands is random each time you
play, so just do your best.  Afterwards, you can press the following
buttons to make Cloud do funny things:

S       Scratch back with gun
X       Put one leg forward
T       Shrug
Pad     Stand at attention

Depending on how well you did during the salute, Heidekkaa will give you
an item.  Each 'button press' action was worth 10 points, and the final
salute was worth 30 points.  Changing direction was worth 0 points, but
unless you were facing in the correct direction, any action you performed
was worth 0 points.  Also, performing an action was worth 0 points if you
did it too late (although you'll get full points if you do the action
early).  Your total score determines what you will receive (notice that
Rufus' reactions change depending on what item you will be given):

   SCORE        NAME                     TYPE
   000 - 050 =  Silver Edge Glasses      Accessory
   060 - 090 =  HP Up                    Independent Materia
   100 - 190 =  Force Eater              Weapon (for Cloud)
      200    =  (I'll figure out this one later....)

After everyone else leaves, Red 13 (who was watching from just inside the
boat) will talk to you if you try to leave instead of boarding the boat.
Either way, you'll end up joining your friends in the boat's hull.


=========================================================================
m.  SHIN-RA BOAT
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Affect All materia, Wind Slasher, White Cape.

Open the treasure chest to get an Ether, and be sure to pick up the blue
materia (Affect All).  Talk to the people here, then go up on the deck and
talk to everyone else; you'll notice that some of them are your companions
(don't miss Red 13 :)).  The man in white will sell you items if you talk
to him.  Once you're done, go back down and talk to Aerith, then return
to the deck and go all the way to the left; one of the guards has left,
allowing you to sneak to the front of the ship.

Here, talk to Barett, who is spying on the Shinra members.  After talking
to him a couple of times, an alarm will sound.  Go back to the center of
the boat to find your friends.  Then, assemble your party.  If you want
to change the setup, talk to your friends again.  When you're ready, go
downstairs and head through the door that the one guard was standing in
front of.  In the next room, watch out for enemies and climb up the
ladder, the walkway leads to a chest with a Wind Slasher inside.  Did you
get all the items on the boat?  When you're ready, go and talk to the
captain of the guards.  It turns out that he's dead.  Then, Sephiroth
shows up, and summons a huge monster for you to fight before he flies
away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*BIRTH  (Jenova*Birth)         LV: 25  HP: 4000  MP: 110

Earth, Flame, and Cold magic work well against it, but don't use Poison.
Attack with your Summon Materia and hit it with everything you've got.
Keeping your HP up is a priority, since it can use lasers to attack one
or all members.  Only use physical attacks if you are running low on MP.
The boss can cast 'Stop' on a single ally so make sure that you're not
too dependent on any one character during the battle.  Some Phoenix
Tails will also come in handy, since the boss sometimes uses a laser
that hits all allies (Terror Laser) twice in a row (which can inflict
loads of damage).  You'll get a White Cape when the battle is over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
n.  COSTA DEL SOL / NEW CONTINENT
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  'Summon Ifrit' materia, Power Up x2, Motor Drive,
                     Flame Ring, Double Machinegun, Ether Turbo,
                     Transform materia, Wizard Rod, Star Pendant,
                     Gold Needle x2, Phoenix Tail x10, Mind Up, Tent.

Grab the red Materia (Summon Ifrit) after the battle and wait for the
boat to dock.  Talk to the people here and then go up the stairs.  A
short automatic sequence follows.  In the next area, go into the door
to meet a shady guy who will sell you this room for 30,000 gil; you can
sleep here for free anytime you want afterwards.  Climb down the stairs
in the bottom part of the room to reach a basement with a sleeping man.
You can get a Power Up and a Motor Drive here, as well as a Flame Ring
from the treasure chest.  You'll meet Mukkii (from the cabaret in the
Wall Market) in the bar, as well as some of his friends.  If you go down
to the beach, you'll run into Houjou (the scientist you met in the
Shinra HQ).  You can talk to him if you want, but you won't get anything
out of it.

Outside of the town, head through the mountains and across the bridge.
You'll find a cave-like entrance.  Talk to the man on the hill, then
keep heading north.  Eventually, you'll reach a walkway that leads to
a large Makoro furnace.  Head south and follow the train tracks; there's
no point in looking around here.  Keep going, and you'll come across
some curving tracks and a Save Point.  As you walk along the tracks, you
can get the following items:  Double Machinegun, Ether Turbo, and a
Transform materia.

These tracks are rickety, and when you walk across them in certain areas
a message will appear telling you to press O so that you don't fall
through them.  It's better to let yourself fall, because you can then
hold left or right and rapidly press O to land beneath the tracks.  Then,
press Up to climb back up.  If you landed on the left side of the tracks,
you can pick up a Wizard Rod.  If you landed in the middle, you can't
get anything, but if you landed on the right side, you'll find a Star
Pendant.  There are three places where you can fall through the tracks,
so be sure to get these items.

Take the upper rail path to the next area.  Are your friends waiting for
you on the lower track?  If they're not, then go back and take the lower
path.  You'll get an option to summon them using the PHS system (NSS).
Assuming they're there, take the upper path and keep walking until you
find a wooden shed.  Enter it and pick the top choice when you're
prompted to make a decision.  This will lower the tracks on the bottom
path.  Before returning to the lower rail path and following after your
allies, you can walk to the end of the path you're on and climb the wall;
you'll hear birds chirping if you're in the right place.

After finding the nest, you can choose to take the treasure in the nest
(the top option), or leave the birds alone (the bottom option).  If you
choose the top option, you're attacked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS: KOKATORISU  (Cocatrice)                      LV: 17  HP: 420  MP: 0

This guy's easy; just attack until it dies.  You'll get 10 Phoenix Tails
should you kill it.  You can get two Gold Needles from it; one by
stealing, the other by killing it with Metamorphosis.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get 10 Phoenix Tails after the battle is over.  Cloud will then
return to the train tracks.  Keep in mind that this is a one-shot deal;
whether you decide to take the treasure or not, you can only make a choice
one time.  As you're traveling along the lower rail path, you'll see a
part where the track splits in two directions.  Take the left path (the
one that turns back).  Walk north (towards the bridge), then right (under
the first bridge).  It may sound confusing, but you'll end up in a little
shack where there's a bunch of items and a man resting on a bulldozer.
There's a Mind Up and a Power Up here, and the chest has a Tent inside of
it.  Leave and follow the other path across the bridge in the next area
to reach the town of North Corel.


=========================================================================
o.  GOLD SAUCER
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Silver Bracelet, 'Summon Ramuh' materia.

There's some merchants here at North Corel and an inn.  You can also
learn more about Barett here, whether he's in your party or not.  When
you're done shopping and chatting, go to the sky lift.  After Barett has
a flashback about his friend Dain, take the lift up to the Gold Saucer.
You can return to the World Map by heading right from the bottom area of
the town, but there's nothing to do out there (aside from saving your
game or riding around on a Chocobo).

You'll see a Save Point in the background of the first area of the Gold
Saucer, but you'll need GP (not gil, like what you've been using) to
activate it.  Pay the man to get in (the first choice is for a one-time
entrance, the second choice will let you enter as often as you'd like),
and then choose the path of your choice after your companions separate.

If you try to leave the Station Square (the area where you're at; all
the areas in the Saucer are divided into 'squares'), Aerith will join
you.  As you explore the rest of the Gold Saucer, you'll discover that
Shinra soldiers are snooping around, looking for Sephiroth.  When
you're ready to move on, go to the Wonder Square.  Here, you'll meet
Cait Sith, a would-be fortuneteller.  He'll automatically join you since
you only have two members (you and your friend) at this point.

Go to the Battle Square and you'll find a bunch of dead bodies; the
handiwork of Sephiroth.  As you're talking to the few who are still
alive, Dio, the proprietor of the Gold Saucer shows up and promptly
blames you for the carnage.  Cait Sith makes a dash for freedom, but
after following him, the party is trapped.  Dio and his henchmen then
summon three large robots that throw you and your allies through the
'Gateway to Heaven' to a desolate area, the Corel Prison, which lies
at the base of the Gold Saucer.

Here, you'll find Barett.  After he runs away, examine the dead body
and talk to the other guy before going though the southern gate.  There
is a treasure chest here (in the chamber at the base of the ladder), but
it's already opened (anyone know if there's supposed to be something in
it that you could have gotten earlier?)

In the second area, talk to everyone here.  The building to the far
southeast is a bar, and a man inside will sell you items.  After looking
around here, enter the building to the east (it doesn't matter which
entrance you take).  Barett will show up once you're inside, as will
Tifa and Aerith.  After Barett's flashback (in which his best friend
falls down a gorge and North Corel is razed to the ground), reassemble
your team and go back to the first area.  Examine the guard (who is
dead), then either leave through the gate.  If you exit by going through
the area between the gate and the building to the right, you'll end up
wandering around in a wasteland until a caravan (the same one that Tifa
was captured in) shows up.  When it does, pick the top option to get a
ride back to the area beyond the gate or choose the bottom option to
stay where you are (in the middle of nowhere...you'll have to keep
wandering around until the caravan shows up again).

Anyway, once you've gone past the gate, talk to the man out here and go
to the _right_.  Any other direction leaves you stranded in the desert
(read the above paragraph again if you want to get back on track).  This
takes you to the caryard.  Go up from here and you'll run into none
other than Dain (the guy from Barett's flashback).  He tells Barett
about Erenoa and Marin (who is actually his daughter), then (for what
reason, I have no idea), decides to attack Barett.  In the battle,
you're forced to fight using just Barett.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: DAIN                                  LV: 23  HP: 1200  MP: 20

The easiest way to kill this boss is simply let him hit you; his attacks
increase your Limit meter quickly.  Use the Kaifuku Materia to restore
lost life, then hit him with the Heavy Shot when your meter maxes out.
A summoning Materia (like Shiva or Ifrit) is also a good way to inflict
added damage.  Just make sure you have all the MPs you need, and you can
win in no time.  The boss can pull off a final attack before dying, so
keep your life up (but he can't do it if you kill him fast enough).  You
get a Silver Bracelet for beating him.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Barett's friend dies, you'll find yourself back in the trailer.
After talking to Kooshi (Coach?), you'll be invited to become a Chocobo
racer.  In the elevator shaft, choose the top option to have the racing
process explained to you (NSS), or pick the bottom one to skip it.  In
the room with the other men, check the alcove by the Chocobo poster for
a red Summon Materia (Ramuh).  Then, talk to the girl in pink (Esuto) to
start racing.

Your controls as a Chocobo racer are:

S               Speed Up
X               Speed Down
O               Dash  (uses up your Dash Meter)
Select          Switch between Automatic and Manual control
R1+R2           Hold these buttons to refill your Dash Meter.

The more you Dash, the slower your walking speed is, so conserve your
Dash Meter for when you really need it.  You have to keep racing until
you win, so get good fast!  Esuto will explain the controls to you again
prior to the race if you choose the top option, or you can conclude your
conversation with her and start racing by choosing the bottom option.
If you can't get the hang of it, then just keep racing using the
Automatic Sequence mode until you get first place.

After winning, you'll receive the Bagii (Buggy) as first prize, and can
now roam freely about the overworld and even pass through shallow rivers!
(Look for lighter-shaded fords along the rivers.)  Your controls are set
up in the following manner:

X               Exit buggy
O               Enter buggy
T               Main Menu
Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
L2/R2           Change view

You _can_ run into enemies in the buggy, so be careful.  Also, you can
only return to the Golden Saucer if you take the sky lift from North
Corel Town; you can't get there using the buggy.  If you go across the
river south from the Golden Saucer and look around, you'll find a house
on a peninsula; you can't explore it yet, so ignore it for now.  BTW,
you can return to the desert if you get in the buggy, enter the dirt pit
surrounding the Saucer, and touch the houses at the base of the Saucer.
However, you'll find that there's nothing to do here but wander through
the desert--do so long enough and the same cart that Tifa was abducted
in will pull up and offer you a ride back to your vehicle.  Choose the
top option to accept and the bottom option to stay where you are.  And
as the help menu indicates, it's possible to return to Junon Town and
take the Buggy with you.  After you've completed the scenario with Cid,
you can explore the house on the penninsula; you can also get Aerith's
Level 4 Limit Break manual at that point in the game (see section 14
for details).


=========================================================================
p.  GONGAGA TOWN / COSMO CANYON
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Fairy Tail, X Potion x2, 'Summon Titan' materia,
                     Certain Kill materia, Additional Effect materia,
                     Ether, Black Megaphone, X Potion, Fairy Ring, Ether
                     Turbo, Confusion/Vizier Rod, Gravity materia (and
                     you can get an Elixir, Magic Up, and the Full Cure
                     materia here from Disc 2 onwards).

Your next goal should be to head south from the Golden Saucer across the
river to a forested area.  Go into the black structure (it's called
Jungle, for some reason).  Reno and Ruudo are here.  After Iriina shows
up and alerts the other Turks to your prescence, you'll be asked a
question.  No matter what your answer is, you'll have to fight
Reno and Ruudo at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RENO                                  LV: 22  HP: 2000 MP: 80
           RUUDO                                 LV: 23  HP: 2000 MP: 135

Use Summoning spells to even the odds at the start of the round, then go
after either one.  Once you injure one enough times, he'll leave, then
the other one will.  It may be better to attack Ruudo, since he can heal
himself and Reno, but then again, Reno can inflict more damage.  In any
case, this fight isn't too hard either way.  You'll get a Fairy Tail and
a X Potion should you win the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the Turks leave, head northeast, then go north to reach a pile of
scrapped machinery.  As you're looking around, Sukaretto and Shon show
up in the Shinra helicopter and talk about 'Huge Materia' (which you'll
learn more about in Disc 2).  After they leave, examine the area where
Sukaretto was standing and choose the bottom option to get the 'Summon
Titan' materia.  Then go back to the first area and head left.  In the
second area, there is a Certain Kill materia near the left path (which
returns you to the World Map).  If you take the north path, you'll
arrive at Gongaga Town.

Be sure to visit the stores (don't forget that you can climb up the pole
in the Accessory Shop to reach a room where you can buy weapons) and
get the treasure chests from the inn (X Potion) and the old man's
house (White Megaphone).  If you go into the far right house, you'll meet
an old couple who apparently know Cloud (or someone just like him), and
someone else named Zekkusu.  When you're done here, return to the World
Map.  Head southwest, then turn toward the river and go over the
shallows, and then make your way up through the mountains to reach Cosmo
Canyon.  If you try to drive past the town, the buggy will short out,
so you don't really have any choice but to enter the town (and you can't
get anywhere else without the buggy, so even if you didn't drive it past
Cosmo Canyon and entered on foot, it wouldn't matter....)

When you approach the man at the gate, Red 13 will talk to him (he'll
either bound up the steps past your party if he's not with you, or he'll
just leave your party and start talking if he was with you previously).
Everyone here knows Red 13 by the name 'Nanaki'.  After Red heads up the
stairs, talk to the guard and choose the bottom option to be let into the
town (Red 13 will reappear to make sure you guys get in).  If he was in
your party, you'll have the option to make a new team; otherwise, you can
look around town freely.  Don't miss the Save Point located in the
Tigerlily Arms Shop.  In the Item Shop, there is a passage with a red
rope across it that prevents you from checking out the room in the back.
Keep this place in mind because if you return to Cosmo Canyon in Disc 2
or 3, the rope will have been removed and you can get an Elixir, a Magic
Up, and the Full Cure materia orb from the back room.

Eventually head up to the observatory, where you'll run into Red 13
and Buugen Haagen, an old geezer who knows all kinds of things.  After
Red 13 leaves, go back down and talk to your friends in order to make
a new party.  Then talk to Red 13 in the room connected to the inn
before returning to the observatory.  Enter the side door, chat with
Buugen Haagen, and you'll see a short FMV sequence.

When it's over, return to the large bonfire to the right of the
entrance.  Your friends are here.  Talk to everyone here, then chat
with Red 13 a second time.  Buugen Haagen will show up, and you'll
make a new group (with Red 13 as a permanent member).  If you want
someone else, just talk to another ally (it doesn't matter which one).
Follow Buugen Haagen back to the sealed door above the weapons shop
and talk to him, then choose the top option.  He'll open the door for
you.  Enter and climb down to the very bottom of the shaft, then head
left.

In the next area, head right and up until you see a hole facing left*.
Enter it and you'll be given an option.  Pick the top one to make an
opening appear nearby.  Go through it, then head up and left.  You'll
slide on the oil and hit a spiked wall, reducing every member's HP by
500 points.  Then go south, through the hole, and head right to reach
the Combination materia you couldn't get in the first area (Additional
Effect).  Go back and carefully _walk_ along the edge of the path to
avoid slipping across the oil.  Then go right, up, left, down the
stairs, and through the underpassage to reach a chest with an Eeteru
inside of it.  Then return to the stairs and go left, then down to
find a second chest containing a Black Megaphone.  Then climb back up
the stairs and head to the upper-left to leave this area.

*  If you enter any of the other three holes, you'll be given the
   same option, but if you choose the top choice, you'll be attacked.
   Doing this doesn't seem to alter the level in any way, but you're
   better off doing this after you've cleared the _whole_ area out
   instead of doing it right now; I'd rather be safe than sorry, in
   my opinion.

There are five passages in this area; you only want to take the 2nd and
4th passages from the left.  First, take the 4th passage.  When you
touch the web beyond it, you'll have to fight a giant spider (Stinger).
When you've killed it, follow the path north to find a chest with an
X Potion inside.  Then go back and take the 2nd passage from the left.
Kill the Stinger that attacks you when you touch the web and then head
left and down.  As you're going through the tunnel, hold right and
you'll find an alternate path that leads to yet another treasure chest.
You'll find a Fairy Ring in it.  Go back up to where the web was and
walk north to find another web.  Past it is the exit, but try holding
left and Cloud will go along a passage hidden by the rock that leads to
a chest.  There's an Ether Turbo inside.

When you approach the giant face in the next cavern, it begins to move
and you are attacked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: GI*NATATAKU                          LV: 29  HP: 5500  MP: 200

Don't worry about the Soul Fires this boss has with him; just use your
Summon Materia, then concentrate on attacking and using Limit Breaks on
the big guy himself.  If your spell Materia has hit second level, then
Cold and Thunder work nicely on him.  You don't even need to worry
about your life much; the boss can be taken down before any serious
damage is done to your party.  You'll get a Confusion/Vizier Rod should
you be successful in battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the spell Materia (Gravity) that's left behind and follow Buugen
Haagen up the steps.  After the sequence with Red 13 and the other
creature (his father, who was transformed into metal or something?),
make a new party and leave the town.  Don't worry, Red 13 will rejoin
you when you try to leave.  Oh yes, the Buggy will be working again
when you leave Cosmo Canyon.

                     materia, not to mention a Key Item (the gold key).

Get in the buggy and continue past Cosmo Canyon.  Head north to find a
river with a shallow ford you can cross.  Past it, the mountains are
of a different type than what you usually see.  Near them is a small
town, Nivelheim.  Look familiar?  It's the same one Sephiroth and Cloud
went to in Cloud's flashback.

First, go into the inn.  Talk to the black creature in the back to get
a Luck Up.  You can get an Elixir from another one of the creatures
in the Item Shop, and a second Luck Up if you talk to the small
creatures in the upper floor of the southeastern house.  The large house
to the east is Tifa's home, and you'll be given a Platinum Fist and an
Ether Turbo if you talk to the creatures here.  There's a piano in
Tifa's room that you can fool around with (see section 14 for details).

This next section is optional--you can just continue on through the
mountains if you want.  However, Sephiroth won't show up in the
mansion after you reach Disc 2, meaning you can't nab the Annihilation
materia unless you get it from him during the first disc (read below
for details).

Now, go into the large mansion at the edge of town.  Left of the
entrance is a piece of paper written by the Turks (?).  It has
several hints on it that clue you in to the combination of the safe on
the upper floor (but it's useless if you don't know Japanese :)).
You can get the 4th number by chosing the blank space beneath the
first three tips (look at the paper, choose the top option, then move
the cursor down to the blank space and press O).

Head right and look for the sliver of light near the stairway, it's
very hard to see.  It's an opening that leads to the lower section of
another room.  There's a chest here, with a Silver Megaphone inside.
Go back out and go into the northern door beneath the staircase.  In
the adjoining hall, head right and and up to find a chest with a
Twin Viper in it.  To the left is a room with a broken piano (which
you could have also reached by looking for the opening near the left
staircase in the main room).

Go up the stairs and head left.  In the circular room is a chest that
has an Enemy Launcher inside.  There's nothing in the northern room
except for a locked safe--you'll need the right combination in order
to open it (see section 14 if you don't know how).  If you want to
try your luck, examine it with the O button and choose the top option
to enter the combination or the bottom option to quit.

Open the safe (or not), then go right and into the right wing of the
manor house.  If you go up, you'll find a chest with a Magic Up
inside.  Then go into the lower room and examine the curved wall to
open a secret passage.  Go down the spiralling walkway, and then head
right.  If you got the gold key from the safe, you can open the
northern door (refer to section 14 for details).  Continue to the
right to find a libarary.  Then go north and you'll run into none
other than Sephiroth, who will pelt you with a green materia before
flying away.  Be sure to get the materia (Annihilation) before
leaving the mansion.

Once you're back outside, leave Nivelheim from the northern entrace
and contine along until you see a passage leading into the mountains.
In the next area, follow the path until it splits, and take the north
path, which wraps around the back of a spire and leads to a chest
with a Rune Blade inside of it.  Now go back and follow the original
path.  You'll notice that just before the bridge, there's a path that
curves away to the north.  Follow it up into the mountains and when
it curves south, take that path instead of continuing in the same
direction.  The path curves several times, but eventually you'll make
it to the top of the mountain, where you can find a chest with a
Platinum Baretta.  It may help if you press SELECT so that you can see
yourself when a mountain is blocking your view, and if you can't seem
to get any further, press in other directions (like down) to scale the
back of the mountain.

Go back down to the main path and head up the bridge.  Inside the
cavern, take the ladder down instead of the tubes, or you won't be
able to get all the treasure in this area.  You don't have to worry
about the large boss near the door just yet.  Feel free to make use
of the Save Point, then climb back to the top of the area.  Enter the
pipe labled '2' to end up on a rocky ledge.  There's an item bag here
with an Overthrow inside; get it and then press down to jump down
to a lower ledge, then press down again to reach the floor.  Climb back
up one last time and go into the pipe labled '4' in order to reach the
treasure chest on the bottom ledge below; there's an Affect All materia
lying within.  Walk against the right edge of the ledge to drop down
to the floor.

See the path heading south, just below the path that the boss is
blocking?  Follow it to go outside, then try to keep walking and you'll
drop down to the lower ledge.  Following the path here leads to a dead
end, so enter the cave instead and take the righthand path once you're
inside.  Ignore the exit at the other end of the cave and work your way
southwest, then go through the small hole.  Walk up, then left, then
down in order to reach the treasure chest you could see when you first
came in here.  Inside it is an Elixir.  Now go through the exit to
arrive at a wooded area.  On the ground, to the left of the mass of
crystalized Materia is an Attribute materia.  Take it and proceed north,
going through the opening to go back into the caves.

Inside, head to the right, then go up as far as you can and walk left
past the stone walls to reach a chest containing a Sniper CR.  Then
go back and take the rightmost passage.  It goes south and leads you
back to the outside.  From here, head left (going right leads you to
a dead end).  You'll eventually end up at the Jenova Plant you visited
in Cloud's flashback.  There's nothing to do inside the plant, so
continue beyond it to the door set in the rock wall.  Enter it and
you'll end up back in the chamber with the pipes again.

It's true that you could have taken the door and done this entire
sequence in reverse, but then you couldn't have scaled the ledge and
you would have to go all the way back, instead of taking the express
route like you just did :)  Now climb down and examine the boss, and
it will attack you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: MATERIAKIIPAA  <Materia Keeper>      LV: 38  HP: 8400  MP: 300

Don't use Honou-related attacks; it'll only heal him.  Red 13's Limit
Break B1/1 works well, as does Cloud's B2/1 Limit Break.  I'd also
suggest using the 'Chocobo and Moogle' materia as much as you can--it's
ability to stun this boss is very useful.  Physical attacks should do the
trick if you have good weapons; save your MPs for healing yourselves.
Kealra and Affect All Materia are a good combination (remember to link
them when selecting holders) if you want to stay alive, since the boss
can inflict 300-800 points of damage with its stabbing/mauling attacks.
Also, he can heal himself (around 1000 hp's worth), and use the damaging
Tryne skill, which causes about 500 points of damage to all those still
alive.  If Red's learned his B1/2 break or someone knows Haste, it would
be a wise idea to use it at the start of the round.  Since the Materia
Keeper is one of the few enemies that can use Tryne, it comes highly
recommended that you have a Techniques of the Enemy materia equipped so
that you can learn this enemy technqiue.  You'll get a Jewel Ring should
you be victorious.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle is over, examine the purple materia that is left behind
in order to take it (Counter).  Then follow the path outside--it leads
back to the World Map.


=========================================================================
r.  THE INVENTOR
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Power Up, Riku x syukichikou, Drill Arm, Ejinkooto.

Head southwest, then turn north (you're making a big C around the
mountains).  Keep walking and you'll see Rocket Town up ahead.  In
the Accessory Shop, you'll recieve a message if you go to the left end
of the counter and examine it (anyone know what it means?)  If you go
into the house farthest to the right, you can find a chest with a
Power Up inside of it in next to the stove.  Then talk to the old man
standing near the house that's just left of the rocket's launch pad.
Talk to him again, and he'll ask you a question.  Pick the top answer
and the view will pan up to show the rocket.  Then the old geezer will
give you the Riku x syukichikou; it's a weapon for Cloud.

Go into the house to the right of the old man.  This is the home of
Shiera and Cid, although neither of them are around at the moment.
There's a chest here with a Drill Arm inside it.  If you go out the
back entrance, you'll find a light airplane in the backyard--it's one
of Cid's inventions, the 'Tiny Bronco'.  After looking at the airplane,
Shiera will show up.  When she leaves, go outside and head north to
arrive at the rocket--climb inside it to find Cid.  After chatting with
him, name him.  You can then ask him several questions; you have to at
least ask the first one (top choice) in order to proceed with the game.
Then leave the rocket and return to Cid's house.  Shiera will show up,
then Cid, too.  After Cid goes out back, Shiera will explain how Cid
was going to pilot his rocket into outer space some time ago, but
aborted the launch when he discovered that Shiera was still making last-
minute checks and hadn't left the launch pad yet; she would be burned
to ashes since the launch could only be aborted, not delayed.  By saving
her life, Cid's dreams were shattered, since he did not have the
resources to repair the rocket, which tipped over after falling back
onto the lauch pad.

Cid comes back into the house, then Parumaa shows up--an employee of
Shinra.  Go outside and you'll run into Rufus and a Shinra guard, who
have come to 'borrow' the Tiny Bronco.  After Shiera brings you back
inside the house, go out the back entrance to find Parumaa standing
atop the Tiny Bronco.  Talk to him and he'll attack you.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: PARUMAA  <Palmer>                    LV: 38  HP: 6000  MP: 240

His gun causes a fair amount of damage since it has the effects of Faira,
Blizara, and Sandara, so make sure Aerith is in your party or that you
have some Recovery Materia.  Use Haste and Affect All on your party as
well as Slow magic and/or Summon Chocobo on him to even the odds a bit.
You'll want to have Cloud's B2/2 by now--it comes in handy.  Your prize
for beating Palmer is an Ejinkooto.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the boss gets wasted (heh, heh), your party and Cid will escape
on the Tiny Bronco.  Although it gets damaged during your escape it
can still be used to skim across shallow water and traverse rivers
(although you can't go up or down waterfalls).  Here are the airplane
controls:

X               Exit airplane
O               Enter airplane
Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
L2/R2           Change view


You now have several options that are available to you: you can get
Aerith's Level 4 Limit Break manual (see section 14 for details) or
go on Yuffie's sub-quest (if you have her in your party, see section
6 for further information).  Even if you don't have Yuffie, you can
purchase some pretty good weapons and find some treasure chests
lying around in Uutai, so you may want to stop there anyways.  You
can even go back and kill the big snake you had to flee from in
section 3k, if you've been itching to do so (you'll now have enough
HPs to learn the enemy skill 'Beta' from it without dying). In any
case, it would be a good idea to explore other areas and pick up items
you missed/buy stuff you couldn't afford before instead of continuing
on your quest just yet.  I would suggest checking out the excavators'
site to the north, since you can pick up the powerful 'Summon Kujata'
materia there as well as buy some useful bracelets and items (see
section 3u for details).


=========================================================================
s.  BETRAYAL
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Boudan Chokki, Chocobo Feather, Elixir.

Pilot the Tiny Bronco back to the Gold Saucer area.  Go to the
weaponsmith's house on the penninsula near the dirt pit and talk to
him--he'll explain that you need the Kiiston (Keystone), which he no
longer has.  Get back in Cid's airplane, and leave it on the shore by
the dirt pit.  You need to get to the Golden Saucer, so either walk or
find a wild Chocobo and ride it back to North Corel.  Then take the
sky lift up to the Gold Saucer.  Go to the Battle Square and look for
an opening on the right side of the room labled 'Dio's Show Room'.
Inside, examine the glittering object on top of the large stand; it's
the Kiiston.  Dio, the big lug who threw you out of the Gold Saucer
before, will show up and offer you a challenge: fight in the Battle
Square and he'll give you the Kiiston.  When you have a choice, pick
the top option to accept or the bottom option to temporarily decline.
You'll now have to fight in the Battle Square using only Cloud.  Keep
in mind that even if you lose the very first battle, Dio will still
give you the Kiiston.

If you want to try and see if you can win all the battles, then keep
fighting.  After each battle, the message 'GREAT!' will appear,
followed by two options.  Choose the right option to stop fighting,
or the left option to continue fighting.  If you choose to continue,
a jackpot-like device will appear.  You can stop it from spinning
by pressing the O button, and whatever comes up when you press O will
take affect prior to the start of the next battle.  Depening on what
you get, different things will happen to you, although certain
accessories can render you immune to some of the more debiliating
effects.

Furthermore, the status ailments that you are afflicted with as a
result of the jackpot stay with you from battle to battle, and you're
forced to stop the jackpot after each battle, so you could end up
being a poisoned, petrified frog in a few rounds, if you're not
careful.  If you last through seven battles, then the fighting ends.

Refer to the 'Having Fun' section for a complete explanation of how the
Battle Square works, but keep in mind that although you will earn
Battle Points during the battle, they are reset to zero when the battle
ends since you end up in the Show Room (and the way things work you lose
all the Battle Points you earn if you leave the main room at any time).
Should you make it through all the battles, Dio will give you a Boudan
Chokki and a Chocobo Feather, in addition to the Kiiston.

There's nothing else you need to do at the Gold Saucer now, but when
you try to leave, you'll discover that the ropeway that the sky lift
travels up and down is broken, leaving you stranded in the Saucer.
Cait Sith will either show up (or leave your party, if he's already
with you guys) and suggest that you all meet him at the Ghost Hotel.
At the Hotel, you and your allies will chat for awhile.  In the next
scence, you'll find yourself in your room.

At this point in the game, a character will come into your room and ask
to go on a date with you.  While it's usually Aerith, it's been
confirmed that you can go on a date with Tifa instead, if you were nice
to her and mean to Aerith throughout the course of the game.  It's much
harder to do, but if you have had Yuffie in your party for a while, she
may wish to date Cloud as well.  If you're really mean to all the women
in your party, Barett will date you (so be nice!)  It's not what you
think--just a friendly outing (he had a wife, so what are you thinking
^_^;)  I'll write down the exact method to date each character when I
learn what they are.

Both times that I've played through this part, it's always been Aerith
who comes to ask Cloud to go on a date, so I'll write the next section
with her in mind, although you may end up with someone else.

First, you'll go to the Event Square.  Since you're the 100th person
to come here that day, you and Aerith will be offered a role in the
upcoming play.  What you do here doesn't affect the game in any way,
so just pick whatever options you'd like and watch one of the many
humorous endings.  If I wrote it out, it would ruin the fun, so....
Next, you'll ride the gondola in the Round Square.  When Aerith looks
out the window, you can press left to look out, too, and see various
FMV sequences showcasing the events at the Gold Saucer.

After the date is over, Cloud and Aerith will return to the Station
Square only to find Cait Sith sneaking around with the Kiiston.  He'll
run away when Cloud yells at him, and you have to chase him around
various sections of the Gold Saucer.  (If you don't want to waste time
doing that, then go to the Chocobo Square, enter it, and chase Cait
Sith back outside).  Eventually, Cait will stop at the steps outside
of the Chocobo Square.  The Shinra helicopter shows up, and Cait will
toss the Kiiston up to Shon.  When confronted by Cloud and Aerith, Cait
reveals that he is in fact a spy for the Shinra.  He insists that he
continues to travel with Cloud and his friends because he has taken
Marin as a hostage back in Midgar (Right?  That's what he seems to say).

Once Cait Sith leaves, you'll find yourself back in the Ghost Hotel.
Check the iron maiden for an Elixir (notice the sound it makes; it
sounds just like Norstein Bekkler's laugh [the guy from Chrono
Trigger!]).  Leave the room to meet up with your allies again.  After
a brief talk, Aerith will join your party, becoming a permanent member.
Pick another ally and then leave the Saucer, since the ropeway is now
repaired.

Now that you're back at North Corel, leave and return where you parked
the Tiny Bronco.  Look at the World Map.  See the tiny chain of islands
near the bottom of the map?  Just to the right of them and to the left
of Mideel and the Condor Fort is a large island.  If you go there, you'll
see a large temple surrounded by a forest.  This is your next
destination, so land the Tiny Bronco at the shore and head to the temple.


=========================================================================
t.  THE TEMPLE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Trident, Mind Up, Silver Jewel Gun, Ether Turbo x2,
                     Rocket Punch, Lucky materia, Metamorphosis materia,
                     Princess Guard, Ribbon, Hou xx, Last Elixir, Nail
                     Bat, Dragon Bracelet, 'Summon Bahamut' materia,
                     Gigas Bracelet.

At the top of the temple is a black creature, similar to the ones you
met in Nivelheim.  If you talk to it, it floats into the air in a flash
of light.  Inside the temple, you'll find the Turk, Shon.  He was badly
wounded by Sephiroth.  He gives you the Kiiston so that you can go after
his attacker; examine the dais in the center of the room and you'll be
transported into the depths of the temple.

This area has a very confusing layout; it's a mass of stairs, walkways
and passages.  There are chests everywhere, and a kooky old man in a
blue robe is also running around down here.  From where you arrived,
head up, then left, then up again and go down the stairs to the ground
level.  There's an opening just above you; go in it, turn to the right,
then climb down the vines clinging to the wall beneath you.  If you
run underneath the long staircase nearby, you can reach a treasure chest
that has a Trident inside of it.  From there, head right, go down the
stairs, then turn and climb up the wall using the vines.  Head past the
opening (which you can't enter at this point, anyway) and go up the
stairs.  The old man will dash away; ignore him for now and climb up the
vines to reach a platform.  There's a shiny pink item here (Mind Up).
Take it and go down the stairs, then enter the door to your left to find
a room with a treasure chest and the old man.  Inside the chest is the
Silver Jewel Gun.  Talk to the geezer twice and he'll offer his services
to you:

 - Purchase Items
 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game*
 - Nothing

*  Choose the top option to decline or the bottom option to accept and
   save your game.

Outside, go back up the stairs and down the vines, but this time, head
down and to the left.  You can pick up a green item here (Ether Turbo).
Then go down the long stairway.  At the bottom, climb down the smaller
set of steps to your left, then work your way towards the southwest
corner of the screen.  Ther's a small patch of vines here that you can
climb down.  Be sure to open the nearby chest; there's a Rocket Punch
inside of it.  Now, go down the stairs and walk northeast along the
path to find some more vines and the old man, who scampers away when
you get too close.  Climb up the vines, then go up the stairs next to
you, go through the archway, turn east and go down the stairs, and
climb up the long stretch of vines on the nearby wall.  Head left,
underneath the staircase, and you can nab a purple materia (Lucky).

Now, go back the way you came (go right, down the vines, up the stairs
and down and out through the archway so that you're back on the path
that the old man was standing on, just above the vines).  Walk to the
east until the path stops, then head south and turn east again to enter
the nearby door.  As you enter, the old man will dash away.  There are
huge hollow boulders that are rolling down this walkway.  To get past
them, time your dashes so that the hollow part will be directly over
you, causing Cloud to kneel as the boulder rolls over you.  Then keep
going until you reach a side path that leads to a pool of water.  Grab
the Metamorphosis materia near the pool, then continue along the
walkway, avoiding the boulders.  Once you reach the end of the path,
they'll disappear for good, but remember that if you get hit by a
boulder, you'll be dragged all the way back to the beginning of the
path (ouch!)  Alternately, you can wait until the boulders disppear and
then go back and pick up the materia after the sequnce with Sephiroth.

Once the boulders are gone, Aerith will sense a powerful prescence in
the chamber and return to the pool.  Light will erupt from the surface
of the pool, and you'll be able to see what I presume is a flashback of
Shon and Iriina (both Turks) running around in the shrine.  After Iriina
leaves, Sephiroth shows up and creates a double of himself.  While he
busies himself with attacking Shon, the laughing double flies up into
the air.  After this sequence is over, Sephiroth's double will descend
into the pool and then fly away (is this supposed to mean anything?)
When you return to the end of the passage, the old geezer will be
waiting for you, and will once again offer his help:

 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game
 - Nothing

When you're ready, go down the stairs.  There's a huge room here with
twelve doors labeled I to XII.  In the center of the room is the ever-
annoying talking clock.  I was ready to use my FF7 discs as frisbees
by the time I figured out how to solve this little 'mini-game'.  Here's
how it works:

If you press O (Roulette), the hour and minute hands move around very
quickly.  Even when you press O again to stop the hands, they'll both
move three more spaces in the direction they were traveling.

If you press T, you're given two options: one in blue, one in green:

        BLUE:  This gives you four _more_ options, one in blue, one
               in green, one in red, and one in white.

                - BLUE   The hour hand moves ahead by one space.
                - GREEN  The hour hand moves ahead seven spaces.
                - RED    The hour hand moves ahead by 17 spaces.
                         This invariably sets the minute hand ahead
                         by at least one space.
                - WHITE  This does nothing.

       GREEN:   This gives you _another_ four options, in blue,
                green, red, and white, respectively.

                - BLUE   The hour hand moves back by two spaces.
                - GREEN  The hour hand moves back by ten spaces,
                         setting the minute hand back by one.
                - RED    The hour hand moves back by 20 spaces.
                         This makes the minute hand decrease
                         by at least one space, too.
                - WHITE  This does nothing.

If you press X, the damn clock shuts up and you're free to move onto
the hands of the clock (providing you've aligned them properly).  You
can only walk on the hour and minute hands of the clock.

Isn't this fun?  Well, there are twelve passages (labeled I to XII),
and you get to explore them by setting the clock to various positions.
Here's a list of what's in each passage:

        I       -  When you open up the chest, you'll be attacked by
                   monsters.  You won't get anything for beating them,
                   either.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Poison Frogs are weak against Reiki, so use cold-based attacks/spells
on them.  Their attacks will turn you into a frog, but they attack so
often that it's better for you to wait until they hit you again (turning
you back into a human) instead of wasting a Virgin's Kiss or other
restorative item.  The woman (Jeminisumii) is weak against Poison, so
use one of the Bio spells on her for good results.  The only point in
fighting this battle is if you want to learn Song of the Frog from the
frogs (providing you have a Techniques of the Enemy materia equipped).

        II      -  This passage is blocked off by rocks.  You can't
                   do anything here, so return and pick another path.

        III     -  A treasure chest.  It contains monsters, too.
                   You won't get anything for defeating them.

TIPS:  HEKUTOAIZU  <Hecto-Eyes>                  LV: 30  HP: 500  MP: 220
       HEKUTOAIZU  <Hecto-Eyes>                  LV: 30  HP: 500  MP: 220

Both of these red, multi-eyed monsters are weak against Poison, so use
the best Bio spell you've got, or simply attack to dispatch them.  If
you've got Metamorphosis equipped, you can morph both of them into
Magic Up items, which is really the only point in fighting this battle.
Although weak, either enemy can drain _lots_ of HP from you (around 1200-
1400 points!)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

        IIII    -  Shouldn't this be IV?  Anyway, there's a chest
                   here, and Aerith's Ultimate Weapon, the
                   Princess Guard is inside.

        V       -  This passage leads outside to the gold chest you
                   could see but not normally reach.  Inside it is
                   a Ribbon.

        VI      -  Read below to find out what to do here.

        VII     -  There's a chest here.  A weapon for Cait Sith,
                   the Hou xx, is inside it.

        VIII    -  You can get a Last Elixir from the chest in
                   this room.

        IX      -  A passage blocked by fallen rock.

        X       -  This is where you came in, bud!

        XI      -  Yet another blocked passage.

        XII     -  What a creepy room!  You'll be seeing more of
                   it soon enough.

At some point, you should stand on the hour or minute hand and let the
second hand approach.  When it passes over you, it will knock you down
into the pit below.  When you land, you'll find yourself in a room with
a treasure chest.  Before you can open it, you'll be ambushed by two
monsters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: ENSHYANTODORAGON  <Ancient Dragon>   LV: 34  HP: 2400  MP: 450
           ENSHYANTODORGAON  <Ancient Dragon>   LV: 34  HP: 2400  MP: 450
                                                (weak against Gravity)

Using Gravity or some Summon Materia will kill these dragons quickly.
Even physical attacks work well.  Either enemy can only attack for about
500 points of damage, or use a Sazankurosu (Southern Cross) attack that
hit's one enemy for the same amount of damage, so they don't pose too
serious a threat.  You can also control them, even though they're bosses.
You'll win an Ether Turbo for defeating both of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the chest is the Nail Bat, the strongest weapon Cloud can get during
Disc 1.  Take it and leave the room.  You'll find yourself back at the
door you couldn't enter earlier (in the area with the vines and
staircases.  Simply work your way back to the talking clock, and pick
up any items you might have missed the first time around.

PASSAGE VI
Before going down this passage, make sure you've cleared out the other
rooms since you won't be able to go back to them after the next event.
When you step out into the open, the bouncing old man will see you and
run away.  When Aerith asks you a question, pick the bottom answer if
you want to return and explore more of the clock puzzle room (NSS), or
choose the top answer if you want to hunt down the old man.  To find
him, simply go through the passages; you want to end up going into a
passage that he plans to come out of.  You can go down to another set
of passages by going to the left end of each ledge and pressing the O
button to jump down a level.  The passage entrances and exits are
random, but you can catch him without too much difficulty.  Don't forget
to take the chest lying on the lowest level; there's a pair of Army
Cotton Gloves inside.  As usual, beat the old man at his own game and
he'll help you in return:

 - Restore HP and MP to maximum
 - Save your game
 - Nothing

Now that you've caught the old man, the large door on the top level will
open.  Go inside and head to the right.  You'll encoutner Sephiroth four
times.  Up to his usual evil, Sephiroth talks about the energy within
the temple as he as swings his sword around, his every motion trailed by
the double that he made earlier.  After disappearing, Cloud will suffer
from some sort of fit (something about the Materia taking over his body?)
After coming to his senses, the party examines a mural on the wall which
shows a meteorite speeding towards the people of the earth.  Aerith talks
about the spell 'Meteo' which Sephiroth is planning to cast, when the
party hears Sephiroth's voice.  The temple starts to shake, and a large
red dragon appears and attacks the allies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: REDDODORAGON  <Red Dragon>           LV: 39  HP: 6800  MP: 300

Slow the dragon and Haste yourself to gain the upper hand.  Some Summon
Materia will also even the odds, but don't use Kujata since it will heal
the boss by about 2100 points.  Also, Gravity won't work against it.
Limit Breaks and physical attacks should do the trick.  You'll win a
Dragon Bracelet should you win the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick up the summon materia that's left behind (Bahamut).  Then go back
and examine the floating gold object on the dais.  Aerith refers to it
as the 'Kuro Materia' (Black Materia) but it's _gold_...in any case,
Aerith will then ask you a question.  It doesn't matter which answer
you choose.  At this point, if Cait Sith isn't in your party, you'll
here a ringing sound and Cloud will answer the PHS phone.  Cait will
talk to him through the phone.  If he is in you party, then he starts
hopping around and talking to you.  When he finishes, leave this
chamber, let the old man heal you if you need it, then go back to the
clock room.  The only direction you can go in is straight up through
passage XII.  When you examine the door in the room beyond, yet another
boss appears to finish you off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS:  DEMONZUGEITO  <Demon's Gate>       LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 400

The bad news is that the boss can hit for lots of damage.  The good news
is that most of his attacks (especially the earthquake and body slam
attack) quickly max out your Limit bars.  Now's a good time to try out
the Bahamut materia, but most other Summon materia don't do much damage.
Make good use of Aerith's B1/1 and Cloud's B2/2, and you'll want to
Barrier and Haste yourselves.  Luckily, this boss can't instantly kill
you as a similar boss in FF2 could.  You'll win a Gigas Bracelet from
this boss if you're victorious.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the boss is defeated, Cait Sith will have an animated conversation
with your party.  If he's not in your group, then he bursts out of the
door and starts talking.  He'll then return to the chamber where the
Black Materia was and take it.  Afterwards, the entire temple vanishes!
In the following scene, Cloud and Aerith go down into the foundation
of the temple and retrieve the Black Materia, but Sephiroth shows up
and forces Cloud to give the Materia to him.  During this time, you
control a ghostly image of Cloud as a child.  If you stand in Cloud's
path and keep talking to him, you'll prevent him from approaching
Sephiroth, but there's no point in doing this since Cloud will continue
to advance until you give up.  After Cloud gives Sephiroth the Black
Materia, he will attack Aerith (and you can't do anything about that,
either).  Cait Sith will show up (actually Cait Sith 2--the same person,
but with a new robot body since the first one got trashed when the
temple was destroyed.  He sure got there fast, huh?)  Then your other
party member will leap down and prevent Cloud from killing Aerith.

After what I take to be a dream sequence, you'll awake in, of all
places, the inn at Gongaga Town, with Barett and Tifa by your side.
Answer Barett's question any way you like, then go outside.  Tifa and
Barett will join your party, but you don't have to keep them as
permanent members.  Look for the Tiny Bronco on the southern shore near
Gongaga Town.

Also, Aerith has left your party for good.  However, you'll have all of
her weapons, equipment, accessories and materia in your item menu.  Now,
you need to go to the forest that you saw in Cloud's dream.  First, get
in the Tiny Bronco.


=========================================================================
u.  EXCAVATORS' SITE / THE FOREST
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  'Summon Kujata' materia, Water Ring.

Make your way up to the Northern Continent by going around the left side
of the Western Continent after going along the river by the Gold Saucer.

Head to the right edge of the continent, where you'll find a forest
surrounded by mountains.  In the middle of the forest is a big rib cage
and a large skull.  Approach it, and you'll find yourself in a excavation
site where a bunch of archaeologists spend their time digging.  Before
doing anything else, you might want to head up the ladder and go through
the hole in the back to reach a forest, the same one from Cloud's dream.
Keep walking until you reach the second forest screen.  If you stand here
for a moment, you'll see a red Materia floating on the left side of the
screen.  It will switch to the right side and back again every few
seconds.  Try to predict where it will show up and use the O button to
grab it.  Your reward is the Summon Kujata materia.  If you try to
continue through the forest, you'll find that this screen repeats
endlessly.  So, go back outside.  Before going on to the next part of
the game, you may want to buy some bracelets and items; talk to the
man sitting near the rib cage and pick the second option in order to
buy things from him.

What you need to do at this point in the game is comission one of the
men to dig up the Runahaapu (Luna Harp) for you.  As long as you have
it in your possession, you're able to pass through the 'endless'
forest.

 - First, talk to the man sitting just outside of the rib-cage room.
   Pick the first option twice*.  The screen will fade out.

 - When the screen fades back in, all the men will be gone.  What you
   do is choose a place where you want a digger to stand and press the
   S button.  It costs 100 gil to place a digger.  Use the top option
   to place a digger, or the bottom option to quit.  You can place up
   to five diggers.

 - You'll quit once you choose the bottom option or after you've placed
   five diggers.  Now, press the S button to set off an explosion.
   You'll hear a music cue, and the diggers will turn in different
   directions.

 - Stand where you want one of the diggers to search through the night
   and press S again after clearing the dialogue box.  You'll find
   yourself back at the bottom of the screen the next morning.  The
   treasure chest nearby will be closed, and it may or may not hold an
   item, depending on where you chose to dig.

 - The key to getting the right item is to watch the diggers after the
   explosion occurs.  They'll all look toward the location of the item
   you need, so try placing them in compass-point style layout so that
   you can follow their vision to the place where the item lies.  If
   you're really stuck, the Runahaapo lies just a little ways to the
   west and ever so slightly south of the tent on the upper ledge.

*  Normally, the first option is used to dig for the Runahaapu (all
   the diggers will look in the direction of the harp).  The other
   two options are used to dig up other items (the diggers will look
   in the direction of the closest item/next item to be found).  But
   not only do you not have to place diggers in order to find an item,
   but you can use any of the three choice to dig up the Runahaapu or
   any other item--it's just that the diggers won't look in the correct
   direction if you don't use the first option, and you can't use the
   first option after obtaining the Runahaapu.

How do you know if you got the right item?  Well, it will show up on the
Key Item menu (where the important stuff like the PHS is kept).  Also, if
you talk to the digger sitting by the room, and choose the first option
twice, he won't let you select and place diggers.  Finally, try going
into the forest.  If the screen turns green, then you've got the right
item.

When you've got Runahaapu, go into the forest.  When you reach the second
area, the screen changes to a green color, and the forest will no longer
repeat.  Beyond the forest is a rocky area.  First, go under the tree
trunk to reach the treasure chest with a Water Ring inside.  Climb up the
rocks near the pink mass of coral, then go through the fallen trunk and
head north to reach the next area (you can't climb up the vine in the
first area, so ignore it).  Walk along the curving path and you'll find
yourself back in the World Map, in the canyon near the forest.  Head
straight forward to the top-like object to continue your quest.


=========================================================================
v.  ANCIENT CITY
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Magic Up, Aurora Bracelet, Meteorite materia, Guard
                     Up, Elixir, Techniques of the Enemy materia, Wizard
                     Brace.

This area looks a lot like the floor of the sea; there's shells and coral
everywhere.  At the crossroads, take the left path.  It leads to a stone
building--inisde of the building is a Save Point, and there's a chest on
the upper ledge with a Magic Up inside it.  Leave the building and
continue past it, following the path east into the rock face.  Inside,
go down the stairs and head all the way right to find a chest with an
Aurora Bracelet in it.  You can check out the blue crystal if you want,
but there's nothing you can do with it at this point in the game.  Return
to the crossroads and take the middle path.  Enter the shell building and
climb the spiraling walkway to the very to to find a green materia lying
on the ground (Meteorite).  Go back to the crossroads yet again and take
the right road.  It leads to an area with several shell buildings.  Go
all the way to the right, then go north to enter the building before you.
Climb all the way to the top level.  There's a chest here containing a
Guard Up.

There's nothing else to do in this area but enter the last shell house;
your friends won't let you take the path leading out of the city, and
the main path leads to another part of the chamber with the blue crystal,
but there's nothing you can do there.  So, if you're ready to proceed,
enter the shell house to the right of the main path.  On the ground
floor is a chest holding an Elixir.  Take it and climb up the ladder.
When you approach the beds, you'll be given an option.  You can choose
the bottom option, grab the yellow materia behind the headboard of the
third bed (Techniques of the Enemy), exit the house, then enter it again,
approach the beds, and choose the top option to go to sleep.  Or, you can
just pick the top option the first time around, go to sleep, and when you
wake up in the night, grab the materia (it's easier to see at night, too).
Originally, I though this was a 'bug' materia (don't I feel silly now),
but it's not.

No matter what you decide to do, go to sleep when you're ready to.
You'll wake up in the middle of the night.  After Cloud's companions join
him, return to the crossroads a final time and take the middle path again.
When you enter the shell building, the fish floating in the middle of the
spiraling passageway will have disappeared; there are blue steps in it's
place.  Go down them and you'll find yourself in an underwater palace.
At the bottom of the stairs, leave the building and take note of the Save
Point before going down both sets of stairs below.

Aerith's here, and you have to get to her by jumping across several
pillars.  Press in the direction of the next pillar to get proceed,
but you'll have to use just Cloud; your allies will wait for you back
on the ground.  Once you get close to Aerith, Cloud has another spastic
fit and will draw his sword.  You can press the controller and the
buttons to make Cloud do different things, but pressing O three times
will make him try to strike Aerith.  Luckily, he'll come to his senses
beforehand with some help from his friends, but Sephiroth makes an
appearance and attacks Aerith.  After her death, Sephiroth escapes,
leaving behind another monster in his wake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*LIFE  <Jenova*Life>          LV: 50  HP: 10000  MP: 300

This boss is weak against earth attacks, so use Earth and Titan.  Also,
Meteorite, Bahamut, and Kujata all work very well.  Physical attacks do a
surprising amount of damage.  The boss will cast Reflect on itself the
first time you cast a spell on it, so be wary about using spells too
often.  Jenova*Life's attacks are not that strong (about 400-700 points),
but it has an ultra-deadly blue bubble attack (Aqua Breath) that inflicts
+1500 damage to each character.  Be sure to have some Recovery Materia
handy.  Considering it's the last boss on this disc, this is not a very
hard battle.  You'll get a Wizard Brace when you win the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After beating the boss, there's another FMV sequence, then you're given
the option to save your game.  Guess what?  You just finished Disc One!
My times (if you're interested, and even if you're not :)) were 29:04
initially, and 25:20 for the rewrite.


                       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                        4. WALKTHROUGH - DISC TWO
                       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=========================================================================
a.  THE CAVE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Serpent Halberd, Thunder Bracelet, Hypno-Crown,
                     Last Elixir, Magical materia, Power Up.

You'll start off outside of one of the shell-shaped buildings on the east
side of the Ancient City.  If you walk to the left, Cloud will have
another attack and you'll see the ghostly form of Sephiroth leaving the
Ancient City.  Once Cloud has recovered, follow Sephiroth by heading
north, then east along the path you couldn't take before.  Note that
you're free to go back through the Forest and return to the World Map,
but there's no point in doing so unless you wanted to buy some items or
find Vincent or Yuffie (unless you already have them).  Although you're
now on Disc 2, none of the other events that occur in this disc will
actually happen until you get the Highwind in section 4e (meaning that if
you were to return to the World Map, you couldn't go on the Huge materia
quests yet, dig up the Gate 5 Key, or bring Buugen Haagen back to the
Ancient City).

In the next area, ignore the white, spiked object for a moment.  Instead,
walk behind it (look for a path to your left).  This will allow you to
reach a chest containing a Serpent Halberd (a weapon for Cid).  Once
you've gotten it, climb up the spiky object.  It's a little tricky to
navigate due to it's spiraling shape, but you'll eventually reach a
cave entrace after making your way to the top.

Inside, walk to the left and press against the second cleft in the wall.
You'll climb to the top and be given two options (Right or Left).  Pick
the bottom option (Left).  Walk over to the next cleft and climb up it,
then choose the bottom option when you reach the top to land on a litte
ledge with a chest above it.  You can open the chest from where you are;
there's a Thunder Bracelet inside.  Face the cleft and choose the bottom
choice, then the top one to jump to the other side.  Now, go to the right
and when two options appear, pick the bottom one.  This lets you climb
down to where the first chest is; there's a Hypno-Crown inside of it.
Climb back up to the top of the cleft, pick the bottom option, then press
against it to try and get back on.  When two optoins appear, choose the
top one.  Then, make your way up to the ledge with the chest, and pick
the top option.  You can now take the Last Elixir from inside the chest.
Get back into the cleft and choose the bottom option to jump to the west
side of the path.  Work your way to the left, climb up the cleft, and
head left a second time to reach a long ladder.  Selecting the bottom
option will left you climb down to the bottom of the ladder.

If you search using the O button, you'll find a purple materia (Magical)
near the lower-left corner of the screen.  When you approach the ladder,
you'll automatically climb up to the ledge you were at.  Now pick the top
option after nearing the ladder and climb all the way to the top.  Once
you're off the ladder, run to the right and go through the opening on the
north wall.  In the next room, take the contents of the treasure chest
(Power Up) before exiting through the far opening to the northwest.

Once outside, keep to the east.  After heading along the coastline
for a while, you'll come across a sharp curve that turns to the west.
Just beyond it is a village and a deep valley, which you can't enter
without exploring the village (Icicle Lodge) first.


=========================================================================
b.  ICICLE LODGE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  X Potion, Ei x no Kusuri, Vaccine, Ether Turbo.

Go to the far end of town and talk to the man in purple standing near
the trees.  Pick the top option.  Two Shin-Ra members will show up, along
with Iriina (a Turk).  After confronting Cloud, she will try to knock him
out.  To avoid her strike, press left just after you see the transparent
message box.  If she does hit you, you'll wake up in one of the houses,
but if she doesn't, then she'll roll right out of the town.  It doesn't
make a difference whether you get hit or not.

After that's done with, go to town entrance and check out the house
that's just to your right.  In the back room, there's a boy, a cat,
and a snowboard.  Talk to the boy and the cat will leave the room,
enabling you to take the snowboard by examining it.  You'll need it for
the upcoming event.  Now, go to the inn, head to the upper floor, and
examine the window in the lower left-hand corner to get an X Potion.
Leave and enter the house on the far right (near the snowman).  Take
the items in the back room (an Ei x no Kusuri and a Vaccine), then
examine the map on the wall in the main room.  You can examine it by
choosing the top option, but before you leave, you'll want to choose
the bottom option to take it.

Finally, go into the house on the left side of town, just to the right
of the weapons shop.  If Iriina KO'd you, this is where you'll wake
up :)  If you go down the stairs and look by the windowsill, you can
get another item (Ether Turbo).   You can also take a look at the
machinery on the ground floor to see a series of pre-recorded videos
dating back many years ago; they show Aerith's mother (Ifaruna, a Setora
just like Aerith) and her father, a 'renegade' Shin-Ra scientist named
Gasuto (Gast).  There are several videos, but watching them has no
effect on the game itself, aside from cluing you in to Aerith's past
(providing you can read it :))  There's a device to the left that will
allow more light into the room, but it doesn't seem to have any purpose
(NSS).

Before you leave the town, you may want to buy weapons, Hi Potions
and Tents at the shop.  When you're ready to go, simply walk past the
man in the back of town (the one near the trees), and the snowboard
sequence will start up:

Your controls while using the snowboard are:

S               Brake
X               Jump
Pad             Move left or right, down to brake
Start           Pause/unpause
L1/R1           Quick turn to the left or right when used
                with control pad

Basically, you want to make your way through the mountains.  You can
collect balloons along the way, but I don't know what they do for you.
There are also obstacles to crash into, like dead wood, pine trees,
igloos, moogles, snowmen, rocks, ice boulders, and chocobos.  I believe
there are four different 'exit' paths; I'll take the left path twice
and go from there in this FAQ.

My characters came to in a white forest.  Did yours?  From this point
onward, you can press S to look at the map you took (but not in some
screens), which shows where you need to go but not where you are.  I
spent hours trying to map this place out, only to discover that there's
almost nothing of interest in this area.  So, I've simply described each
location and where it is on the map; getting there isn't much of a
problem.  Your ultimate goal, BTW, is to make it to the red check mark
shown on the map.

The locations are:

ENTRANCE  (looks like a square at the bottom-center of the screen)
Heading south from this area takes you back out to the World Map.  If
you return to Icicle Lodge to heal yourself, you'll have to snowboard
in here again.

MOUNTAIN CAVE  (small opening just to the right of the ENTRANCE)
You can hop across the ledges to the top of the screen, but in the next
room, there's nothing to do but choose to fall/not fall down an icy
chute that has no effect aside from ejecting you back into the world
map.  The entrance to this cave is hard to see; it's in the lower-right
area of the T-junction screen.  You can also get here by going right
from the LAKE CAVE area.

FOREST  (forest divided by Y-shaped paths)
In the main forest screen, there's an item (Mind Up) at the foot of a
tree near the upper left part of the screen.  If this is where you
landed after the snowboarding event, then it's just up and to the right
of where you crashed.

BURIED AIRPLANE  (tail of plane sticking out to left of forest)
Nothing here.

LAKE CAVE  (cave in the middle of the central lake)
On the surface of the frozen lake, near the shore, there is a green
item (a Potion).  Be sure to get it.  Then head to the left to reach
a screen full of ice floes.  Here, you'll have to jump on the floating
ice chunks to get across, but the chunks surrounding the one you're
currently standing on will submerge or raise depending on how they
looked when you arrived there.  If you mess up and they are all
submerged, you'll have to start all over.  The key is to make sure that
you're not jumping onto a floe when the ones surrounding it are all
raised, or else they'll all submerge and you'll fall into the water.
To get on the ice floats, choose the top option, then use the O button
and the controller to jump around.  Enter the cave in the next area,
grab the item bag (it contains a Safety Bit accessory), and leave.

LONE TREE  (pine tree up and right from the LAKE CAVE)
Nothing here, either.

ICE BOULDERS  (northwest corner, left and below the STONE FACE)
Go into the small cave entrance and grab the item in the northwest
corner of the cavern (an Elixir), then go out the other entrance.

RIVER LOG  (above central lake, at mouth of river)
There's nothing here.

STONE FACE  (left of the red check mark)
Nothing here.  Seem familiar?  The stone face has also appeared in
Secret of Mana and FF5j.

STEAMING LAKES  (south and east of the check mark)
You can touch the water on the lefthand bank if you want.  In fact,
you should, since you can't get the Alexander Materia any other way.
(Keep reading for details.) Just maneuver yourself as close to the
shore of the left lake as you can, and when an option appears, pick
the top one.

MOUNTAIN CROSSROADS  (top of mountain east of the STEAMING LAKES)
Once you reach the crossroads (da dum da da :))  head to the upper
right corner of the screen to go off the map.  In the next area,
work your way up and to the left.  When this screen repeats a second
time, look for a Blue Materia (Slice in Addition) near the beginning
of the screen, in the upper-right part of the path.  This road takes
you to the Steaming Lakes area, but if you try to back the way you
came, you'll see that the screen has changed.  Put another way, you
couldn't have gotten the Materia unless you took this path since the
'switching' road isn't marked on the map.

If you're fast, you can reach the 'lost in the snowfield' section (the
red checkmark) before anything bad happens.  But if you waste your time
in this area, you'll pass out.  (This will still happen to you even if
you reached the snowfield, but then returned to any part of the 'first
area'.  If that happens, go to the next section.  If you made it to the
snowfield area, then skip the first paragraph to find out where you are.

Personally, my suggestion is that you follow the example in the FAQ
and take the left path twice so that you land in the Forest.  From
there, you can go right to the Lake Cave area, then continue right
past the Mountain Cave area (the T-junction), and up into the Mountain
Crossroads, where you can take the switching path to the Steaming
Lakes, and then head left into the snowfield.  Not only is this a
fast way to get through this area, but it also lets you pick up all
the items along the way and get the Alexander Materia later on (since
you touched the lake on your way out).

Also, you'll start off at the bottom end of the snowfield when you first
get there, so you can just head up to the cave to get the Blue Materia,
then keep heading north to reach the old man's shack (if you're in need
of healing and a Save Point).  After talking with him, you can go to the
Stone Face Area, head south to the Ice Boulders area where an Elixir is,
then backtrack to the snowfield and go to the right in order to get the
Alexander Materia before returning to the shack.  Voila!  You've just
cleared out this _entire_ area in only a few minutes!

Remember, you _will_ pass out eventually if you return to the first
area--there's nothing you can do about it, even if you've already
gone to Horuzofu's shack.  If you don't want to waste too much time
backtracking just run around in the same few areas until it happens,
then leave the old man's shack and continue exploring.  Why this still
happens to you after clearing out this area doesn't seem to make much
sense, as it's more of a nuisance than anything else, but there's not
much you can do about it.  If you return to the first area after
falling unconsious and wait around there again, you'll pass out a
second time.  In fact, this will always happen to you, so get moving!


=========================================================================
c.  LOST IN THE SNOW
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Affect All Materia, Sacred, Alexander Materia.

You'll awake in the house of an old man (Horuzofu).  Go up the stairs
and let the old man talk to you; choose the bottom option twice when he
asks you two questions.  When you wake up the next morning, check out
the Save Point (since you probably haven't saved prior to entering the
Icicle Lodge).  If you want to spend the night again, talk to the old
man in the first room and choose the top choice.  When you leave the
shack, your friends will be waiting outside.  Make a new party if you
wish, (see below for directions) then head south.  You may have noticed
that you can talk to the man from the ground floor even though he is
above you :)

If you _didn't_ pass out, then go directly to the shack so that you
won't pass out.  There, you'll meet an old hermit named Horuzofu.
Talk to him, and when he asks you a question, answer any way you like.
The second time he asks you a question, choose the bottom reply.
You'll spend the night at his shack, and when you leave the next
morning, your allies will be standing around outside.  Choose either
choice when an option appears.  Then talk to any member and pick the
top option to accept a party change or the bottom option to decline,
if you want to change your members.

If you don't want to explore the snowfield any more, skip to section d.
After all, you can return here at any future point in the game,
providing you have the Highwind.

Outside, you'll be in a large snowfield.  Use the O button to set down
spikes that you can use to track your location (since your direction
changes when the wind picks up).  If you want to explore the rest of
that first area that you left/passed out in, head south.  When you leave
the first area from the Steaming Lakes exit, you'll see a rock formation
with a cave entrance if you keep walking north.  Inside, a Blue Materia
(Affect All) is lying near the tent.  What's odd is that you seem to
always run into this on your way back from the first area instead of on
the way to it (i.e. from the old man's shack).

If you head east, you'll go through some snowy areas, then arrive at a
cave entrance.  Talk to the purple fellow inside to enter a battle, but
only if you touched the water back at the Steaming Lakes.

BOSS TIPS: SUNOU  <Snow>                        LV: 32  HP: 4000  MP: 160
                                                (weak against Flame)

You can't Control or Metamorphosis her, but you can steal a Saakuretto
(Sacred) during the battle.  Her cold-based attacks (Cold Breath and
Blizzard 2) are nothing to worry about, but be careful if she charms
one of your own members.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are victorious, she'll disappear and a Summon Materia (Alexander)
will drop to the floor, so don't miss it.  While you can use the map here,
you can't reach this place normally from the first area.  If you go right,
then down the snowy path, you'll end up at the 'switching' crossroads in
the first area, though (sort of like a one-way path).

Going west from the snowfield takes you to an alternate entrance to the
first area.  There's not that much to do there, anyway, unless you want
a shortcut to the ICE BOULDERS area where an item is lying in a cave
(refer to the previous section for more information).

If you're really having trouble navigating around, think of the
snowfield like this:

                 First Area (Steaming Lakes)

So no matter how far you are along a boundary, you'll still enter that
area when you hit it.  The same applies to the corners -- you'll hit
one boundary or the other, so going in a diagonal direction won't get
you to a new place.  Don't worry about finding an 'exact' spot to enter
an area, just head in that direction.  The only real landmark is the
cave with the Affect All materia, but if you head north from the
Steaming Lakes exit, you're bound to spot it.


=========================================================================
d.  THE CRATER / TORNADO LABYRINTH
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Ribbon, Javelin, Elixir, Ardent Flame Bracelet,
                    Last Elixir, Speed Up, Enhance Sword, Fang of
                    Dragon Pair, Bahamut Reborn, Ether, Hi Potion,
                    Kaiser Knuckle, Reflect Ring, MP Turbo materia,
                    Poison Ring.

Once you've had your fun in the snowfield, return to the old man's
house and heal up or save your game if you need to.  Then, go north
from the shack to arrive at the slopes of a icy mountain.  Keep in
mind that you can't explore this area at any time other than right
now in Disc 2, so make sure to get all the items and other stuff.

Now, get ready for some finger-smashing fun!  the meter that appears on
screen when you're outside is your body temperature (the kanji you see
by the numbers, 'do' actually means 'degrees'): it goes down because of
the cold climate.  To keep your temperature up, you need to rapidly hit
the S button.  The highest temperature you can get to is 38, while the
lowest is 27.  Any less than that (26), and you pass out and find
yourself back in the old man's house.  It sounds like keeping your heat
up is easy, but you can only increase it when you're on one of the
ledges, not while you're climbing up the rock face.  So for those long
climbs, you have to max out your heat and climb as quickly as you can.
Luckily, your heat doesn't go down during a battle. Remember, it's not
how hard you press the S button, but how fast you press it, so try to
get in as many presses as you can to max out your temperature.  If you'd
rather cheat, refer to the Game Shark code section in the second part
of this FAQ--one of my 'fix-all' codes is in there that will give you a
high body heat no matter how long you stand around.

In this area, there's nowhere else to go but up, so climb along the
rock face until you arrive at the cave entrance, pausing at each ledge
to restore your body heat.  Always keep an eye out for the red flags;
they indicate which part of the wall you can climb.  Inside, go through
the two archways into the next cavern.  Here, climb up the stairs and
go through the south exit.  In the adjoining area, walk all the way to
the right to find a hidden chamber with a chest; inside it is a Ribbon.
Then return to the main path and head north, then west, through the
entrance.  Cross the icy bridge in the third cavern and press the
SELECT button to bring up the cursor; it'll help you navigate through
the twsiting passage before you.  Once you reach the top, examine the
boulder and choose the top option when it presents itself.  This will
make you push the boulder and free up the blocked passage beneath you.
You can still move while the boulder is rolling--notice that you can
stand right where it falls and you will recieve no damage (then again,
Cloud is the same guy who can run around in the cold wearing a
sleeveless shirt and not die of hypothermia...must be those corn
flakes).

Go back to the other room (where you got the Ribbon), and open the
purple chest to the northeast; there's a Javelin lying inside it.  Now,
return to the room that you exited from the south (the one with the
formerly blocked passage), and go north along the passage until you
reach another exit.  This leads to the upper path above the chest with
the Javelin--keep following it and you'll find yourself outside.

Build up your temperature, then climb up the wall.  After going a short
distance, you're given a choice (up, down, or right).  Pick the top
option (up), and head up until you reach a ledge.  Keep climbing upward,
and you'll be prompted with another choice (right or down).  Pick the
top option and head right to arrive at another ledge.  Then climb up
until you raech the next ledge; it has a path going left and an
unmarked path that goes to the right (i.e. there's no flag by it).  The
right path is a dead end, so take the left path and keep climbing up
along the wall (you'll find another ledge on the way) until you reach a
second cave entrace.

This large cavern is pocked with holes.  There's an exit and a treasure
chest, but they are too high to reach, at the moment.  Don't miss the
Save Point between the chest and the exit.  Nab the other chest in the
lower right corner of the room (there's an Elixir inside of it), then go
north from the chest to find a passage that leads outside.   Once you're
out in the open again, head north, then go around the bend and head
south and east.

In the next room, examine the area immediately to the right to find a
chest with an Ardent Flame Bracelet inside.  There are four huge icicles
here that you need to knock into the holes in the lower cavern.  This is
done by 'fighting' them.  Each icicle is guarded by several yellow bats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS:  TSURARA  <Icicle>                     LEVEL: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 300
                                  (weak agains Flame, Earth, and Gravity)
       IBIRUHEDDO  <Ibil Head?>                LEVEL: 28  HP: 740  MP: 45

The icicle (Tsurara) can counter with 'Tsurara Otoshi' (Icicle Drop).
It will do this to any person who attacks it, tries to steal from it, or
the like.  You don't have to kill the bats in order to win the battle
(all you have to do is 'kill' the icicle), but since they can Silence
your characters and recover HP when they attack you, you may want to get
them out of the way before attacking the icicle.  Killing the icicle is
worth 500 exp, 0 AP, and 0 gil, so if you want some AP and gil, you may
want to kill the Ibiruheddos (which, incidentally, you can Metamorphosis
into Holy Torches.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each time you win a battle, you'll be given an option.  If you pick the
bottom choice, you'll drop down to the room below, while picking the top
choice lets you stay where you are (so you can continue to 'fight' the
other icicles.  After knocking down the last icicle, choose to stay
where you are so that you can get the chest on the far left (it has a
Last Elixir inside).  Then, go back along the path.  Just before you
reach the door, an option appears; pick the bottom choice to jump down
to the room below.

When the icicles drop down here, the floor of the cavern is 'raised'.
After knocking down 3 of them, you can reach the exit, knock down all
4 and you can get the chest on the ledge in the upper left corner of
the room (which contains a Speed Up).  When you're ready, go through
the now-avilable exit by hopping across the stones.  This leads to the
left side of the outer path.  Be sure to examine the chest that's here
to get an Enhance Sword, then follow the path as it curves back on
itself and leads to the lower passage in the icicle room.

Keep following the path, and you'll find yourself on the side of the
mountain yet again.  Grab the rock face and climb to the right.
After a while, three options will appear (up, left, or right).  Pick
the bottom choice and keep holding right to make Cloud ascend the
side of the mountain.  When you reach the next ledge, raise your
temperature and take the path that leads to the left.  As you're
climbing, another set of options will appear (up, down, or right).
Choose the top option and keep climbing up.  Once you've made it
beyond the second ledge, you'll find a final cave entrance.

This area has a hard-to-miss Save Point in it, and if you examine the
nearby pool of light, your HP and MP will be completely restored, and
all dead characters will be revived.  Now is a perfect time to stock
up on goodies--you can use the pool to stay healthy while fighting the
enemies for exp, AP, and gil, and you can learn Smelly Breath from the
Molbols just outside (be sure to wear a Ribbon!)  Plus, you can win
Dragon Bracelets from the Blue Dragons in this cave, which will halve
damage taken from Flame, Cold, or Thunder attacks, and win Molbol
Tentacles from defeated Molbols.  There's a boss encounter coming your
way, so make sure you're ready to do battle, then exit the chamber by
going to the far right.

In the adjoining hallway, you'll see one of those shrouded creatures
(similar to the ones in Nivelheim be thrown to the floor.  Before you
have a chance to examine it, you'll be attacked by a two-headed boss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: TSUINHEDDO  <TwinHead: Right Neck>  LV: 43  HP: 18000  MP: 350
           TSUINHEDDO  <TwinHead: Left Neck>   LV: 43  HP: 18000  MP: 350

In case you're confused, the 'right head' is the scaly one, and the 'left
head' is the one with horns.  Anyway, you should have the Aurora, Dragon,
and Ardent Flame bracelets equipped on your members to reduce damage from
the scaly head's flame breath and the horned head's ice breath.  Use
Mabarrier to up your defense, then Haste yourselves.  Try using Earth and
Meteorite spells, as well and summonings, like Alexander, Leviathan, and
Bahamut to soften the boss up.  However, don't use Poison (which does no
damage) or the Kujata summon spell (which will heal both heads).  Ice
works well on the scaly head, and Flame works well on the horned head,
but don't confuse the two since you will heal a head instead of hurt it.
You may also want to use Tsuika Kouka and attack a Flame or Cold materia
in order to attack with that sort of element (but don't attack the
other head, for the same reason).  In addition to breath attacks, the
boss can also use a dual cold/flame breath attack, it can cast Quega,
and has an explosion type attack that will inflict around 1400 damage
to all members.  It will use this attack when each head is killed (so
you will have to deal with it twice during the battle, once when you
kill one head, and then again when you kill the other).  I highly
advise that you concentrate on one head at first instead of trying to
kill them both at the same time because this attack _will_ kill your
pary if it happens in succession (which means you lose).  When it's
defeated, you'll get a Fang of Dragon Pair from the boss.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you were badly beaten during the fight, you can always return to the
room with the pool to heal yourselves.  Otherwise, continue down the
passage; it leads outside (Cloud sure moves slow out here, doesn't he?)
Then climb the icy wall up to the top, where an automatic sequence will
play.  After it finishes, head along the side of the inner crater.  In
the next area, Tifa will talk with you if she's in your party; if she
isn't, she'll promptly appear and insist on coming with you, which
means you'll have to kick a member out of your current group.  Head
to the left.

In the next area, climb down to the lower path and look for a red materia
(Bahamut Reborn) near the bottom edge of the screen.  You can't do
anything about the shrouded guy leaping off-screen, so ignore him.  After
getting the materia, you can hop up to a small island of rock where there
is a Save Point.  When you're done there, jump up again to return to the
top path, and walk to the left.  You'll see a short intermission with
the three heads of Shin-Ra and several scientists heading towards the
Crater in the Highwind, the airship you saw back in Junon Town.

Once the intermission is over, walk left and you'll reach the first of
three 'shield' screens.  Talk to the two shrouded men, and they'll
each leave behind an item when they die (an Ether and a Hi Potion).
To get past the flickering shield that's in front of you, stand as close
to it as you can, then wait until the green aura is almost gone.  Now,
quickly run through it or you'll be knocked back when the shield's aura
grows stronger.  If you mess up, you'll be repelled by the shield and
will be attacked by a monster:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS:  UINDOUINGU  <Wind Wing>                  LV: 36  HP: 1900  MP: 350

For starters, you can steal a Hi Potion from the Wind Wing, and you can
transform it into a Phoenix Tail.  Even better, you can control it using
a Manipulate materia and make it attack itself!  In other words, this is
an easy battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to touch the shield from the other side, you'll get
knocked back to the beginning, so be careful.

In the next screen, more of those shrouded creatures are running around
and dying.  Ignore them, but don't miss the chest near the first left
turn of the path; there's a Kaiser Knuckle inside it.  Follow the path
until you reach the next screen.  The second shield is here, but unlike
the first one, there's a surge of energy travelling along the shield
that will knock you back even if the shield's aura is almost gone.  So,
wait until the energy surge has passed _and_ the aura is nearly
invisible, then dash across.  If either defense knocks you back, you'll
have to fight a second Wind Wing (see the above strategy).

Beyond the shield, Sephiroth awaits.  He'll cut down two more of those
black creatures before turning invisible and toying around with Cloud.
After he attacks the party, he'll summon a second version of Jenova to
kill Cloud and his friends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*DEATH  <Jenova*Death>         LV: 55  HP: 25000  MP:800

Jenova will try to Silence your members from time to time, and uses a
Red Light attack often (usually after being attacked with magic).  It
causes little damage, but too many of these will really mess up your
party.  Jenova's last form of attack is a spurt of fire bubbles (even
weaker than the Red Light attack).  As you can see, this battle is not
hard at all; just hack away with physical attacks, or if you think you
have enough HPs, use Meteorite and cast Bahamut, Bahamut Reborn, and
Alexander.  It's advisable that you wear the Ardent Flame Bracelet or
Dragon Bracelet, since Jenova's attacks all cause flame-based damage.
Give the Ardent Flame Bracelet to your best spellcaster, and you can
knock out Jenova and gain life back at the same time :)  You'll win
a Reflect Ring when the battle's over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the boss is killed, you'll get the Black Materia back (and it's
actually black this time :))  Once you're back in control of Cloud,
he confesses that since Sephiroth was able to manipulate him last time,
he might try it again.  Therefore, someone else should hold the Black
Materia and stay here while Cloud and the others follow after Sephiroth.
The first time I got here, only Red 13 would take the Black Materia.
This time, only Barett would.  No matter what character you get, simply
choose the top option when it is available (you won't get an option if
that character refuses to take it).  Finally, talk to Tifa.

When you're in control of Cloud again, head north.  There's a materia
here (MP Turbo, but notice that it's yellow when you pick it up!), as
well as a Save Point and a chest containing a Poison Ring.  If you go
north from here, you'll run into the third and final shield.   In
addition to having all the defenses of the previous shield (the glowing
aura and the moving energy surge), bolts of lightning will strike the
ground repeatedly.  Since the lightning strikes in short bursts with
long pauses in between, wait for the shield's aura to fade, the energy
surge to pass, _and_ wait for a pause in the lightning strikes before
attempting to pass through the shield.  If you're hit by any one of
those defenses, you'll have to fight a Wind Wing again (refer to the
strategy section above).  Once you're past the shield, head along the
path.  It leads to an exact replicate of Nivelheim.

This next scene is sorta like a 'semi-interactive' flashback.  You get
to see Sephiroth run around in Nivelheim, but this time, there's another
guy following him (Zekkusu, the guy you heard about in Gongaga Village).
Talk to your other party member, then to Tifa.  In the next scene,
Zekkusu will look around Nivelheim (which has been reduced to smoldering
rubble), and chat with Zangan (sp?), who I think was Tifa's mentor.
(BTW, you can go to the Main Menu while Zekkusu is running around.  It's
pointless, but I thought it was sort of amusing :))  Then, your party
appears in a flaming building, and Sephiroth appears.  Instead of
attacking, he talks to the party.  When you can move, talk to Sephiroth
and he'll teleport around the room.  When you're in control of Cloud once
more, talk to Tifa twice.  Sephiroth warps around some more, then shows
Cloud a picture of him, Tifa, and Zekkusu.  After that, Cloud has another
fit, and the screen fades out.

In the next scene, Rufus, Sukaaretto, and Houjou (the scientist)
arrive at the crater.  Before them is a monster encased in ice.  It's
one of the three 'Weapons', which awakens and watches them, then starts
moving.  Following that, Sephiroth appears in the guise of Tifa and
knocks out the other characters, then tricks whoever is guarding the
Black Materia to go to the center of the crater.  Your party will
appear in the area where the Shin-Ra members are at, and the person with
the Black Materia gives it to Cloud, who then flies to the structure
where Sephiroth is at (while you can move around up here, the game takes
over your controls in a few seconds anyway).  Once Cloud's given the
Black Materia to Sephiroth, the whole crater starts to break apart and
your party (sans Cloud) escape on the Highwind along with the rest of
the Shin-Ra crew.


=========================================================================
e.  JUNON TOWN ATTACKED!
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Techniques of the Enemy materia, Chocobo Attract
                    Materia, Force Brace, Riku x syukichikou (if you
                    didn't get it the first time).  Note that none of
                    these items are actually found in Junon Town, but
                    since I talk about them in this section, they're
                    listed here.

When you come to, you'll find yourself incarcerated back in Junon Town.
Without Cloud, you'll be taking control of Barett and Tifa for most of
this section.  As Tifa, talk to Barett.  Rufus and Haidekka will show
up.  Now that you're in control of Barett, follow Tifa as the guards take
her away (don't miss the Save Point), and prepare to execute her.  Once
Junon Town is attacked by the freed Weapon, one of the Shin-Ra officials
knocks out Sukaaretto.  It's turns out to be none other than Cait Sith,
who helps Barett fight the two soldiers who are guarding him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS:  xxxx                                     LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100
       xxxx                                     LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100

Physical attacks will do the trick here, although you can control them
if you want.  If this battle gives you trouble, you need to gain some
levels at some point in the game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice how the guard will run away and disappear after the battle?  I
guess that glitch went unnoticed...anyway, examine the door in the lower
right corner of the screen and use the controller or the O button to make
Barett try to pull it open.  An FMV sequence follows in which the Sister
Ray is readied and Junon Town prepares to engage the approaching Weapon.
When it collides with the city, gas starts pumping into the chamber Tifa
is trapped in.  When you're in control of Barett, go and talk to Cait
Sith.  Then go out the door and when it closes, head right, then out the
door.  Outside, head down the road.  If you got Yuffie, she'll be here
masquerading as a newscaster; talk to her and continue to your left.
Once the Weapon has rose out of the water, continue to the left until
you arrive at the Airport.  Then, run to the center platform and examine
the yellow box to be lifted to the upper level.  From there, continue
towards the airship by heading right.

When you're in control of Tifa again, you have to pick up the key on
the ground so you can free yourself from the gas chamber.  Your
controls are:

S       Move right arm
X       Move feet
O       Move left arm
T       Move Tifa's head

You'll need to press the buttons in this order:  X, X, T, X+T, T+O, O.
(Or, press X, X, T, X+T, T+S, S if you want to free her other hand
instead...it makes no difference).

Pressing them has the following effect:

When you press X, Tifa will stretch out her legs.  Pressing X a second
time makes her drag the key towards her.  Then press T to sit back in
the chair.  Then press T and X at the same time (you don't need to hold
them, just press them), and she'll lift the key up with her feet and
take hold of it with her teeth at the same time.  After that, T+O
together will make her free her arm using the key.  Finally, press O
so that she can grab the key and use it to release her other arm.

Feel free to take your time doing this since waiting around won't do
anything to you (Tifa's invincible!  Mwa, ha ha!!)

Examine the back of the room by the left side of the chair to shut off
the gas, then examine the door.  After the monster provides you with
an exit, climb outside and work your way down the front of the tower
(don't worry about the guards).  When you reach the bottom, head toward
the upper left corner of the screen (the cursor will appear to help you
keep track of your location, but you can disable it if you want).  In
the next screen, make your way down to the frontmost cylinder of the
cannon, then press up to go along the front of it and end up on the
cannon barrel itself (this can be a little tricky).  Just as you reach
the edge of the cannon, Sukaaretto.  She'll start slapping you, so
press the O button to slap back (go Tifa, go)!  If you're fast enough,
you'll slap her to the floor after 5-6 good hits.  If she gets in more
slaps, you get knocked over.  Despite the outcome of the 'fight', Tifa
will still be rescued by Barett in the Highwind.

Once in the airship, head to the cockpit where you'll talk with Cid.
When he finishes, talk to Red 13 and Cid again, then chat with the man
piloting the airship.  After that, go to the room marked 'Operations'
and talk to the man there.  He will let you assemble a new group with
Tifa as the leader.  From this point onward, you can return to this room
and talk with the man to activate PHS, restore your HP and MP, or save
your game.  Now that you have a party, return to the cockpit and talk to
the man again.  Choose the top option, and you can control the Highwind!
To pilot it, use these controls:

S       When held, you can use the Pad to fly without changing the
        direction you're facing
X       Press to land
O       Move the Highwind in the direction you're facing
T       Takes you inside the Highwind
Pad     Press left/right to turn, up/down to rise or descend
Start   Reveals/enlarges/hides the map
Select  Same as Start

Notice that your other vehicles (the Gold Saucer vehicle and Cid's
airplane) are gone for good.  BTW, you enter the Highwind by pressing
O when you're close to it (like other vehicles).  To gain control of
it again, just talk to the man at the wheel and pick the top option.
At this point, you'll probably want to look around and go to various
places.  However, you can only land on _green, grassy_ ground, and
nowhere else, which limits the areas you can explore (this doesn't
include the canyon floor on the Northern Continent).  There are two
areas you can now reach with the Highwind.  The first one is a cave
with a sleeping man that's just beyond the mountain range near Midgar
City (you can go here with the Buggy, but since you no longer have it,
you'll have to use the Highwind).  Also, there's a house to the right
of Icicle Lodge, you can talk to the green Chocobo inside to get a
free Techniques of the Enemy Materia, and the purple geezer who lives
here will sell you various chocobo foods.  Finally, if you return to
the Chocobo Farm, you'll find a purple materia (Chocobo Attract) near
the edge of the now-empty Chocobo pen.  From now on, you can breed
Chocobos here (refer to the 'Secrets and Strategies' section for
details.

If you look, there's a lake near Junon now (I thought this didn't
appear until Disc 3 *sheepish grin*)  There's also a barrier
surrounding the Crater, and of course, a huge meteor is hanging in the
sky (the result of Sephiroth casting Meteo via the Black Materia).  A
lot of places now sell different items, among them Junon Town*,
Condor Fort, Costa Del Sol, and Rocket Town, for example.  There's also
some new treasure to be found in Rocket Town: there's a chest with a
Force Brace in the store that sells accessories, in the back of the
adjoining room.  And if you didn't get the Riku x syukichikou from the
old man in Disc 1, you can get it now.

 * In very last area of Junon, there's a man standing out in the middle
   of the road.  If you talk to him and choose the bottom option,
   nothing happens.  But if you choose the top option, the Shin-Ra
   helicopter lands and you're given another choice.  Pick the top option
   and you can ride it back to the first area of Junon Town!  If you
   choose the bottom option, you'll be flown back out to the World Map.

Finally, keep in mind that there are some things that Tifa can't do,
like enter the Gold Saucer or play the piano in her house in Nivelheim.
Ditto with Cid, who becomes the leader during the next section (keep
reading).


=========================================================================
f.  WHERE'S CLOUD? / NORTH COREL EXPRESS
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Cursed Ring, Elixir.

Get in the Highwind and fly to the Southern Continent.  Look around until
you spot a forest with a small village nearby.  Land in the grass, and
enter the village, Mideel.  Look around, and be sure to do some shopping;
the items here are expensive, but well worth your money.  When you're
done, go to the weapon shop and examine the door in the back of the room.
You will try to knock on it.  Go outside and climb up the stairs, then
walk along the floorboards behind the house where you can buy
accessories.   You should hear a sound.  If you press O to examine the
floor, you'll receive a message.  Return to the weapon shop and examine
the door in the back again.  When an option appears, select the top
choice.  You'll mess around with the door.  When the shopkeeper asks
what's going on, pick the bottom option, and he'll give you the Cursed
Ring accessory.  (If you want to see your character act funny, pick the
top option instead--works better with Tifa than with anyone else, IMO.
Of course, you'll have to reset and try again if you want the Cursed
Ring.)

When you try to explore the north end of the town, Tifa automatically
goes over to the cat in the middle of the screen.  While playing with
it she hears that a strange man has been brought to the hospital--inside
is none other than Cloud, who survived the blast of energy back at the
Crater.  However, he's nothing more than a vegetable now.  Tifa insists
on staying by his side.  Back at the Highwind, Cait Sith reveals that
the Shin-Ra are hunting for the four Huge Materia, which they plan to
use in order to destroy the Meteo before it crashes into the Earth.
Barett gets distressed when he learns that the Shin-Ra plan to destroy
North Corel in order to get the Huge Materia, then Cid declares himself
the new party leader!  Despite his dorky running style, Cid makes a
good front man.  Once you're able to control him, go to the Operations
room and make a new team.

Before you go anywhere else, land and return to Mideel.  You can now
check out the house in the middle of the town, where an old man sits
betting his cat.  There's a large green item on the man's bed (an
Elixir).  If you try to leave, the cat turns out to be a ferocious
dog!  When an option appears, pick the top one to admit that you took
the Elixir.  However, the man will let you keep it.  On the other hand,
if you pick the bottom option, Cid will feign innocence, until the old
man tells him that he took his Elixir.  Either way, you still get the
item.  There's nothing else to do here (at least for now, anyways), so
leave the town behind and board the Highwind (notice how Cid mentions
the Condor Fort).

At this point in the game, two of the four Huge Materia sub-quests are
available to you: you can either get the Huge Materia in North Corel,
or get the one at Condor Fort.  The choice is yours.  If you want the
one in North Corel first, keep reading.  If you'd rather pick up the
one at Condor Fort first, skip to section 4g below.  Remember, you
DON'T have to succeed at Huge Materia Quests; in fact, you can lose all
four and still proceed with the game (if you decide to do this, just
ignore any mention of Huge Materia for the remainder of the FAQ).

Ready to go?  The next thing you have to do is stop a train from smashing
into the town of North Corel.  You can pilot the Highwind to two places;
North Corel, and then work your way back through the old train tracks to
the Makoro furnace, or you can land at the nearby cave-like entrance that
leads to the furnace and take the train from there.  Either way, you'll
still have to do a bit of walking, so it's up to you (check out sections
3n and 3o if you don't remember what I'm talking about).  Anyway, once
you reach the furnace, head to the center and you'll be attacked by some
Shin-Ra guards (easy to defeat).  After you do them in, a train will
leave the furnace.  What you have to do is catch up with it before it
rams into North Corel.  The next scene finds you and your companions on
a train trying to catch up to the Shin-Ra train.

Remember the digit-damaging fun you had back at the Frozen Mountain?
Well, this time, it's worse.  You have to press Up and the T button
in a steady, yet _extremely_ fast motion to make Cid pull the levers
of the train so that you can catch up to the Shinra train.  Even worse,
there's a time limit--you have to reach the train, board it, kill the
enemies on board, and stop it all within 10 minutes.  If you practice,
you should be able to catch up to the train in about 23-30 seconds, but
remember that you'll need about 4 minutes, at best, to beat the enemies
on board, so work quickly.  You fight monsters each time you leap to
a new train car, (five battles in all) and while they're relatively
easy to win, they do take up your time.  If you have learned it by now,
Degeon can be used in the first two battles for a quick win.  If you're
low on time, don't use Summon Materia because the counter still
decreases during the casting (which usually takes some time).

Assuming you get to the locomotive with time remaining, wait for the
conversation between Cid and your other characters to stop.  You can
now do the following; press up + T to slow the train, or down + X to
speed it up.  Once Cid grabs the controls, press:

                Up + Triangle, Down + X, Down + X
                or:  Down + X, Down + X, Down + X

    (if there are more commands then these, let me know, pls)

You can't enter either command while your buddies are talking to you,
so skip through the conversations when they occur.  The train will
speed up, but will slow just as it reaches the town, if you've done it
correctly.

If you stop the train in time, you get a Key Item (the Huge Materia),
and a little boy gives you a green materia (Ultima).  The next morning,
go to the house below the inn and a lady in a hat will give you Barett's
Level 4 Limit Break Manual.  If you messed up, then the train runs
straight through North Corel.  You don't get the Huge Materia, and if you
want the Ultima materia, you'll have to buy it from the same kid for
50,000 gil.  However, you can still get the manual from the lady in the
hat and spend some free time at the inn ;P.  So, it's really in your
best interest to save the town.  If you really want to keep playing
after losing the Huge Materia, then continue on to section 3g, or if
this is your second attempted quest, go to section 3h.


=========================================================================
g.  CONDOR FORT
=========================================================================

(Remember, you can do this before or after the North Corel Huge Materia
quest; it's your choice).

Pop into the Highwind and fly back to the blue tower with the big gold
bird on it (read section 3l if you don't remember where it was).  Enter
it, and climb to the top of the tower.  Talk to the man in the room with
the locked door.  Choose the middle option, and you'll get to play a
mini-game.  For instructions/strategies, please refer to the 'Having Fun'
bit in section 7.

When you win, you can open the sealed door.  On the rooftop is a red
materia (Summon Phoenix), and if you talk to the man in white wearing
the large hat in the lower room, you get a Huge Materia.  For a condor's
baby, that bird sure looks like a Chocobo if you ask me....


=========================================================================
h.  INSIDE CLOUD'S HEAD
=========================================================================

Head back to the village on the Southern Continent where you left Tifa
and Cloud behind.  When you talk to Tifa, the screen will start to
shake.  Go outside, and you'll be attacked by a huge black dragon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: ARUTEMAUEPON  <Ultima Weapon>       (you can't see his stats.)

This boss has only two attacks, Quega, and the Ultima Beam.  He's pretty
easy to beat, so just keep summoning your best monsters and use physical
attacks to deal out damage.  After you've injured it enough, it will fly
away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next scene with Tifa and Cloud is so funny!  They're puffy and
superdeformed, and well let's just say any sense of danger or
surprise at this sudden attack is forgotten once you see their wide-
eyed faces as they escape the crumbling village.

After Tifa and Cloud take a dive, you'll find yourself playing with
Tifa, who's in a strange world filled with Cloud's memories.  First,
talk to the northmost Cloud.  You'll head into his memories of the
trip he took to that one town near the Jenova plant with Sephiroth.
When Cloud shows up, speak to him again.  When you reach the 'center'
of Cloud's mind again, speak to the Cloud on the left.  Once you're in
control of Tifa, converse with the Cloud sitting on the steps to the
right (near the 'kid' Cloud).

Then talk to the 'kid' Cloud and look in the window.  When you can
move Tifa, talk to the 'shadow' Cloud.  Once you're back in Cloud's
mind talk  to the 'real' Cloud and go back to the town area again.
Everything else unfolds by itself (you can go to the Main Menu
during the burning of Nivelheim--again!)  At the end, speak with Cloud
one last time, and you'll return to the 'real' world.


=========================================================================
i.  100 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Sealed Off materia, God Hand, Totsu x Rappa, x ryuu
                     x getsutou, Suishin x no Uroko (it's a Key Item, but
                     since you don't have to get it, I'm listing it up
                     here.)

Back at the airship, prepare a new team and take control of the Highwind.
You can buy goods that weren't available before back in Mideel, and
you'll want to get the Sealed Off materia orb at some point.  To get it,
climb up the slope on the west side of town to where the hyperactive kid
is running around (remember him?)  Talk to his White Chocobo and pick the
first option (make sure you have at least one Mimetto Vegetable on you).
When a list of six options appear, pick the fifth one from the top.  The
chocobo will then reveal the Sealed Off materia, which you can take.

Furthermore, if you went into each store in Mideel and talked to the
hyperactive kid in each one, he will now be selling all the items that
you could normally buy there!  However, if you didn't go into any of
the shops, or only talked to him in one shop or two shops, then he will
only be selling items from those stores or will be selling nothing at
all.

Also, at this point in the game, the man who lost his keys will appear
outside Midgar City, enabling you to get the Key to Midgar City, among
other things.  You might want to take some time now to breed Chocobos,
do some shopping, or maybe have some fun at the Gold Saucer (since you
can now get in with Cloud in your party).

Whenever you're ready to proceed with the game, head to Junon Town for
the third Huge Materia quest (you can't do the fourth one until later).
Head into the center of Junon, and go down the main road (you'll see a
scene with Cloud inspecting the damage that the Weapon inflicted on the
town earlier).  Keep walking until you arrive at the gray underpassage
where a commander is drilling his men.  He will order his men to run
away when he sees you.  Continue down the passage until you see a door
labeled '1' against the left wall.  Enter it, and you'll find yourself
in an elevator.  Two guards in here will attack you; dispatch them and
let the lady take you down to the bottom of the elevator shaft.

When you step out, you'll be attacked by more Shin-Ra soldiers.  Ignore
the dog and go down the slope, then through the door.  In the next room,
head down the set of stairs until you reach another door.  Past it is
yet another set of stairs, and at the bottom is a Save Point.  Go through
the door here to reach a second lift which takes you to the bottom of
the sea floor.  Head north unil you reach the underwater tunnel, and
follow it until you arrive at the Makoro plant.  Inside, examine the red
light on the far wall to pump water out of the chamber.  Step outside
and you'll find yourself in a huge undersea dock where several submarines
are sitting.  Go along the walkway--it leads to a hall with a Save Point.
Walk north from here to arrive at a room filled with guards.

If you talk to the guard who's walking around, he'll attack you.  You'll
then fight the two other guards by the opening in a second battle.  If
you don't talk to the walking guard, then all three will ambush you.
However, if you let yourself get ambushed, you won't have to fight the
second set of soldiers by the other opening.  Decide what you want to do
(fun, isn't it?) and fight the guards accordingly.  Then go through the
opening to your right to find a chamber full of machinery.  Cloud will
automatically stop in front of one of the machines as you walk past it.
When you can control him again, head to the right to see the Red Huge
Materia being loaded onto a Shin-Ra submarine.  Reno of the Turks is
here, and he'll summon a mechanical freak to take you out while he makes
a hasty retreat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: KARIIAAMAA  <Carry Armor>          LV: 45  HP: 24000  MP: 200
           MIGIUDE  <Right Arm>               LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 100
           SAUDE  <Left Arm>                  LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 200
                                              (all weak vs. lightning)

This boss is composed of three parts.  It can imprison two of your
characters in his arms, and they recieve 1/3 the amount of damage that
it receives from your attacks.  However, since it has three parts, if
you're making an attack that hits more than once, your ally gets struck
twice or even three times!  Furthermore, if the third character is
killed while the other two are imprisoned, the battle is instantly lost.
Destroying it's arms should be your top priority, but the arms rotate
and switch sides when they are hit, so adjust your attacks accordingly.
Summoning spells and enemy skills work well here.  The boss' attacks are
not so strong, but they come quickly.  The worst one is the Lapis Laser
that strikes all members for +1600 damage.  BTW, the only way to free a
character is to destroy the arm that's holding them, or have him or her
die.  This makes the Phoenix summon very useful if you just freed a
friend and want to revive and attack at the same time.  You'll get the
God Hand weapon when you kill it and both arms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Carry Armor out of the way, head to the left to find a chest
with the Totsu x Rappa inside it.  Then go back to the right and run
along the pier until you reach gray submarine.  Open the chest by the
stairs to get the x ryuu x getsutou.  To the left of that chest is a
chest holding a Key Item: the Suishin x no Uroko (Fire Extinguisher).
You'll need it later so be sure to pick it up.  Go up the stairs to
find a bunch of soldiers running around in place (ha!) who will fight
you.  Cloud will then enter the submarine and be ambushed by three
soldiers.  You may win a set of 'Shin-Ra Relaxed Form Defense Tool'
armor from the guards, but it's not that great.  Anyway, there's a Save
Point here, and when you're done using it, head through the northern
door to reach the bridge of the submarine.

Here, you'll meet two guards and their scared-as-hell commander.  You
can either choose the bottom option and let them live, or you can pick
the top option and kill them.  You can steal the 'Shin-Ra Armor Type
Defend Tool Reform' (_very_ strong armor) from the captain if you
choose to fight.  Whatever your choice, examine the captain's seat when
you're able to and you'll be given three options.  Pick the second one
to climb into the chair.  From there, pick the top option to see a
description of the sub controls, or the bottom option to start up the
sub and enter the submarine mini-game (explained below).

Your controls on the submarine are:

S       Shoot torpedoes (only when you're near an enemy craft)
X       Backward thrust
T       Forward thrust
Pad     Move left/right or descend/raise
R1      Switch between close-up or bird's eye view
R2      Switch between near, overhead, or cockpit view
Start   Pause; show control screen

The walls of the ocean floor are shown in blue, and there are diamond-
shaped mines that are invisible until you get close.  You can tell how
far they are from the floor by the red columns beneath them.  The
purpose of this 'mini-game' is to destroy the the main Shinra sub (red)
in the time allotted, although you can kill some of the ten yellow
submarines if you want to.  During the mission, the following warnings
will appear:

WARNING         When an enemy sub is approaching
ALERT           When an enemy sub is firing
MINE            You are about to run into a mine
CONFLICT        The sub cannot move because you are
                steering it against/along a rock face

You lose the game if one of two things happen; time runs out (you have
10 minutes to destroy the submarine), or if your life bar (which is
represented by the red/green bar at the bottom of the screen) is
depleted as a result of being hit by missiles, crashing into the walls
or floor once too often, or ramming another sub.  If you win, then the
submarine you're in is automatically piloted to shore.  If you mess up,
your characters will jettison themselves from the sub.  Either way,
you'll learn that a Huge Materia is being transported from the Junon
Airport.  You can go there (it's the same place where the Highwind was
docked) to see some FMV of the plane taking off, or not (it's optional).

At this point in the game, you have two options available to you.  You
can either sneak back into Junon and get yourself another submarine,
or you can go to Rocket Town and do the fourth and final Huge Materia
quest.  If you already have a submarine, then you can do some underwater
exploring or do the last Huge Materia quest (refer to section 3j for
the former and section 3k for the latter).  If you need to get a second
submarine, then keep reading.

Go back into the main part of Junon Town and work your way back to the
gray hallway, down the elevator with the woman, and to the room with the
guards, a dog, and the sloping floor.  Beat the guards and examine the
dog.  When he moves aside, follow him and examine him again.  Choose the
top option, and you'll enter the red Shinra submarine.  When the guards
show up, choose the top option to let them go, or the bottom option to
fight them.  In the cockpit room, choose the top option to save the
commander, or the bottom option to fight him and his men.  Either way,
you still get to pilot the sub.  Note that if you got the gray sub, you
can't go through here and get the red sub.

j.  UNDERWATER ADVENTURE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Red Huge Materia (listed here because you don't
                     have to get it), Ten no Ganshou, Escort Guard,
                     Irreconcilable, Continuous Slice, Last Elixir x2,
                     Elixir, Ronginusu, Outsider, Highwind Manual,
                     'Summon Hades' materia, Old x x no Key (listed
                     here because you don't have to get it just yet),
                     Kari x, Steal in Addition materia.

This section outlines a series of side-quests and optional events.  While
some have to be done at a certain point, the others are listed here only
because you now have a submarine and can explore the ocean.  You can skip
this section and go on to 3k for the final Huge Materia Quest if you'd
rather do the things in here at a later point.

The controls for either submarine (gray or red) are as follows:

X       Submerge/Ascend
O       Propel forward
        - (doesn't work in overhead view)
Pad     Move in any direction
        - (raise or lower while underwater)
L1/R1   Turn to the left or right
L2/R2   Switch from side/overhead view
        - (doesn't work while underwater)
Start   Show/enlarge/hide map
        - (cannot enlarge map while underwater)
Select  Same as Start

The submarine can cross deep water, but not shallows.  If you can't
get by an area while skimming the sea, try submerging and looking for
a passage.  If you can't get over a rock wall while submerged, try
ascending and looking for another way around.  Also, the sub can only
land at docks such as the one near Junon Town.  BTW, the mini-game at
the Gold Saucer also becomes available once you have a submarine.

If you sunk the red submarine, then get in your submarine and look at
the map.  Head to the chain of small islands southeast from the
weaponsmith's house (the guy who lived near the Gold Saucer).  Submerge
and you'll find the red submarine.  Should you touch it, Cloud will
retrieve the Red Huge Materia from the wrecked submarine.  If you
failed to sink it earlier, then it won't be here.  Note that you can
wait and pick up the Red Huge Materia in Disc 3 if you'd rather not get
it right now.

Next, return to the Junon Town dock and go west until you reach a
jutting peninsula (or go north from where the red submarine was,
assuming you sunk it).  Go around the penninsula and head south until
you reach land (you'll be in a little bay, near a dock, and you should
be able to see the Golden Saucer from where you are).  Descend and
you'll find a wrecked plane lying on the sea floor.  Touch it to board
the sunken plane.

Inside the plane, go down the ladder.  Run to the left to find a Save
Point and a treasure chest (iniside is the Ten no Ganshou sword).
Enter the northern door (the one with the Shin-Ra emblem on it) and
head east along the walkway.  There's a green chest here with an
Escort Guard in it.  Go down the incline to the lowest level of this
room and head to the upper-left corner.  Hidden by a pipe is another
green chest; inside it is Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon, the Fugutaiten
(in English, it means 'irreconcilable').  Now to all the way to the
upper-right corner and search the wall for a hard to see yellow materia
(Continuous Slice).  Finally, return to the entrance and go north and
then east across the beams.  This leads to the final chest which has a
Last Elixir inside of it.

Return to the main room and go through the door on the left wall.  In
the adjoining chamber are Reno and Ruudo of the Turks, who will talk
to you briefly before attacking your party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RENO                                LV: 42  HP: 15000  MP: 230
           RUUDO                               LV: 49  HP: 20000  MP: 280

Ruudo (the bald guy) can cast Blizara and Faira, while Reno will attack
you with his Neo Turks' Light Ray attack.  They also have the nasty
ability to confuse you, which can be a serious problem if the confused
member has a Continuous Slice or Slice Everybody materia equipped.  Once
you inflict enough damage on one of them, that person will leave.  If
you kill Reno, then Ruudo will simply stand around until you lower his
HP to zero.  Since this battle is tougher than it might seem, Haste
your characters and use your best attacking and summon spells.  If he's
learned it, Cloud's B3/1 should be used whenever possible.  You'll get
an Elixir when the battle is concluded.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Turks out of the way, go through the northern door.  A chest
sitting near the entrance contains a Last Elixir, and if you continue
along the walkway and go all the way to the right, you'll find another
chest with a Ronginusu inside.  Go down the stairs to the lower area;
near the bottom of the screen are two chests; one to the left and one
to the right.  The left one has an Outsider gun in it, and the right
one contains Cid's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (Highwind).  Before
leaving, look by the wrecked helicopter for a shimmering red sphere
(it's lying between the body of the helicopter and one of the broken,
detached parts next to it).  It's the 'Summon Hades' materia, so pick
it up and then head back to your submarine.  You don't need to return
to the wrecked plane again, although you can fight the monsters here
and transform them into various '-Up' items (you can also do this to
several of the monsters in the Mideel Area).  Considering this game's
difficulty (the lack of, that is), you shouldn't have to do this,
though.

Once you're in the submarine, look at your map.  Just south and east of
the southeastern tip of the Northern Continent are three islands in a
sort of a curving pattern.  If you can't quite tell where you are, just
go along the coast of the Northern Continent until you reach an area
surounded by shallows where there are three islands (you should be
near snowy ground with patches of grass, in addition to a large
mountain).  Submerge the submarine and look for an underwater tunnel
around here (guide the submarine into the dead-end and turn around; you
should see it as you're moving).  The short tunnel leads to a twisted,
spikey object which you will take (it's called the Old x x no Key;
Buugen Haagen asks you to find it later on when you return to the
Ancient City in section 3l).

Finally, get back in your airship and fly to Uutai on the Westernmost
Continent.  Go up into the Dachao Statue area, and head along the path
until you reach the path that heads north.  Follow it past the statue's
head until you reach another crossroads with a cave entrance nearby.
Enter the cave.  Try to walk into the first fire-pit twice and Cloud
will use the Suishin x no Uroko on the flames each time, exposing a
green chest which contains a Kari x (a shuriken for Yuffie).  Explore
the rest of the cave until you find a second fire-pit.  Press against
it to douse it with the Suishin x no Uroko.  This allows you to take
the blue materia lying on the floor (Steal in Addition).


=========================================================================
k.  CID'S ROCKET
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Nothing!

Return to Rocket Town (it's beyond the mountains near the Gold Saucer).
Go to the launch pad.  It's swarming with Shin-Ra soldiers!  Make your
way to the stairs leading up to the rocket and you'll be attacked by
two soldiers.  Deal with them and you'll be attacked by another pair
of soldiers.  At the top of the stairs, you'll fight two more soldiers
and their captain.  After killing them, Cid will show up and insist on
joining if he's not already with you.  After you've made a party, press
X to continue playing, T to go to the Main Menu, or O to change your
party's configuration (but Cloud and Cid cannot be removed from the
current party).  After you choose to continue playing, climb up the
ladder and you'll face off with two Shin-Ra soldiers and Ruudo of the
Turks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RUUDO                                LV: 42  HP: 9000  MP: 240
           xxxx                                 LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100
           xxxx                                 LV: 34  HP: 1300  MP: 100

Use physical attacks to kill the soldiers and injure Ruudo, especially
if you've got the Continuous Slice and Slice Everybody materia equipped.
Ruudo can use a jumping wave attack, but it only causes about 500 points
of damage.  He can also create a Mabarrier which he usually casts when
one or both of the soldiers are killed, and he can cast Sandara and heal
himself for about 1100 hit points.  Despite all his powers, he's still
easily beaten.  If you kill Ruudo before finishing off the guards, you'll
automatically win the battle.  You may win an S Mine once you win the
battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go inside the rocket ship--you'll have to fight another battle, but it's
easily won.  Press O to open the northern door, then go into the main
room, where Cid will talk to the workers.  After the rocket lifts off,
go to the right into the next room and climb up the ladder.  Examine the
Huge Materia in the next room and choose the top option.  Cid will chat
with Cloud and several numbered boxes will appear.  When they do, punch
in the following code, one press per message box:

First Message (1):      O
Second Message (2):     S
Third Message (3):      X
Fourth Message (4):     X

If you did it correctly, the glass tube will open and you can take the
Huge Materia.  If you mess up, you'll have 3 minutes to get the code
right, and Cid will try to clue you in to the correct code.  Should the
timer reach zero, the Huge Materia is lowered into the ground.

Whether you got the Huge Materia or not, return to the entry room and
climb down the ladder; when you get near the sparking tanks, they will
explode.  With a little help from Shiera, you'll free Cid from under a
piece of metal.  Follow Shiera into the next room (which turns out to
be an escape capsule).  After a lengthy FMV sequence, you'll find
yourself back in Highwind, and the Meteor hanging in the sky will now
be much closer than it was before.  Alternately, you can do this part
(see the tanks explode) and then go back and get/not get the Huge
Materia, or you can even do this part and then take the escape pod
without even attempting to free the Huge Materia (which means you
obviously won't get it).


=========================================================================
l.  RETURN TO THE ANCIENT CITY / MIDGAR CITY UNDER SIEGE
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ultima Weapon, Elixir x3, Last Elixir, Aegis
                     Bracelet, Starlight Horn, Maximum Ray, Power Up x2,
                     Guard Up, Magic Up, Mind Up, Double Item materia,
                     Master Fist, Pile Banker, Marvelous Cheer, Ragnarok,
                     Missing Score.

Get in the Highwind and return to Cosmo Canyon.  Make your way up to the
observatory and talk to Buugen Haagen.  Cloud will use the PHS system to
call the rest of his friends up to Buugen Haagen's home.  They'll all
talk about Sephiroth and Aerith, and then leave Cloud alone with Buugen
Haagen, who offers to keep the Huge Materia at his observatory for
safekeeping.  Touch any of the Huge Materia you have and pick the
bottom option to return to the Highwind.  Buugen Haagen will accompany
you.  Pilot the Highwind back to the Northern Continent and land in the
canyon where the Ancient City is located.  At the crossroads, take the
left path and follow it into the chamber with the blue crystal that
you couldn't do anything to earlier.  Head right along the upper path
and take the stairs up to the crystal.  Buugen Haagen will talk to
Cloud and his friends.  If you already got the Old x x no Key, Buugen
Haagen uses it to create a waterfall.  If you didn't get it yet, he'll
remain here in the Ancient City until you find it and return to him
with it.

Once the waterfall has been activated, walk towards the crystal a
second time.  Pictures of Aerith will be shown in the falling water
while Buugen talks to your party.  Now, leave the Ancient City.  As
you do, Cait Sith calls on Cloud's phone and tells him that the Sister
Ray in Junon Town has been re-installed in Midgar City, and that it's
going to be used to destroy the barrier around the crater (where
Sephiroth's at).  After seeing some more FMV, return to the Highwind.
Just as you're about to board it, another Weapon monster shows up and
starts advancing towards Midgar City.  Since you can't attack it while
in the Highwind, and you can't reach it using the submarine, wait until
it reaches dry land, then try and touch it in order to see another FMV
sequence in which the Sister Ray is used to kill the Weapon and break
the shield at the same time.

At this point in the game, if you return to the lake near Junon Town,
the Ultima Weapon will be hovering over the lake.  You can battle the
Ultima Weapon by ramming into it while aboard the Highwind.  However,
it will fly away after fighting with you for awhile.  From this point
on, it will fly around the sky and make it's way to various random
locations.  It might seem as if you could just wait around for the
Ultima Weapon to show up here and there, but the beast will fly in
circles unless you find it and ram into it repeatedly.  After 4 or 5
tries, it will then head towards a new location and sit there until you
attack again.  After escaping a few more times, it will make a final
stop at Cosmo Canyon.  You can fight it to the death here (it's a
pushover, so don't expect too much of a challenge), and when it dies,
you get Cloud's Ultimate Weapon (the Ultima Weapon).  Furthermore,
it will create a crater when it crashes into the ground, wiping out
several of the rock formations around Cosmo Canyon.  However, you can
now walk across the crater and go into the Old Forest!  Normally, you
can't reach this place unless you're using a colored Chocobo.  If you
don't want to fight the Ultima Weapon now, you still fight it during
Disc 3.

Anyway, pilot the Highwind back to the crater when you're ready.  Before
you can explore it further, Reeve (y'know, the guy who controls Cait
Sith) reveals that Hojo (one of the members of the Jenova Project) is
planning to use the Sister Ray again, even though the results could be
catastrophic considering how much energy it used up last time.  So you
have to get back into Midgar City and stop Hojo beforehand.

<KM's note -- Upon getting back in the Highwind, I talked to the pilot
near Cid in order to take control of the airship.  He said something
about the airship reaching it's "Level 14 Limit Break" and most of the
text was flashing in rainbow colors (same effect as when you have the
All 7 Fever).  Does anybody know why this happened?>

When you're ready to raid Midgar City, fly the Highwind straight towards
it, as if you were going to ram into it.  Cloud and his allies will
gather together on the airship's deck.  You can now choose the top
option to assemble a new party, or the bottom option to leap off the
ship and parachute into the city.  When you can move, follow your
friend to an alleyway where your pals are waiting.  There's also a Save
Point here.  Talk to whoever is by the wooden panel and they'll open it
to reveal a ladder leading down into the depths of Midgar City.  At the
bottom of the ladder, go along the metal passage and down the slope.
Go up the the next slope and when you reach the wall, head right to
find a chest containing an Elixir, and then run to the left to find a
chest with a Last Elixir inside of it.

Make your way back to the area with the ladder and take the stairs down
to an area with a ladder.  If you climb down the ladder, you'll reach a
long walkway; head east and then go north to arrive at another ladder.
Climb up it and you'll have access to the green chest you saw earlier;
it contains an Aegis Bracelet.  Climb back down to the long walkway and
run to the right.  The floor will give way and you'll be deposited on a
lower walkway.  Head left, jump on top of the pipe, and then ascend the
ladder.  When you arrive at another ladder, climb up it, too.

Eventually you'll arrive at a path just below the one you were walking
around on earlier.  Walk along it until you reach a chute; walk into it
and you'll be deposited in a new area.  Check out the green chest to the
left (there's a Starlight Horn inside it).  Then go to the right and open
the chest that's near the ladder (it contains an Elixir).  Climb down the
ladder and press against the right lip of the platform in order to jump
down to the chute labled '42'.  Enter the chute, and when you arrive at
the other end, head left and then go up the ladder.  At the top, you'll
find a chest to the left; there's a Maximum Ray inside it. Retrace your
steps until you're back at the other area, press left to jump off the
chute and back onto the platform, and then climb up the ladder and go
up the stairs to your left (it's right next to the chute labled '12').

At the top of the stairs is a Save Point.  To the right of it is a
crawlway.  Make you way along it and you'll arrive in an underground
tunnel system.  Climb down to the floor and head south.  While many of
the passages here split off in two directions, one direction will always
end in a blocked door, so keep going south.  As you keep going, you'll
run into your friends (remember, who you meet up with depends on who is
and isn't in your group).  After heading south for a couple of screens,
you'll find a treasure chest lying against the left wall of one of those
'split-passage' areas I mentioned earlier.  Inside it is a Power Up.  At
the next split-passage area that you come across, there is a treasure
chest in the area between the doorways.  There's a Guard Up inside it.
Keep going south, and when you reach the next split-passage area, there
will be two chests lying in the area between the doorways.  The one to
the left has a Magic Up inside it, and the one to the right contains a
Mind Up. If you go south from here, you'll arrive at a dead end.  In the
left corner of this area is a Save Point, and in the right corner there
is a yellow materia (Double Item).  If you press against the wall,
you'll discover that you can't go any further.

So, go all the way back to the first area (where the ladder was).  Try
to head to the north and guess who shows up!  It's the remaining Turks,
and they're here for a final showdown with Cloud and his friends.  I
could swear that the first time I came through here, they asked if I
wanted to fight or not...but I guess not, since nothing like that
happened this time around.  Perhaps it has something to do with
completing Yuffie's sub-quest before coming here?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: IRIINA                                  (can't see her stats.)
           RENO                                LV: 50  HP: 25000  MP: 200
           RUUDO                               LV: 51  HP: 28000  MP: 250

Iriina is healed by lightning attacks, Reno by ice attacks, and Ruudo
by fire attacks.  Ruudo has a punch attack that hits one character for
2000 points of damage, Iriina can throw a firebomb that inflicts 500 to
600 points of damage (in addition to a charm attack), and Reno uses a
spark attack which will cause 800 HPs worth of damage.  They all have
more attacks than these; but I'm listing the ones the seem to use most
often.  Alone, they aren't much, but with all three of them fighting
together, this becomes one of the toughest battles in game.  Barrier
and Haste your allies, then use spells like Ultima and Tornado to soften
the Turks up in addition to Limit Breaks.  Try to save Phoenix until you
really need it, since it will revive your members but heal Ruudo.  All
three Turks will escape once you've defeated them in battle.  You'll get
an Elixir when the battle is over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, go north.  When you reach the split passage area, go
north again.  If Cid isn't in your party, he'll show up here.  Take the
right path and at the next split passage, take the left path.  You'll
arrive at a blocked passage, but there's a ladder against the left wall
that leads to the Shin-Ra Building.  If Cait Sith is in your party,
he'll talk to you.  Otherwise, you'll see him hop out of the building.
If you didn't read Kamedouraku Flyer No. 2 the first time around, you
can check out the billboard at the back end of the first floor to read
it now.  Go up the stairs near the front and look for a door marked
'Accessories' near the other end of this floor.  In the adjoining room,
you can open two chests that a Shin-Ra employee wouldn't let you
examine eaarlier.  The one to the right contains a Master Fist and the
left one has a Pile Banker inside of it.  Before leaving, go up to the
64th floor and look for the lockers (go north from the elevators).  If
you examine the left end of the row of lockers against the wall, you'll
find the Marvelous Cheer (Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon that you couldn't
take earlier).

Return to the underground passages again.  Go south past one split-
passage room, and when you reach the second room, take the left path.
You'll go outside.  Walk towards the lefthand red beam to climb up it
and jump onto the main street.  Head north and a huge mechanical monster
will appear from behind you; it's being controlled by Haidekkaa and
Sukaaretto.  After laughing in your face, they'll attack you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: PURAUDO KURADDO  <Proud Cloud>         (can't see it's stats.)
           JAMAAAAAMAA  <Jammer Armor>         LV: 62  HP: 20000  MP: 300

This mechanical monstrosity has two parts; a head and a chest area that
you can aim your attacks at.  The boss can only cause around 500-800
points of damage, but it can kneel and fire a ray from it's back (the
Beam Cannon attack) that causes 1100 damage to all members.  Even after
disabling the Jammer Armor (it can use it's Materia Jammer attack to
disable your Materia), you'll still have to keep attacking the main part
if you want to kill it.  Spells and summonings work nicely, and you
shouldn't worry about your HP until the boss kneels and readies it's
laser attack.  You'll get the Ragnarok sword once the fight is over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the machine explodes, it starts to rain.  Head north.  There are
two chests near the entrance.  The one closest to you has an Elixir in
it, while the one that's further away contains a Misutiiru.  Use the
Save Point that's nearby if you want to, then climb up the ladders.
If he's not in your party, Vincent will be on the lower landing.  The
second landing is normally empty, but if Barett is in your party, you
will see a green chest there.  Open it to get Barett's Ultimate Weapon,
the Missing Score.  If Barett's not in you party, you won't find anything
on the landing, even if you search it thoroughly.  Once you've climbed
all the way to the top, run to the right.  Sitting at the Mako Cannon's
(Sister Ray's) controls is Hojo, who will attack your party when you
talk to him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: HOUJOU                              LV: 50  HP: 13000  MP: 250

           xxxxx HOUJOU NA  <Hojo NA>          (can't see his stats.)

Hojo can use his 'Capsule' power to summon the two 'Sample' monsters
every time you kill them.  So, concentrate on defeating Hojo instead of
the lesser monsters.  He'll then reappear as a huge monster with two
independant arms (Heretic Hojo).  Since Hojo can bring the arms back
to life, aim your attacks at the main body of the boss.  He may cast
Confuse or Silence on you, so I hope you have some Ribbons equipped.
The right arm will also inflict a lot of damage, so cast Barrier
beforehand.  In his final form, Hojo can cast Slow and employ a
multiple-hit attack (Combo), which will poison whoever is hit by it.
As long as you keep your HPs up, this battle is a cinch.  You'll receive
a Power Up once you've killed Hojo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll return to the Highwind after killing the boss.  There's a short
sequence with Tifa and Cloud afterward, then the Highwind blasts off
into the sky.  Well, that's the end of this disc!  My time...17:25 the
first time around, and 14:24 for the rewrite.


                      +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                       5. WALKTHROUGH - DISC THREE
                      +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=========================================================================
a.  MAKOU PIT
=========================================================================

ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Limited Moon, Save Crystal, Guard Up x3, Mind Up x2,
                    Magic Up x2, Elixir x2, Power Up x2, HP Absorb
                    materia, Last Elixir x4, Ei x no Kusuri x3,
                    Misutiiru, Speed Up x2, Tetra-Elemental, Almighty
                    Medicine x2, Vaccine x2, Shield materia, Imperial
                    Guard, Double Magic materia, Command Counter
                    materia, X Potion x2, Ether Turbo x2, Everything
                    Affect All materia, Luck Up

You'll start off on the deck of the Highwind.  If you'd rather explore
the World Map instead, just go back to the cockpit, talk to the engineer
next to Cid, and choose the top option.  If you haven't noticed it yet,
the Highwind is now rocket-powered.

Before descending into the crater and exploring the Makou Pit, you may
want to pick up Red 13's Ultimate Weapon.  Return to Cosmo Canyon and
climb up to the second floor of the observatory, making sure that Red 13
is in your group beforehand (you can switch characters at the Save Point
near the Tiger Lily Arms Shop if you need to).  Buugen Haagen is lying
on his couch, and he is about to pass away.  He chats with Red 13 for a
while, then dies.  Back at the bonfire, Red 13 rejoins his companions,
and now has the Limited Moon in his inventory.  Also, if you haven't
gotten either of the 'optional' characters yet (Yuffie or Vincent), then
now would be a good time to add them to your party.

When you're ready to explore the Makou Pit, land the Highwind and go
out to the deck.  You can talk to the man out here to change party
members (he'll automatically ask you every time you return to the
Highwind).  Climb down the rope ladder to reach a new area, then head
southwest.  In the next screen you'll be given an option: pick the
bottom one to turn back or the top one to descend into the pit.  After
hopping down the steps, you'll see a cavern entrance.  If you go inside
it, it merely returns you to the last area, in which you can climb up
the stone column and make your way back to the Highwind.  Otherwise,
simply follow the path as it winds it's way down into the ground.  Don't
worry should the ground crumble away since you can jump over the gaps.
The first chest you find contains a Save Crystal.  It can be used once
while in the Makou Pit to create a Save Point.  Considering that there
are no Save Points at all in this level, the Save Crystal is a handy
item to have.  The next chest you find has a Guard Up in it.

In the next area, you can climb the silver parts of the ledges by
pressing O when you are standing near them (a message appears prompting
you to do this).  Go to the right and hop down the 'steps'.  The first
chest you find has a Guard Up inside of it.  Be sure to make your way
to the next chest and not explore the edge of the ledge below the chest
you just opened or you'll jump down to the bottom and will have to
climb all the way back up again (although you'll be doing that at some
point anyway, so it's no big deal).  In the second chest is a Mind Up.
You can now either climb back up and get the rest of the chests, or
continue searching the Makou Pit and get the chests when you are coming
back out (assuming you want to make more than one journey into the Pit).
To get the chests, climb up the ledge to your left (you're at the
bottom of the screen, remember?)  Go all the way to the left and climb
up two ledges, then walk to the right to find another chest containing
a Magic Up.  Go left again, go up to the next ledge, then go to the
right and climb up again.  Walk all the way to the right, climb up the
tall ledge, then head left to find a chest holding an Elixir.  From
there, walk up to the next ledge, go to the left, and climb up the
silver part to arrive at a chest that has a Power Up in it.  If you go
to the right, you'll find an HP Absorb materia just past a large rock.
Finally, jump back down, go to the right, and climb up the ledge to
reach the top again (you can jump to the top ledge from here and exit
the Pit by going back up the spiraling passage).

If you head south from the bottom of the screen, you'll arrive at a large
chamber pocked with holes.  Walk to the right until you fall down a
level, then go left to uncover a chest (inside is a Mind Up).  Go to the
edge of this ledge, turn around, and press O to jump up to the upper
ledge (just like in the last area, you'll be prompted to jump whenever
you are near a ledge ending).  Head left until you fall down, then go to
the right and step into the hole by pressing up.  Beyond the opening is a
treasure chest containing a Last Elixir.  Go back out again and walk all
the way to the left and you will fall down to a new level (since you
can't see Cloud, move left or right until he falls).  Run to the right in
order to find a chest, which has an Ei x no Kusuri inside of it.  Walk
to the left and enter the hole.  As you walk along the adjoining path,
stop to open a treasure chest to your left which holds a Guard Up, and
go through the hole that's a little farther up to reach a chest with a
Power Up inside it.  Go back out the hole and keep climbing to reach an
opening that deposits you back at the top of the screen.  To get back
down to the bottom, run to the right until you drop down, press right
again to fall a second time, and enter the hole.  The passage beyond it
leads to another hole; press left to fall down it (if you want to get
back up, just climb the ledges to your left).  Then walk to the left
until you fall, and walk right to fall again.

Here, climb down the two stalagtites in order to reach the ground where
your friends are waiting.  Each one asks you which path they should take,
the left one (top option), or the right one (bottom option).
Furthermore, you may have certain characters join you, or you may be
asked to make a new group (and you may not have many characters to pick
from).  Unfortunately, I really have no clue as to how this part of the
game works even after playing through it numerous times.  (Yes, that
means that you should still treat this whole paragraph as a NSS :))

Take whatever path is available to you (you'll get a message if you can't
go in that direction).  Refer to the LEFT PATH or RIGHT PATH sections
depending on which one is available to you.  Note that once you reach the
PLACE OF GATHERING, you can go back and explore all the areas freely
(remember that because you may be approaching an area from a different
location, you may have to do it in a different order.  For instance, you
can tackle the LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE area from either the top or bottom,
so take note while playing (and no, I'm not going to write out the
section backwards and forwards, just figure it out yourself depending on
where you're going!)

RIGHT PATH
You'll find yourself on a column of stone.  Follow the winding path that
leads along the column.  Eventually, you'll reach a gap in the path.
Pick the top option to jump down to the area below, or the bottom option
to turn back.  When you land on the ground, look to your right for a
chest containing a Misutiiru.  To your left is a green Elixir.  Take it
and continue along the path until you reach a broad, gray area.  Here,
there is a treasure chest to the north containing a Speed Up.  If you
look to the south, wedged between several broken structures is another
chest that has a Tetra-Elemental inside it.  Go back to the main path
and head east, then north.  Here, the path splits to the north or the
west.

Take the west branch and it'll lead to a dead-end where there is a chest.
Iniside it is a Last Elixir.  Retrace your steps and keep going north;
just to your right will be a chest that also has a Last Elixir inside of
it.  If you keep going north, you'll arrive at a bridge made of curving
bones.  Work your way down it and you'll arrive at the PLACE OF GATHERING
(see below).

LEFT PATH
In this room, your teammates will each ask if you should take the upper
(top option) or lower (bottom option) route.  Pick accordingly, and refer
to the UPPER ROUTE and LOWER ROUTE sub-sections depending on what you
chose.  You may be prompted to make a new party yet again after you have
decided on the route you will take.

LEFT PATH: UPPER ROUTE
Hop down onto the branch-like structure, run to the right, and when you
can't go any further, press Up to jump to another branch.  From here, go
right to reach a chest containing a Magic Up.  Now, hop back to the
first branch and go left, then north.  When you reach the edge, Cloud
will jump onto the nearby rocks.  Walk north along the path and Cloud
will dive in the water and jump out on the other side of the screen.  If
you walk to the left, then go north, you'll arrive at a chest which has
an Almighty Medicine within it.  Head right, but take the upper branch
(go east, then north) in order to arrive at a new area.

Here, head to the far right to find a chest which contains an Ei x no
Kusuri.  Then take the upper path and run all he way to the left.  If
you go a little ways to the north, you'll see a chest; it has a Vaccine
in it.  To the right of the chest is a large rock; walk in front of it
and you'll see a path that leads up to the top of the rock, where a
green materia is lying on the ground (Shield).  Take it and walk to
the left, then press Down to descend the rock face.  Cloud will jump
into the water and pop out again near a treasure chest (Imperial Guard).
After opening the chest, keep pressing Down and Cloud will dive into the
water again and end up on the other side of the screen.  From here, run
south and then east to reach yet another unexplored area.

This area is full of green shrubbery and stone tiers.  Walk to the left
in order to work your way down the tiers, but then go to the center of
the screen and walk north until you're right beneath the shrubbery.
There is a small dot here; press O to examine it and you'll find that
it's the Double Magic materia.  From here, work your way down to the
shining light (go south, then east).  There is a patch of darkness in
the light--examine it and you'll get the Command Counter materia.  Now,
walk west and then north to find a cave entrance.  It leads to the
PLACE OF GATHERING (see below).

LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE
Hop down the stone columns and investigate the chest to your left to
find an Almighty Medicine.  Head to the right and hop up the stone
columns to arrive at a chest that has an Elixir inside of it.  Then
go back to the first treasure chest and press against the bottom of
the ledge.  You'll hop down to a column where there is a chest
containing an X Potion.  Make your way to the southeast.  In the next
screen, hop down the stone columns and then go to the left to find a
chest with an Ether Turbo in it.  Then follow the path east and north.
There's another chest here and a Vaccine is inside it.  Walk to the
west, then follow the path south and hop across the columns.  When you
reach the bottom of the screen, run to the south.

In this area, go to the right and press down to hop down to a small
ledge.  Below is a larger ledge and a green chest (X Potion).  Walk to
the left across the thin stone bridge, drop down a level, then keep
going right until you see some stone 'steps'.  Go down them; to the
left is a green chest containing a Ether Turbo.  If you walk to the
left, you'll jump down to a low ledge.  Nearby, there is a ball
floating in the air.  Hold Up in order to jump from a small ledge to a
larger ledge, and when you get near the ball, tap O repeatedly.  If you
timed it right, you'll be able to take the ball, which is actually the
Everything Affect All materia.  If you missed it, just press left to
jump back down to the lower ledge and then try again.  You can only get
the materia while jumping to the small ledge, not while jumping from
the large western ledge.

Once you've gotten the materia and are on the large ledge, walk to the
other end of it.  There's a chest here (Speed Up).  Now walk to the
south and press against the edge to jump down to a lower area.  Keep
walking south and you'll reach the PLACE OF GATHERING.

PLACE OF GATHERING
On the right side of this chamber is a chest containing a Luck Up.
Follow the path as it curves around until you reach a set of stone
steps.  Your friends will show up here.  Depending on where you told
them to go earlier, they may or may not have items to give you.  Talk
to each one of them to get an item (or not), then approach the stone
steps.  Pick the top option to go down them or the bottom option to
stay where you are.  Once you pick the top option, you can't go back,
so feel free to choose the bottom option and then leave this area from
the upper ledge (walk to the left) if you have more exploring to do.

Once you've chosen the top option, assemble a new group.  You'll leap
down the steps and arrive at the lowest levels of the Makou Pit (home
not only to Jenova and Sephiroth but also to massive slowdown).  Simply
jump from floating ledge to floating ledge, working your way towards
the bottom of the screen.  In the second screen, make your way to the
central island of rock, where the final form of Jenova will appear and
attack you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*SYNTHESIS  <Jenova Synthesis>    (can't see her stats.)
           JENOBA*SYNTHESIS B  <Jenova S. B>   LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 600
           JENOBA*SYNTHESIS C  <Jenova S. C>   LV: 61  HP: 8000   MP: 600

Start the round by using Haste and Barrier on yourselves, then use Enemy
Skills and Summon Materia to dish out damage.  The tentacle-like arms
will droop and become useless after you've attacked them long enough,
but they regenerate with some HP if you don't kill the boss quickly, so
use high-level spells (Ultima or Inseki) to take them out and injure
Jenova at the same time.  When she is about to die, a message appears
and starts counting down the rounds from 5; if you don't kill her by the
time it reaches zero, Jenova Synthesis will cast Ultima.  For the second-
to-last boss, this is an easy battle. She has very weak physical attacks
(500-800 damage), and not much else. If you want to conserve MP, you can
take out the boss using physical attacks with little injury to yourself.
If she does cast Ultima, the battle ends, but you get no EXP, GP, or AP,
so try to kill her as quickly as possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the death of Jenova Synthesis, the ground will break up and Cloud
and his friends will awaken to find themselves floating in space.
Sephiroth makes his final appearance here, floating next to the core of
the Makou Pit.  You'll get to make a new party*, then the battle with
Sephiroth will commence.

* Apparently, the number of teams you can make is determined randomly.
  The first time I played this game, I was able to make two parties,
  but since then I've been able to make just one party or three parties
  (the third had only two members, since you only have 8 characters).
  For a time, I thought this was based on the paths you took when you
  talked to your friends at various locations in the Makou Pit, but I
  guess it is simply a random occurence after all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RIBAASU SEFIROSU  <Reverse Sephiroth>   (can't see it's stats)
           RIBAASU SEFIROSU B                  LV: 61  HP: 2000   MP: 400
           RIBAASU SEFIROSU C                  LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 400
           RIBAASU SEFIROSU D                  LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400
           RIBAASU SEFIROSU E                  LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400

Use Wall and Haste on yourselves (maybe even Regen), then use your best
attacks against Sephiroth, like Coin Toss, Ultima, and summon spells.
Every time you kill a few of of it's body parts, you'll be asked if you
want to switch to another team (left option to switch, right option to
keep using the current party).  In this case (if you have more than one
team), you'll find that only one team can damage the yellow orb (part C)
of Sephiroth's body.  Once part C is sufficiently damaged, you'll get a
message stating that Cloud can now attack part C as well, so switch back
to him and attack Sephiroth.  Once part C is destroyed, kill off the
rest of the body parts.  If you only have one team, all you can do is
attack.  The number of teams you have will affect the strategy used
against this boss, so keep that in mind when attacking*.  I'm not exactly
sure about this, but: Sephiroth will gain more HP and MP in proportion
to Cloud's experience level, and using the Knights of the Round materia
will _usually_ kill Sephiroth.  If you more than one team, keep in mind
that the battle will end if even one team is killed.  And interestingly
enough, the number of times you've used a summon materia resets when you
switch to a team and back.

Sephiroth can heal himself using a technique called Reverse Energy, and
he can use it to bring defeat body parts back to life.  Among his attacks
are Graviga, an explosion attack that causes 1500+ points of damage, a
fire ray emitted from his chest that inflicts 1700+ damage, and a 'Fallen
Angel'-type attack that reduces all party members' HP to one point.

* I'm saying this because one time I was able to kill Reverse Sephiroth
  before receiving the message to attack part C.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Reverse Sephiroth has been defeated, Sephiroth shows up in a new
form.  You always fight him using the team that Cloud is a part of.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: SEEFA SEFIROSU  <Seraph Sephiroth>      (can't see his stats.)

Looks like Square couldn't bother creating a new end boss, could they?
Seraph Sephiroth can cast Slow, Flare, Break, Doom, and Dispel (Dispel
will affect all members).  Other attacks include Supernova (a 'summon'
style spell that inflicts 1100-2200 damage to all allies; it causes
confusion and silence), Pyro Holes (a laser attack causing 3700-3800
damage), and Dein (ring-shaped flares break apart the ground and cause
1200-1300 damage to all members.  His sole physical attack is a wing
slash that causes upwards of 5000 damage points.  Sephiroth can fly
around, too, preventing some characters from using certain skills or
attacks against him.

Use Wall on yourself, and then heal, revive, and fix status ailments
with the Angel's Whisper Enemy Skill.  Haste yourselves and use physical
attacks, your best summon materia, and Ultima.  You can even use Coin
Toss or Throw if you want.  Seraph Sephiroth isn't easy to kill, but
he's certainly no challenge, even if you have low levels.  There's only
one thing to watch out for: if Cloud's level is at 98-99, then Sephiroth
becomes monsterously powerful and much harder to kill.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a brief automated sequence, Cloud fights Sephiroth one last time.
I'll leave this up to you...I doubt you'll lose!  My time was 6:20 the
first time around, and 1:30 for the rewrite.


                             ++++++++++++++++
                              6. BONUS AREAS
                             ++++++++++++++++

You can only go to these areas in Disc 2 or 3.  There's some information
on these bonus areas in the 'Secrets and Strategies' section, too.

_________________________________________________________________________
OLD FOREST  (Cosmo Area)

Location:          On a cliff near Cosmo Canyon on the Western Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo.  Or, climb past
                   the crater that's left behind when you kill the
                   Ultima Weapon in Disc 3--it destroys part of the
                   cliff.
Items to get:      Highbrow ST, Spriggan Clip, Slice Everybody materia,
                   Summon Chupon materia, Apocalypse sword, Elixir.
_________________________________________________________________________

You can grab items (frogs, big frogs, wasp nests, etc.) by pressing the
O button.  When you grab a frog for the first time, you get a message
informing you that if you press the S button, the _entire_ area will
reset, returning all the items to their proper place.  However, it also
returns you to the very start of the area, no matter how many screens
you've worked your way through.  If you mess up on an area (you run
out of frogs to use for transportation), you can cheat by leaving the
area and returning (if it's possible to leave given your current
location).  But if you're really stuck, you have no choice but to reset
the whole level by pressing S.  You will keep all items and materia orbs
you've collected so far, though.  Also, when you hear a frog croaking,
look for a place where you can let go of a small frog you might be
carrying as it'll be replaced with a big frog.

In the first area, pick up three frogs and go beneath the earth bridge.
Put them near the three bags hanging from the trees.  Now, quickly take
the frogs and press the O button to make them hop into the bags; repeat
this until all three bags are full by standing on a bag and pressing O
to put a frog into the next bag.  When they're all full, hop to the
other side of the gap.  Once on the other side, go down the slope and
_carefully_ inch towards the center of the large snapping plant.  Press
O to grab the bag (which contains the Highbrow ST gun).  If you get too
close, the plant will close and you'll lose almost all your HP.  You can
make as many attempts as you want, but it's best to try and not touch
the center of the plant in the first place.  Continue to the right when
you're finished here and Cloud will automatically use the pink vine to
reach the other side.  Go past the tree and nab the item bag on the hill
(there's a Spriggan Clip inside), and head right to reach the next part
of the forest.

In the second area, pick up one frog and approach the pink vine.  Choose
the top option to leap to the ledge.  If you leave the frog on the ledge,
it'll be switched with a big frog (or you can just use your small frog).
From here, you can put the frog in the bag and leap across to the second
(already-full) bag.  You'll automatically use the pink vine to jump to
the ground.  Now, pick up a frog and climb on top of the green ledge to
your right; let it go  and it will leap into the left bag.  If you wait
long enough, you'll be sent flying to the ledge above when the frog
escapes (you have to use a big one).  Once on the ledge, take the wasp
nest.  Jump back down.  Stand near the small snapping plant and press O
to release the nest; if you're at the right distance, the nest will fly
backward and land in the plant, which will snap it up.  Take the yellow
materia (Slice Everybody).  Pick up the big frog again.  Climb to the
green ledge one more time and let the frog jump into the right bag.  Jump
atop it and wait until you are thrust onto the opposite side of the huge
snapping plant.  Run to the right to reach the next zone.

In the third area, pick up two frogs, toss them into the bags, and leap
across to the pink vine.  You'll be lifted into the treetops.  Go left,
then down the trunk to reach the big bag you saw back in the second area.
A Minerva Brace is inside.  If you go too far down the trunk, you'll jump
down to the ground, so return to the treetops after grabbing the bag.  If
for some reason you can't, just hop back down repeat the last few steps
to get across the plant, get into the next screen, and return to the
treetops.

Once you're back in the trees, climb to the upmost branch and head right,
then make your way towards the broken branch; Cloud will vault across
three of the pink vines and land on another branch.  Go south to get yet
another item bag holding a red materia (Summon Chupon).  Now, go back
across the vines, and take the lower branch that leads behind the leaves
to the ground level (look for a path leading right).  Once on the ground,
grab a frog.  There are two bags to your right; look for a high ledge
beneath them, stand on it, and toss the frog into the bag.  Then, hop
onto it and make your way over to the second bag, then to the ledge with
the wasp's nest.  Take it and drop to the ground, then approach the
snapping plant and press O to release the nest.  If you are positioned
correctly, you'll toss the nest into the plant, which will close up.

Pick up a small frog and move past the plant.  Stand on the left ledge,
and let go of the frog; it will jump into the nearby bag.  Hop across
the bag and onto the ground.  Run to the left and grab a frog.  Put it
in the hollow in the tree next to you and a big frog will jump out.
Take it and go back the way you came (put the big frog in the bag, jump
to the other side, and wait for it to land by your feet).  Grab it
again, go to the far right ledge, and release it into the bag.  Now,
stand on the bag and wait for the frog to escape.  Doing this sends you
flying across the gap to a cave entrance.

In the cave, walk to the right to find a chest with the Apocalypse sword
lying within.  Head to the north, then go east to find another chest
(there's an Elixir in it).  Finally, exit through the opening to your
left.  You're back outside!  Yup, there are no bosses to fight in this
area (which is a good thing in case you had a hard time dealing with the
snapping plants).

VINCENT'S WATERFALL

Location:          Waterfall in the center of the Western Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to go to the
                   west side of the waterfall by the lake.  Dismount
                   and touch the waterfall to enter it.  Alternately,
                   you can go there in submarine--you can dock on
                   the dark-colored western side of the shore.
Items to get:      Death Penalty, Chaos Manual (in Disc 3, see below).

Beyond the waterfall is a room made of white stone.  If Vincent isn't
in your party, then you'll get a message stating his name when you
step past the threshold of the room.  So, return with Vincent.  This
time, there's a woman there (Rukuressia), and you'll get to see a
flashback of Vincent's past.  While you don't get anything out of this
if you visit during the third disc, you can get Vincent's best weapon
and his Level 4 Limit Break Manual if you come here with him in your
party during the second disc and then visit the waterfall again in the
third disc.  Refer to the 'Ultimate Weapons' section in part two of the
FAQ for more information on this area.

WESTERNMOST CAVE  (Uutai Area)

Location:          Cave lying to the east of a mountain in the bridge-
                   covered region of the Westernmost Continent.
How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to climb over
                   the mountain.  Dismount and enter the cave.
Items to get:      Mimicry materia.
_________________________________________________________________________

There's nothing in here but a glowing yellow light.  Try to touch it,
and you'll get a yellow materia (Mimicry).  Notice how there's still
a glow after you've taken the Materia? :)

_________________________________________________________________________
WESTERN CAVE  (North Corel Area)

Location:          Cave next to a mountain lying on a square of brown
                   land.  There's a river running nearby.  It's
                   beyond the mountain footpath by the shallow part
                   of the river near the Gold Saucer, on the Western
                   Continent--there's another cave entrance by the
                   river you need to cross.
How to get there:  Use a Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo to cross the
                   river to the patch of land where the cave is.
Items to get:      HP/MP Replace materia.
_________________________________________________________________________

Inside this icy blue cave is a twinkling purple materia (HP/MP Replace).

_________________________________________________________________________
SOUTHERNMOST CAVE  (Mideel Area)
Location:          Cave lying at the end of a penninsula on the north
                   stretch of land on the Southernmost Continent.

How to get there:  If you have a Blue Chocobo, land the Highwind on the
                   patch of grass on the thin island near Mideel.  Then
                   use the shallows connecting the penninsulas to reach
                   the area where the cave is.  If you have a Black or
                   Gold Chocobo, simply land on the grassy area near the
                   cave and keep walking down the cliff and out to where
                   the cave entrance is.  If you have the Gold Chocobo,
                   you can just walk southeast from the Chocobo Farm
                   across the water to the penninsula where the cave is.
Items to get:      Random Magic Strike materia.
_________________________________________________________________________

This sandy cave is empty, save for a blue pyramid-shaped object.  If you
examine it, you'll get a blue materia (Random Magic Strike).

_________________________________________________________________________
NORTHWEST ISLAND  (Round Island)

Location:          Oval-shaped island surrounded by mountains and trees
                   that is in the northwestern part of the world.  It
                   is one of the Uncharted Isles (it doesn't show up on
                   the map).
How to get there:  Use a Gold Chocobo to fly to the island and climb
                   over the mountains.  Dismount and enter the cave
                   mouth that's at the edge of the forest.
Items to get:      Summon Knights of the Round materia.
_________________________________________________________________________

This may be another empty area, but the red pyramid lying by the tree
trunks is none other than the Knights of the Round summon materia--the
most damaging summon spell in the entire game.  Simply examine it to
pick it up.

_________________________________________________________________________
YUFFIE'S SUB-QUEST

Location:          Town of Uutai.  You can go here in Disc 1 after
                   you get the Tiny Bronco, or you can do this in Disc 2,
                   once you have the Highwind or a colored Chocobo.  You
                   CANNOT do this in Disc 3, however.
How to get there:  Go to the southern end of the Westernmost Continent
                   using the Tiny Bronco, Highwind, a Chocobo, or a
                   Chocobo + the Highwind.  You MUST have gotten Yuffie
                   (though she doesn't have to be in the current party)
                   in order to perform this sub-quest.
Items to get:      Kanzashi, Fuuma Shuriken, MP Absorb materia, Fast
                   Thunder, Elixir x2, Peace Ring, HP Absorb materia,
                   X Potion, Ether Turbo, Cold Ring, Universe Manual,
                   'Summon Leviathan' materia.
_________________________________________________________________________

After arriving at the soutern tip of the Westernmost Continent, head
north.  There is a curving path that leads up to a high plateau.  As
you go along the curve (even if you are riding a Chocobo) you will be
interrupted by Yuffie.  The screen switches to that of a plain, and
Yuffie runs up, steals your Materia*, and escapes, but not before
leaving you with two Shin-Ra guards to contend with!  The guards are
easily beaten, though.  If Yuffie was in your party when she tricked
you, you'll have to fight the guards only using two people (in which
case Barett will join the party afterwards, and if he's already in
your party, then whoever isn't being used will join.  Keep in mind that
you can rearrange the party in whatever way you'd like afterwards).

* She can take 48-50 Materia (the number varies), and will steal them
  in this order of preference: Master Materia, Summon Materia,
  Independant Materia, Command Materia, Combination Materia and then
  Magic Materia.  This means that it is possible to be left with a few
  materia after she has escaped.  Note that if you're using the Materia
  Select Game Shark code and you have disabled Materia equipped/in your
  inventory, she'll steal them and you _won't_ get them back.

At this point, your characters will refuse to board the vehicle you
used to get here (Highwind, Tiny Bronco, or Chocobo), insisting that
they find Yuffie instead.  If you were on a Chocobo when Yuffie stole
your Materia, then you'll still be on it when the sequence ends, but
you won't be able to board the Highwind, and if you get off the Chocobo,
you can't get back on.  If you use the 'Start with Gold Chocobo' code,
then you can leave the island, but I don't know what happens if you do
this sub-quest while riding a real Gold Chocobo.  In any case, you can
use the Chocobo to cheat and simply ride all the way to Uutai, Yuffie's
hometown.  If you're not on a Chocobo, you'll have to walk.

From the curving path, head north until you cross a bridge, then go west
across a second bridge.  Head southeast once you reach the other side;
this leads to a north-bound path that runs under the bridge.  Follow it
and it will lead up to another bridge.  Past the bridge, the land
becomes flat and grassy.  Keep heading north and you'll arrive at Uutai.

When you enter the town, Yuffie will see you and run away.  Head to the
upper-left corner of town.  There's a path here that leads to a large
courtyard and a pagoda.  Enter the building to your right and walk along
the hall until you arrive at a room with a man sleeping inside.  Enter
it and talk to the man.  He is Godoo, Yuffie's father.  Keep talking to
him until he stands up, at which point Yuffie will appear and then be
chased away by her father.  If you follow Yuffie, you'll find that she
has disappeared.  Before leaving this area, enter the room next to
Godoo's and examine the right wall.  There is a hidden panel here that
will open, revealing a passage.  At the end of the passage is a chest
containing the Kanzashi (a weapon for Red 13).  On your way out, go into
the room to the left of the entrance.  You can come here and spend the
night for free, but if you examine the scroll on the left wall, it will
lift up, revealing another passage.  The chest at the end of this
passage has a Fuuma Shuriken (Wind Demon Throwing Star) inside it.

Return to town and go into the eatery in the southwest corner of town.
The Turks are her!  Talk to them all (Iriina, Ruudo, and Reno).  When
you are finished, go to the Item Shop.  Normally, there is a woman
standing in front of a treasure chest (preventing you from getting at
it) but now she will have moved away.  Open the chest and you'll get
a MP Absorb materia, but Yuffie will drop down from the ceiling and
swipe it from your hands!  Leave the shop and go to the southeast
edge of town.  There's a building here near the entrace.  Go inside
and examine the folding panel to the left.  Hiding behind it is Yuffie,
who dashes away as soon as she is discovered.  Chase her outside and
go to the eatery.  If you look at the jar standing outside the eatery,
you'll see that it is moving.  Approach it and press O to make your
friends block all the exits.  Then press O three times to make your
main character hit the jar until Yuffie jumps out.  Seeing that she
can't escape, she'll lead your characters to her house.

Meanwhile, two Shin-Ra soldiers run into the eatery to meet with the
Turks.  After Iriina leaves, you'll find your characters in Yuffie's
house.  When she goes downstairs, follow her.  I was sure that I
found an item in this room once, but I guess I was mistaken...anyway,
don't miss the Kamedouraku Flyer that's on the far wall when you go
downstairs.  Talk to Yuffie.  When you can move again, examine the
levers in the back room; you can pull the right lever or the left one.
It doesn't matter which one you choose, since either one will make
a cage drop on top of your allies!  Yes, Yuffie has tricked you again.
Examine either lever a second time to free your friends, then leave
the house.

Return to the courtyard area where the pagoda is and you'll see that
you can now enter the building to your left.  Climb up the steps and
examine the bell to ring it; this will reveal a hidden door.  Beyond
the door, you'll find Yuffie, who has been taken hostage by none other
than Don Corneo, the mohawked pervert that tricked you back in the
Wall Market.  He has captured Iriina as well.  Before chasing after
him, open the chest to your right to find a Fast Thunder, and open
the chest to your left to get an Elixir.  Go up the stairs and you'll
find yourselves in the altar room back in Godoo's house.  Three Shin-Ra
soldiers appear and attack you, allowing Corneo to escape.  Kill the
guards (they're the same as the ones that attacked you back on the
curving path), then go outside.

Here, you'll run into Ruudo and Reno.  Talk to them, then return to town
and head to the northeastern corner of Uutai.  There's a path here that
leads up into the mountains, where huge Dachao statues have been carved
into the rock.  Talk to the Turks again as you follow the path, and keep
going along the path until it splits.  Take the path that goes north.
It leads past a huge head to a crossroads.  Ruudo is standing here,
blocking the entrace to a cave.  If you talk to him, he'll enter the
cave.  Go inside and open the chest in here to get a weapon for Cid.
You can't get across the fire-pits yet unless you've gotten the Suishin
x no Uroko from the submarine docks (see section 4i for more information
on the Suishin x no Uroko, and section 4j to find out what treasure you
can get from the fire-pits).  There's a chest here that has a weapon for
Cid in it, but I got it back in Disc 1 so I forgot (I think it's the
Glow Lance or the Mop). ^_^;  Talk to Ruudo again and then exit the cave
and head south to find Corneo, who's tied Iriina and Yuffie to the face
of a Dachao statue.  When you confront him, he summons a boss to attack
you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: RAPUSU                               LV: 39  HP: 6000  MP: 300

This winged beast isn't that tough, but unless you were able to hold onto
some Materia, all you can do is attack.  Use Phoenix Tails and Hi Potions
or other restorative items to heal your party, and you may want to use
'attack' items like the Harmfulness Material or Fast Thunder in order to
inflict damage along with your normal attacks.  Because of their high
attack power, Red 13 and Vincent make the best allies to have in this
fight.  If you think you can make it without Vincent assiting you, then
use his breaks to inflict lots of damage on the boss.  You'll recieve a
Peace Ring when the battle is finished.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, Don Corneo will ask you a question and you have three
answers to choose from.  Pick any one you like.  Corneo threatens to
kill Yuffie and Iriina, but then Reno and Ruudo show up and send Corneo
to his well-deserved demise.  Back at her house, Yuffie will give all
the materia she stole back to your characters (including the MP Absorb
materia).

You'll find yourself back in the World Map again, but I wouldn't leave
just yet if I were you.  Return to Uutai and enter the building near
Yuffie's house.  It's full of cats.  Normally, there's nothing you can
do here, but now you can climb up the steps in the back to find a
secret passage.  Walk north (towards the screen), to find a cat and a
chest.  Inside the chest is a HP Absorb materia.  Take it and go back
outside.

Now, head back to the courtyard.  Enter the pagoda and talk to the man
there, Goorikii.  He'll inform you that if she wishes, Yuffie can
fight by herself against the five guardians of the Pagoda of Five Strong.
Choose the top option to accept and the bottom option to decline.  After
each battle, go up the stairs and talk to the person there, picking the
top option to fight them and the bottom option to not fight them.  You
don't have to kill all the guardians in one go, and if Yuffie is killed
in battle, the game won't end, although she'll have zero HP and will
need to be revived before she can fight again.  Your enemies are:

First Floor: Goorikii, a winged creature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: GOORIKII                             LV: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 150
                                                (weak vs. Wind)

Use Haste on yourself, then use the Certain Kill materia repeatedly in
order to inflict lots of damage.  Don't forget to heal yourself when
your life gets low.  The boss can use Barrier, but he's still easy to
defeat.  Yuffie gets an X Potion once she's won the battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Floor: Sheiku, a penguin-like monster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: SHEIKU                               LV: 32  HP: 4000  MP: 180

Use the same strategy that you used against Goorikii.  You might try
the Barrier spell to reduce physical damage.  His 'Furious Bomber' attack
causes a lot of damage, but it will fill up your Limit Break bar very
quickly.  Yuffie will recieve an Ether Turbo when the fight ends.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third Floor: Chehofu, a four-armed foe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: CHEHOFU                              LV: 34  HP: 5000  MP: 210

Keep your HPs up in case you get paralyzed.  Once again, using Haste,
Barrier, and then attacking with the Hissatsu materia should do the trick
if your attack power is low.  Yuffie's prize for winning this battle is
a Cold Ring.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fourth Floor: Sutanifu, a creature swinging and iron ball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: SUTANIFU                             LV: 36  HP: 6000  MP: 240

Fight him the same way you fought Sheiku.  Without a doubt, the easiest
boss of the Pagoda of Five Strong.  If you win, Yuffie will get an
Elixir from him.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fifth Floor: Godoo, a three-headed monster.  Note that he will
             automatically attack you win you talk to him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS TIPS: GODOO                              LV: 41  HP: 10000  MP: 1000

Godoo's attack style changes depending on which head is facing you.  He
has many attacks, including the Tryne Enemy Skill and the ability to
drain your HP.  He will also use his supply of MP to heal himself for
around 1200+ points per use.  To beat him, deplete him MP supply by using
the Ghost Hand item or Magic Hammer Enemy Skill (you can learn it from
the Ashigirisous that live north of Uutai; they look like bunches of
grass).  The other way to beat him is simply Berserk yourself, assuming
you have enough HP and your attacks do over 1200 points of damage.  Your
only other tactic is to stay alive until he runs out of HP and then
attack him.  You'll get Yuffie's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (Universe)
once Godoo is defeated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Yuffie defeats Godoo, he'll give you the 'Summon Leviathan' materia.

TERMINOLOGY
=========================================================================

Certain notations and abbreviations are used in this FAQ.  This is what
they mean:

S       Square Button           L1      Front Left Shift
X       X Button                L2      Back Left Shift
O       Circle button           R1      Front Right Shift
T       Triangle button         R2      Back Right Shift
START   Start Button            SELECT  Select Button

B#/# - Indicates the Break Level and which one to use (i.e.  Red 13's
B2/2 would be the Stardust Ray, while Barett's 3/1 would be his
Satellite Beam).

Field - Any area aside from the World Map.  Towns, caves, dungeons, power
plants, and so on are all considered 'field' areas.

World Map - The 3-d overhead world in which you can travel to towns and
other locations, and activate the map.  When first starting the game, you
will not reach the 'World Map' area until a good part of the first disc
has been completed.  This is also referred to as the 'outer world' or
'overworld' throughout this FAQ.

A note on Materia:  Since I was able to get many of the correct names
for new revisions, I've replaced the names of materia, spells, etc.
with their proper names.  However, in most cases I won't list the spell
in particular but the Materia you should use (i.e. Honoo <materia>
instead of Faiga <spell>).  This means that you should use the highest
level that you have (or the one that suits you the best.

And as usual, 'x' denotes Kanji I could not translate into English.


=========================================================================
STARTING / SAVING THE GAME
=========================================================================

After inserting the disc you're currently on, watch the intro or bypass
it by pressing START.  Then, choose NEW GAME to start from the beginning
(you'll need to have Disc One entered), or choose the bottom option to
continue a saved game.  If you choose to continue, select SLOT 1 or
SLOT 2 (depending on which slot your memory card is in).  Then, select
the saved file you wish to continue.

To save your game, you must be in the World Map or standing on a Save
Point while in an Area Map (these are glowing blue circles with a
rotating 'C' shape above them).  Go to the main menu and choose SAVE,
(the last option), then specify which memory card and which save
slot you wish to use.  If all the slots are full, you will get a
message telling you that you cannot save.  A note on Save Points;
you can also (in most cases), use the PHS system to change members
while standing on a Save Point.


=========================================================================
CONTROLLER FUNCTIONS
=========================================================================

The default settings of the PSX controller are:

CONTROL PAD -           Moves your character in eight directions.  Also
                        used to move the cursor during menu screens and
                        to highlight enemies/allies and options during
                        battle.

SELECT -                Shows location of character on-screen using a
                        cursor.  In battle, this turns on/off the
                        HELP window.  In the World Map, it has the
                        same effect as the START button.

START -                 In the World Map, it displays/removes the map.
                        During battles, it pauses the action.

SQUARE (pink) -         During battle, holding this button removes the
                        Command window, making the Barrier gauges more
                        visible.  It also switches between the Materia
                        window and Equip window on the Menu Screen
                        (providing you are in either of those windows).

X (blue) -              Cancels selections in the Shop screen.  During
                        battle, it cancels choices and during the Menu
                        screen, it cancels choices and closes the screen
                        if no choices have been made.  If not assigned
                        an ability, this button cancels choices and
                        returns you to the previous option during any
                        other screen.  When used in conjunction with the
                        control pad, your character dashes while on the
                        field.  Dashing can be combined with L1 and R1
                        to run at an angle.

TRIANGLE (green) -      In the field, it opens the Menu screen.  In the
                        Menu Screen, it de-equips whatever Materia is
                        selected if you are in the Materia window.  In
                        battle, it highlights whoever you want to fight
                        next (assuming they have a full Time bar).

CIRCLE (red) -          In the field, press it when near something to
                        examine it or to talk to a person.  This button
                        is also used to pick up items, open treasure
                        chests, and latch onto ladders and objects.
                        It will select the items you wish to buy or sell
                        at shops, and can be used to verify commands or
                        perform an action (like opening a gate, running
                        an elevator, etc.)

LEFT ONE (L/1) -        When held and used in conjunction with the
                        control pad, your character walks at a 45-degree
                        angle to his left.  When selecting items or magic
                        in the Menu Screen, it moves the view up a screen
                        with each press.  When selecting a character to
                        check that person's Materia, magic, equipment,
                        status, or Limit Break, pressing this button
                        scrolls backwards through the characters according
                        to their lineup.

                        In the World Map, this button makes your character
                        turn left while it is held down.  If you are in
                        overhead view, pressing this button returns you
                        to ground-level view.

LEFT TWO (L/2) -        While in the World Map, switches the viewpoint
                        from ground-level to overhead.

RIGHT ONE  (R/1) -      When held and used in conjunction with the
                        control pad, your character walks at a 45-degree
                        angle to his right.  When selecting items or
                        magic in the Menu Screen, it moves the view down
                        a screen with each press.  When selecting a
                        character to check that person's Materia, magic
                        equipment, status, or Limit Break, pressing this
                        button scrolls forward through the characters
                        according to their lineup.

                        In the World Map, this button makes your character
                        turn right while it is held down.  If you are in
                        overhead view, pressing this button returns you
                        to ground-level view.

RIGHT TWO (L/2) -       While in the World Map, switches the viewpoint
                        from ground-level to overhead.

Other Commands:

L1 + R1 -               During battle, makes you run away if held down
                        for a while.  Doesn't always work, and is
                        ineffective in certain fights.

L1 or R1 -              Selects between a single target or all targets
                        during battle when using magic/commands
                        (assuming you have an Affect All or Everything
                        Affect All materia working in conjunction with
                        whatever materia are equipped).  You can also
                        do this by press Left or Right on the controller.

L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 -     Resets the game.  Doesn't work during battles or
+ SELECT + START        the Condor Fort simulation battle.

Note that these are the default settings: they can be changed in the Menu
Screen.  Additional button commands (for vehicles, games, etc.) are
listed throughout the FAQ's walkthrough section.


=========================================================================
BATTLES
=========================================================================

There are two ways to enter a battle.  The most common way is to be
randomly attacked while exploring the World/Area map screen.  You will
also fight boss battles, which aren't random and occur only after a
certain event/arriving at a certain location.

When the battle starts, the camera will move inwards for a better view
(it switches constantly during battles, but you can set it to remain
stationary in the Configuration screen located in the Main Menu).
The enemies will be on the left, and your characters appear on the right
(usually).  Depending on a person's Speed, either you or the enemy
will attack first (not the whole party, just a single character).  The
object of battle is to kill all your enemies without getting killed
yourself.  A battle ends when either side has died, or if the enemy or
your party runs away.

To the left on the Battle Menu window is the word NAME.  Underneath this
appears the names of the three characters currently in your party.  Next
to that is the word BARRIER.  Beneath that is a double-gauge that informs
you how long your Barrier (vs. physical attacks), or Mabarrier (vs. magic
attacks) will last.  Note that they are only full if you have a
(ma)barrier spell in use, have an equipped accessory (Reflect Ring) or
are using some other form of physical/magical defense.

To the right of that is the word HP.  This shows the current/total amount
of HP each character possesses using both numbers and a bar.  If you have
few HPs left, the numbers turn yellow.  And if your status has been
changed (i. e. you are poisoned), the total amount of HPs is replaced by
the name of your status condition.  Depending on the amount of HPs
remaining and the type of status you have, your character may fall to
one knee or crouch on the ground to show that he is weakened.  Farther to
the right is the word MP.  Below that is the current amount of MPs each
character has, represented in both number and bar format.  If you are low
on MPs, the numbers turn yellow.  If you die, your HP and MP numbers are
shown in red.  Finally, on the far right are two bars.

The first bar is the Limit bar.  As you are attacked, this bar increases
in proportion to the damage received.  When it is full, it will flash
rapidly.  During this time, you can use your Limit Break attacks instead
of fighting (described later on), and your agility is increased.  If you
don't use your Limit Break when a battle ends, it is carried into the
next battle.  If you don't use your Limit Break for several rounds during
a battle, it empties slightly (but can be refilled).  Choosing to be
attacked by yourself or your friends, or being attacked by a confused
friend will not increase your Limit bar.

The last bar is the Time bar.  It increases in proportion to a person's
Speed rating.  When it is full, it flashes orange, and you are now
able to choose a command (this is also signified by the yellow, pyramid-
shaped icon that appears over the person's head and by their name, which
flashes between white and gray).  When it is not full, you cannot control
that character.

When a person's Time bar maxes out, the Command Window appears, covering
the Barrier gauges (they can be uncovered by holding the S button).  The
first option is Attack (one enemy or one friend).  If your Limit Bar is
full, then it is replaced with a rainbow-colored font and you cannot
Attack but can use Limit Breaks.  The next option is Magic (assuming your
character knows magic/has a Magic Materia equipped).  This allows you to
select a magic spell to use, providing you have the proper number of MPs
left.  The third option is usually blank, unless you have a Command
Materia equipped.  When such Materia are in use, this option can be many
things: Steal, Throw, etc.  The fourth option is Item, and it allows you
to use your inventory of unequipped items on yourself or against an enemy.
Note that you cannot equip or de-equip items or Materia during battle.
Depending on the number of Materia equipped, you may have more than four
options available, in which case the Command Window will expand to show
them all.  Other commands are listed in the order that your materia are
equipped.

At any time while the Command Window is showing and you haven't yet made
a selection, you can press right (then the O button) to guard.  You
can't attack while guarding (which lasts the whole round), but any
damage inflicted on you is halved.  Likewise, pressing left (then the
O button) makes you change rows.  This takes a whole round and you can
do no other action while changing.  Characters in the front row inflict
and recieve more damage, while characters in the back inflict and
receive less damage (you can also change row position in the Menu Screen;
changing position during battle isn't permanent).

There are several ways to attack or get attacked.  The situation chosen
when entering a battle is somewhat random, but your abilities and
statistics can change the outcome:

(nothing)         (Attack)  The standard you-versus-them setup.  Priority
                            is determined by Speed.

xxxx no Chansu    (Chance)  The enemies will have their backs turned and
                            you can all attack, run, or perform any other
                            command without being attacked for the first
                            round only.

BakkuAtakku  (Back Attack)  You have your backs turned to the enemy, who
                            appears on the right.  Not only are your rows
                            reversed (front to back/back to front), but
                            the enemy gets to attack first without you
                            being able to do anything about it for the
                            first round only.  Note that Materia that
                            work automatically (like Guard and Counter),
                            will still function normally.

SaidoAtakku  (Side Attack)  You appear on either side of your enemy.
                            Although you can't use the CHANGE command,
                            this method prevents the enemy from turning
                            his full attention to all characters and lets
                            you attack from the front and behind.

HasamiUchi*       (Ambush)  The enemy appears on either side.  You cannot
                            use the CHANGE command, and it is impossible
                            to direct an attack or spell towards all
                            enemies.  Your foes can make both front and
                            back attacks.  Keep in mind that it is very
                            important whether or not you are facing your
                            opponent--your attacks/limit breaks/magic
                            won't hit enemies who are behind you.

* 'Hasami' translates as 'Scissors', but I don't know about 'uchi'.  So
  while this is probably 'Scissors Attack' or something similar, I'll
  just refer to it as 'ambush' for FAQ purposes.


RUNNING
Normally, you can run away from an enemy party, but not always.  If you
can't run away, a message will tell you so and holding L1 and R1 will
have no further effect.  Unless fighting a boss (who you can never
run away from), you can almost always run from an Initial Attack (first
round only) or Side Attack formation.  You cannot run from a back attack
for the first round, and you must be facing toward your enemy in order
to run away (since you run in the opposite direction).  If ambushed,
you cannot run unless you kill all the enemies on one side of you and
are facing toward your foes (for the same reason listed above).

When you run away, the battle ends, but you gain no money, AP, or EXP.
Also, you can be attacked while running and it may take anywhere from a
second to several minutes to escape a battle, (if it is possible to do
so).  You can select and confirm commands while trying to escape (in
which case you will stop running to attack, use an item, etc.), but you
won't run away while doing such things.


OTHER SITUATIONS
While the game is paused during battle, you can do nothing but remove
the Command Window (if it is showing) by holding the S button.  While
a character is summoning a monster, you can build up your Time bar and
select commands, but not confirm them (this includes running).  During
enemy actions and some of your own actions, the 'Time' message changes
to 'Wait' and your bars won't fill until either you or the enemy finish
doing whatever caused the 'Wait' status in the first place.


END OF THE BATTLE
If you lose a battle (the enemy is able to reduce your party's HP to zero
via attacking, magic, etc.), the game ends.  You must start over from
your previously saved game.   If you win the battle (by reducing all
enemies' HP to zero via attacking, magic, etc.), then a screen appears
showing you how many EXP and AP points you've gained*.  Pressing O calls
up another screen where the amount of Gil (currency) you've won is shown,
and you have the option of taking items from your fallen foes (if they
had any items).  Once the battle is over, you are returned to the field/
area you were at prior to the battle.

If a character is dead when the battle ends, he or she will gain no
EXP or AP.  The same applies to _fully_ petrified characters.

    but is still lost forever.  Also, all flying enemies are immune to
    this status ailment.

Your status condition is usually always shown at the bottom of the
screen, over the 'MAX HP' section in red letters.  If you have more than
one change (i.e.  you are poisoned and slowed), then the condition
message will constantly change back and forth.


=========================================================================
WORLD MAP AND THE AREA MAP
=========================================================================

While in the World Map, you can show, enlarge, or hide the Map by
pressing Start or Select repeatedly.  When you get them, the river-
crossing Buggy and Cid's Airplane are represented as green and blue dots,
while the submarine is shown as a red dot and the airship 'Highwind' is a
white dot.  Here in the 3-d 'overworld', you can travel through forests,
plains, and fields in search of towns, caves, and other places.  As in
previous Final Fantasy games, mountains, rivers, and oceans are
impassable while walking, but may be traversed using other means, such
as vehicles or special breeds of Chocobos.  When you enter a 'location'
(i.e. a town or dungeon), you enter the area map and leave behind the
World Map.  No matter where you are on the World Map, you always run the
risk of fighting monsters.

Area maps are a series of rendered backgrounds linked together to make up
a location.  Your freedom of movement is somewhat limited in these areas.
Most FMV sequences take place while in an area map.  Aside from talking
to people and fighting battles (depending on where you are), you can also
find treasure chests, navigate through hidden passages, climb up ropes,
activate switches and levers, or save your game at Save Points.  With few
exceptions, area maps are the only place where you'll find bosses.


=========================================================================
VISITING TOWNS AND SHOPS
=========================================================================

In towns, be sure to talk to the townspeople and investigate the
buildings to get clues, items, etc.  There are, of course, shops in most
of the towns, too.  Shops sell anything from potions and weapons to
bracelets and Materia orbs.  In a shop, you're given three choices
initially.   The rightmost one is BUY*.  Choose the item you want to buy,
then press left, right, up or down to confirm how many of that item you
want.  The middle option is SELL.  Choosing the left choice lets you sell
items and weapons, while the right lets you sell your Materia.  The third
option is QUIT, and returns you to the game.

* These are not the exact English equivalents of the Japanese used.

HAVING FUN
=========================================================================

GOLD SAUCER'S BATTLE SQUARE
To play this game, go to the Battle Square and enter the main building.
Talk to the lady by the righthand booth and she'll give you an option.
Choose the top one to enter the Battle Arena, or the bottom one to
decline.  It costs 10 GP to enter the Battle Arena each time.  Should
you accept, you have to choose which character will fight by himself
in the Arena.

Once inside the Arena, you have to fight 8 consecutive battles against
randomly-picked sets of monsters.  Fighting is done normally, and you
can use anything you have equipped (weapons, spell materia, command
materia, items, etc.) to attack your enemies with.  Each time you finish
a battle, you get the message 'GREAT!' and you're then told how many BP
(Battle Points) you've won in that particular battle (it's on the right
side of the window).  You have two options; pick the left one to keep
fighting or the right one to give up and leave the Arena.

If you choose to keep fighting, a slot machine appears prior to your next
bout and you have to press O to stop the wheel.  Whatever you land on
will have a significant effect upon you as soon as the next battle
starts.  However, most of these conditions can be remedied by using
items, and some (such as Minimum) won't even affect you if you're wearing
an accessory that protects you from that type of status ailment.  Below
is a list of many of the various results you may land on*:

           Poison        -    'Poisoned' status.
           Frog          -    'Toad' status.
           Mini-Cloud    -    'Minimum' status.
           Red Orb       -    Disables Red (Summon) Materia.
           Yellow Orb    -    Disables Yellow (Command) Materia.
           Green Orb     -    Disables Green (Magic) Materia.
           Purple Orb    -    Disables Purple (Independent) Materia.
           Blue Orb      -    Disables Blue (Combination) Materia.
           Five Orbs     -    Disables all Materia.
           Ring          -    Disables accessories.
           Bag           -    Disables items.
           Lucky 7       -    Luck is cut in half.
           Boots         -    Speed is cut in half.
           HP & MP       -    Max HP and MP is halved.
           MP Sign       -    Max MP is halved.
           MP Zero       -    Max MP is reduced to 0.
           Sword         -    Attack power is lowered.
           Bracelet      -    Your defense is lowered.
           Stopwatch     -    Time bar takes x30 longer to max out.
           Lv. Down      -    This lowers your level by 5, 10, 15....
           Cure          -    Gain back 9999 HP.

*  Of course, it is possible to cheat.  For example, if your Magic
   materia have been disabled but you just used Monomane after casting
   a magic spell, you can mimic yourself to still use that spell.  Or
   if you have Nageru combined to a Command Counter materia and your
   items are disabled, you will still hurl one of your throwable items.

Each time you choose to keep fighting, yet another bar appears on the
slot machine.  And because the eight battles are continuous, you'll keep
whatever ailment you landed on in the last battle (unless you cured it),
and get another ailment as well, making the battles progressively harder
as you suffer from more and more handicaps.

You do not gain AP, EXP, or gil for fighting in the Battle Arena.  You
can't learn enemy skills, either, even if you proceed to win all eight
battles.  You can steal or henka enemies to get items, but that's it.
Using Limit Breaks in the Arena won't deplete your Limit bar when the
battles are over, though.  Your fighting spree ends if:

 - You win all 8 battles.
 - You choose to give up after completing a battle.
 - You cast Escape on yourself or use an item that has a similar effect.
 - You run away :)
 - You are killed during the course of the battles :(

Unless you're killed or run away, you will keep all the Battle Points
that you've earned from each fight.  What's more, you can continuously
enter the Battle Arena (providing that you have enough GP) and fight
over and over to pick up even more Battle Points.  However, you lose
_all_ your BP if you leave the Battle Square, so you have to get the
number of points you want in one trip.  You can trade in the Points
you've earned for prizes by going to the machines on the left or right
side of the entrance and examining them.  The following chart appears if
you have enough BP to purchase something:

You can buy as many of each item as you like if you have enough BP.


BATTLE SQUARE: THE URA BATTLE
In order to gain access to the URA (reverse) Battle, you have to be in
Disc 2 or 3.  Cloud must be in your party, and you have to have the
Ultima Weapon as well.  Go to the Battle Square and keep fighting
until you have enough BP to buy Cloud's Limit Break Manual or the Double
Summon materia (you don't have to use Cloud to earn the Battle Points).
Purchase one of them, then fight some more until you can afford the
other item.  Make sure that Cloud has learned all his limit breaks
except for his Level 4 Limit Break, then use his Manual on him and
equip him with the Ultima Weapon and the Double Summon materia (you
don't need to attach a Summon Materia to it).  Talk to the lady at the
desk and she'll invite you to participate in the URA Battle.  You'll
have to win eight consecutive fights against 8 boss monsters, even ones
that you may not have met yet, like PuraudoKuraddo and JamaaAamaa.  If
you're able to defeat all the bosses, then Dio will reward Cloud with
the Final Attack materia.


ALL THE GOLD YOU'D EVER WANT...SORT OF
While I have yet to meet him, several people have told me that a man
will show up outside of the Gold Saucer from time to time.  He'll be
standing near the back of the screen in the outer entrace area (where
the Save Point is).  If you talk to him, he will trade you 1 GP for
100 gil.  You can purchase up to 100 GP off him every time he appears.


A MYSTERIOUS OPPONENT
If you get a high enough time score in the Snowboarding game at the
Gold Saucer (which, BTW, has different courses than the one at Icicle
Lodge), you'll get to race against a 'ghost' racer.  Who could this
master of the snowy slopes be?  A Moogle, that's what.  Don't make
Cloud look bad in front of all his friends--beat the Moogle!


CONDOR FORT:  THE MINI-BATTLE GAME
While you can play this game at an early point in your quest, (at least,
I could swear that I played it in Disc 1 once) you'll have to play and
win if you want the game to progress once you reach Disc Two.  What's
written here are brief instructions and a simple strategy for winning;
the game relies heavily on instructions which I (of course) can't
understand.  The object of the game is to prevent the enemy from taking
your land (this is indicated by a pink bar to the left of the screen),
and to wipe your foes out before they finish you off.  Your guys are
blue; the enemy's force is red.

In the beginning, you'll be in control of a cursor and there are no
enemies on the screen.  You can use this time to place your allies
before the battle begins (while you can place icons during the battle,
it's easier to start off right now).  You can only set people as far
as the red line; if you can't place a person, a red X appears over the
hand cursor.  Placing icons costs money (gil).  Remember, you can't
place bad guys!  The types and statistics of each icon (good and bad)
are as follows:

STATS. OF THE GOOD GUYS  ________________________________________________

NAME                    HP      ATTACK  RANGE   COST    STRONG/WEAK VS

Commander               250             ???

*   These guys can fly over obstacles, giving them more range.

The bad part about all this is that it cost real money (your money!) to
play this game.  So it's best that you stock up on gil before playing
this game.  To buy an icon, use the controller to select them and press
O.  Then choose where you want to place one and press O again.  If
you're placing a (Fire) Catapult or (Triple) Boulder, then you'll see a
red circle or wedge-shape when you place them; this indicates their line
of fire.  Use the Control Pad to choose how you want them to aim their
attack.

When you're ready, press X and choose the top option.  The battle
begins!  Your controls work like this:

O               Accept a command.  Place the cursor over a character
                and place this button and you'll be given an option;
                see the list of icons to see what options are available.
X               Decline a command
L1 / L2         Decrease the speed of the battle
R1 / R2         Increase the speed of the battle
Start           Pause/unpause the game
Select          Show/hide instruction screen (big help, that one....)
Pad             Moves cursor/put over ally or foe to see their
                statistics and the direction they're heading in.

Every time one of your icons finishes walking, enters battle, or is
killed, you will be asked if you want to go to their location/give them
a new command (if they died, it asks if you want to place a new one).
Press O to accept, or X to decline.


ICON OPTIONS  ___________________________________________________________

(Please note that the option names are made up and not the exact Japanese
equivalent).

(Boulder)               TOP OPTION - RANGE CHANGE.  You can redirect
(Triple Boulder)        either type of droppers' line of fire.
                        BOTTOM OPTION - DISMANTLE.  The dropper is
                        destroyed.

(Catapult)              TOP OPTION - RANGE CHANGE.  You can redirect
(Fire Catapult)         either type of catapult's line of fire.
                        BOTTOM OPTION - DISMANTLE.  The catapult is
                        destroyed.

Fighters                OPTION - WALK.  Pick where you want any of the
Defenders               three icons to move to and press O.  If they
Shooters                can't walk to a certain location, an X appears
                        over the cursor.

Repairer                OPTION - WALK.  Works just like the WALK
                        command explained above.

                        If you make a Repairer walk near a damaged
                        Catapult, Fire Catapult, Boulder, or Triple
                        Boulder, he can repair them (give them back
                        HPs).  These guys can automatically fight, too.

Worker                  TOP OPTION - WALK.  Works just like the WALK
                        command explained above.
                        BOTTOM OPTION - BOMB.  Creates a bomb that
                        explodes when enemies approach.

The 'Dismantle' command for the catapults and droppers may seem useless,
but once an enemy force has passed beyond the range of one of these
icons, they are useless.  To free up space for more icons, (you can only
have 20 at a time, remember?) you'll want to use this ability.

Basically, the battle is fairly automatic.  People attack when close,
the catapults and droppers fire continuously.  All you have to do is
move, replenish, and place new members.  The battle ends when the 'land
taken' meter maxes out (i.e. they reach the little brown hut) or you
win the battle by destroying all the enemies.  Including the boss who
shows up when most of the enemy force is defeated, there are about 40
enemies in total, who climb up the screen in a more or less steady,
continuous wave.  If you've played FF3, this feels a little like those
'mass-crazy-fight-till-you drop battles', but without the rush of
adrenaline that usually accompanies such a fight.


STRATEGY
Hope you have some money.  Start by placing Triple Boulders at the top of
each path and angle their line of fire to follow the path (that's 4).
Then, buy another one and place it at the main junction and make it fire
straight forward.  Now, purchase four Fire Catapults and place them at
the bottom of the paths, as close to the red line as you can.  Angle
their line of fire to hit where the Triple Boulders can't.  If you can
spare the gil, place two more just a little ways south and to either side
from the main Triple Boulder for added protection.  Still with me?  Place
some Defenders and Attackers down at the bottom, then place a whole bunch
of Fighters, Attackers, and Defenders at the top of the screen.  Last,
stick in some Shooters in hard-to-reach areas where they can pelt the
enemy.  As your installments are destroyed/killed, all you have to do is
place new ones.

If you have a _lot_ of cash, then just go crazy with the Triple Boulders
and keep placing new ones (since they'll instantly fire).  If the enemy
gains too much ground, start amassing forces of Defenders and Attackers
to take your opponents out and defend your installations.  The boss is
easy to kill since he's slow and shows up when there's not a lot of
people left (leaving him all buy himself).  Just gang up on him with
Defenders and Fighters, and if you've placed them earlier, try to steer
him towards the Bombs that the Workers can lay.


=========================================================================
NAME YOUR CHARACTER
=========================================================================

Every time you get a new companion (or capture a Chocobo from Disc 2
onwards), you can name it.  The 'naming' screen appears whenever you're
able to name someone/something, and it works like this:

You can use X to move back a space and O to select the letter/symbol.
L1 and R1 can be used to toggle between the three alphabets at will.
The list of options to the right are:

HIRAGANA  (Kana)    -  Brings up the hiragana-style alphabet.
KATAKANA  (Kana)    -  Brings up the katakana-style alphabet.
EISU      (English) -  Brings up the English alphabet.
SUPEESU   (Space)   -  Moves the name cursor one space forward.
SAKUZYO   (Erase)   -  Erases character in previous space.
KESUTEI             -  Confirms name and returns to the game.
DEFORUTO  (Default) -  Replaces with character's default name.

Below is a list of the three 'alphabet' charts so that you can spell
out a name in whatever style you want.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIRAGANA CHART

A    I    U    E    O    a    i    u    e    o

HA   HI   HU   HE   HO   BA   BI   BU   BE   BO
MA   MI   MU   ME   MO   PA   PI   PU   PE   PO
YA   YU   YO   ya   yu   yo   tsu       ,    .
RA   RI   RU   RE   RO   WA   WO   N    !    ?

 SI can also be SHI            TI can also be CHI
 ZI can also be JI             TU can also be TSU
 HU can also be FU             DU can also be DZU

 tsu  works in a manner opposite of the other 'lowercase' characters
      (see below for details).  The character proceeding it remains
      unchanged, but the combination is spelled either with or without
      the 'tsu' (like KUTSU).  The 'combined' characters are then
      sounded as if it were just one character.

 - NO, written in hiragana, is always used to seperate words.  It's
   English equivalent would be 'of' (for instance, Honoo NO Yubiwa
   is Ring OF Flame).

 - In hiragana, capitalizations have no meaning.  I'm ony using capital
   and lowercase letters to differentiate between the different types.
   The lowercase characters (a, i, e, u, o, ya, yu, yo), when preceded
   by a captial character, are joined together.

 - For example, JANPING is actually written JIyaNPING (at least in
   romaji).  This is because the last 'letter' in the character JI is
   replaced by the lowercase character 'ya'.

 - Although they look different, the Japanese-style period and comma
   mean the exact same thing as they do in English.

 SI can also be SHI            TI can also be CHI
 ZI can also be JI             TU can also be TSU
 HU can also be FU             DU can also be DZU
 VA can also be VI, VE, VU     .. is an ellipsis (...)

 .    is used to divide a first and last name.  It's _not_ a period
      (that's in the hiragana alphabet).

 --   means to extend the last sound (always a vowel).  So KANASHI--
      would be KANASHII since you added a -- after SHI.

 tsu  means to repeat the next sound (always a consonant).  So
      MIMEtsuTO would be MIMETTO since you added a tsu before TO.

 - In katakana, capitalizations have no meaning.  I'm ony using capital
   and lowercase letters to differentiate between the different types.
   The lowercase characters (a, i, e, u, o, ya, yu, yo), when preceded by
   a captial character, are joined together.

 - For example, RIyu is actually written RYU (at least in romanji).  This
   is because the last 'letter' in the character RI is replaced by the
   lowercase character 'yu'.

 - Also, if you want to get a WI sound (as in 'wizard') then you'd
   write out a large 'U' and a small 'i'.  This creates a 'vi' sound
   which is used for most of the 'w-' words.

 hrt   is a heart-shaped symbol
 arw   is an arrow-shaped symbol pointing right
 XIII  is the roman numeral 'XIII' (thirteen)

Well anyway, my knowledge of Japanese grammer isn't exactly the greatest,
(since I learned it from playing this game!) so any corrections would be
appreciated.  Unlike most RPGs, you can make a character's name all blank
spaces and the CPU will accept it (I wouldn't try it unless you're not
too easily confused, though).  Most of you guys will just use the English
alphabet, but since the Japanese syllables are, you know, 'doubled', you
can fit a pretty long name into only a few spaces.

        Amount of energy in the Limit Break gauge  (bottom bar)

At the bottom of the screen is listed the amount of time you've spent
playing, and beneath that, the amount of gil (currency) you're carrying.
Beneath that is the name of your location.  To the far right are ten
commands that you can select and choose:

AITEMU  (Item)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screen shows the items you have.  You can USE an item, ARRANGE your
items in eight different styles, or view your KEY ITEMS (these commands
are in order from left to right).  Depending on the item you choose, you
may be able to use it on you or your companions (choose with the pointer).

TSUKAU  (Use)          - Move the cursor to select and use an item.
SEITON  (Put in Order) - Arrange the items in one of eight ways:

  ZIBUNDE            - Do-it-yourself.
  FIIRUDO  (Field)   - Items usable while on the World Map/Field are at
                       the top of the list.
  BATORU  (Battle)   - Items usable during a battle are at the top of
                       the list.
  NAGERU  (Throw)    - Items that can be thrown (Nageru) are at the
                       top of the list.
  SHURUI  (Category) - Items are grouped by category (Weapons,
                       Bracelets, Accessories, and Items).
  NAMAE  (Name)      - Items are sorted by name (using the Japanese
                       alphabet).
  OOI                - Items that you have the most of are at the top
                       of the list.
  TSUKUNAI           - Items that you have the least of are at the
                       top of the list.

KIIAITEMU (Key Item) - Shows what Key Items you have.  You can see
                       an item's description by pressing O and moving
                       the cursor.


MAHOU  (Magic)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After choosing this command, choose the character whose magic you'd like
to view.  When the screen changes, highlight MAHOU to see what magic
your character has equipped, SHOUKAN to see what summon materia he or
she is wearing, or TEKI NO WAZA, to see what enemy skills have been
learned.  You can use the O button and the cursor to see descriptions of
the spells and use the ones that are highlighted.


MATERIA  (Materia)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After choosing this command, choose the character whose Materia you'd like
to view.  The top row shows Materia holders on your weapon, and the bottom
shows holders attached to your bracelet.  To the left of the weapon bar is
this command:

TESIKA - lets you see how your Materia will be displayed during battles.

To left of the bracelet bar are these commands (press O to reveal them):

SEITON  (Put in Order)      - arrange your materia (by color, not type).
SUBETE HAZUSU  (Remove All) - unequip all your materia.
SUTERU  (Throw Away)        - dispose of a materia.

To equip materia, place the cursor over a slot and press O.  A list of
materia will be shown.  Scroll up or down using the controller or the
L1 and L2 buttons until you find the materia you want, then press O
again.  If you do this to a slot that already has a materia in it, it
will be switched with the one you selected.  To de-equip materia, select
a slot with a materia on it, move the cursor to a blank space in the
materia list, and press O.

When the cursor is hilighting a materia, the following information is
shown:

 - A description of the materia (this appears in the long, thin box)
 - An information box showing the following stats.:

   Type of Materia / Materia name           no. of level stars
   Symbol for Damage Type (if any)          Current AP
                                            AP needed for next level

   Ability of materia                       Score Changes

   (either the spell name, like             (shows how the materia will
   Fire 1 or Cure, or a                     alter your scores when it
   description, such as Gil Up.             is equipped, such as changes
   Otherwise, just the materia's            to Luck or Maximum HP.  A
   name will be given.  If a                increase is shown in yellow;
   ability is shown in black,               decreases are in red.
   it cannot be used).

Please refer to the 'Materia Orbs' part of Section 15 of the FF7 FAQ for
more detailed information.


SOUBI  (Equipment)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After choosing this command, pick the character whose equipment you'd
like to change.  The first row changes your weapon, the second row
changes your bracelet, and the third row changes any special items you
have equipped.  If you have other items that can be equipped, they're
shown in the box to the right.  In the top-left box, the number of
Materia holders for that item is shown, and in the lower box, the
benefit/loss of equipping a certain item will be shown (yellow is better,
red is worse).  Beneath the materia box, the AP growth for that item is
shown (normal, x0, x2 or x3).


SUTAATASU  (Status)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fifth option is STATUS.  Choose the character whose status you want
to see.  Here, you see the same stats shown on the main screen, although
the EXP and Limit Break bars are also shown in number format.  On the
left are a list of stats, they are, in order:

CHIKARA            Power
SUBAYAI            Speed
TAIRYOKU           Physical Strength
MARYOKU            Magical Power
SEISHIN            Mind
UN                 Luck

BOUGEKI RYOKU      Attack Power      - Power + Physical Strength
MEICHUU RITSU      Hit Rate          - Power + Speed
BOUGYO RYOKU       Defense Power     - Physical Strength + Mind
KAIHI RITSU        Evade Rate        - Speed + Luck
MAHOU KOUGEKI      Magic Attack      - Magical Power + Mind
MAHOU BOUGYO       Magic Defense     - Magical Power + Mind
MAHOU KAIHI RITSU  Magic Evade Rate  - Magical Power + Speed

To the right is shown your character's commands in the battle screen, and
below that is shown the weapon, bracelet, and special item name and the
Materia they can hold.  Pressing O while at this screen shows another
screen where different attributes your character has are highlighted.

The first four rows are for damage types.  Although the rows go from
left to right, I'm listing it in a top to bottom format:

KANJI   ROMANJI   MEANING                      GAME TERMS
      Honoo     Inflammation, blaze          Fire Damage

      Sei       Holy, saint, master          Holy Damage

Halfway down the screen is a larger, two-row list (it's shown twice).
The list is for status changes:

Going left to right, top row....

If you check this screen and one of the symbols is lit up, that means
that that particular type of damage is being affected by the item you're
wearing (it does no damage, is halved, restores HP, etc.)  If part of
one of the lower lists is lit up, that means that that particular kind
of status ailment is being affected by the item you're wearing.  To see
what kind of 'affect' is in place, you need only look at the blue words
to the far right:

  ZOKUSEI  (Attribute)  _________________________________________
The damage type row is listed four times because there are four
attributes that can affect damage types.  They are:

    KOUGEKI  (Attack)
   - Attacks hit with highlighted attribute.

    HANGEN  (To Halve)
   - Damage from highlighted attribute is halved.

    MUKOU  (No Effect)
   - Attacks that hit with the highlighted attribute have no effect on
     you.

    KYUUSHUU  (Absorb)
   - When hit, you will absorb the highlighted attribute and gain HP
     instead of losing it.


  TSUIKA  (Additional)  ___________________________________________
The two-row list of status changes is shown twice because there are two
additional affects that affect status changes.  They are:

    KOUGEKI  (Attack)
   - An attack you make also hits with the highlighted status ailment.

    BOUGYO  (Defense)
   - In addition to damage you take during battle, you will defend
     yourself against the highlighted status ailment.

Special damage is damage that can't be defended against because it has no
element type or traits (meaning that even with an accessory, Barrier, or
Mabarrier equipped, it will still hit for full damage).  I think the only
way to protect against special damage is if you are invincible (via the
Shield spell or Aerith's Breaks) but this may not be true.


TAIKEI  (Organize)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After choosing this command, press the O button twice to switch a person
between front and back row, or choose one character, than another, to
make them switch position.  The switch is permanent until you change it.


RIMETTO  (Limit)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screen shows you the same stats as on the main screen (minus the EXP
bar).  Your max Limit level and learned Limit Breaks are highlighted
below.  To the right are two commands.

SETTO        - Choose what Limit Break level you want to use, as long
(Set)          as it's available.  Choosing a new level will empty
               your Break meter, BTW.  This is the left option.

CHEKKU       - Pick this and use the cursor to see descriptions of each
(Check)        Limit Break after picking the Break Level you want to
               view.  This is the right option.


KONFIGU  (Config.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choosing this command take you to the Configuration screen.  There, you
have the following options:

WINDOU KARAA  (Window Color)
After selecting this option, choose a corner of the small window and
adjust the amount of red, blue or green by using the control pad.  To
verify a color change, back up twice to the config. screen.  You cannot
return to the default color unless you enter it manually.


SEUNDO  (Sound)
Pick between:

 Left:   MONORARU  (Monaural) - for monaural sound output.
 Right:  SUTEREO   (Stereo)   - for stereo sound output.


KONTOROORAA  (Controller)
Pick between:

 Left:   NOOMURU   (Normal) - Use the default controller settings.
 Right:  KASATAMU  (Custom) - Customize the controller.

To customize your controller, highlight 'Custom' and press O.  Then
press Start.  Now, use the cursor to move to the function you want
to change and press the desired button to assign that function to the
pressed button.  The order of functions is:

  O       =  KISUTEI   (Accept)
  X       =  KANNSERU  (Cancel)
  T       =  MENYUU    (Menu)
  S       =  EXT       (Extra)
  L1      =  HIDARI 1  (Left One)
  R1      =  MIGI 1    (Right One)
  L2      =  HIDARI 2  (Left Two)
  R2      =  MIGI 2    (Right Two)
  Select  =  HERUPU    (Help)
  Start   =  PUUZU     (Pause)

You can set the buttons to have any command, but you can't exit out of
this screen if you try to give each button the same commands.  Press
LEFT when you are done setting the controller the way you want.

KAASORU  (Cursor)
Pick between:

Left:   SHOKI  (Initial) - The cursor will always appear at the top of
                           the Main Menu.
Right:  KIOKU  (Memory)  - The cursor will appear on the sub-menu you
                           last selected when it is opened.


ATB  (Active Time Battle)
Choose from:

Left:    AKUTIBU  (Active)      - Time is always running.
Middle:  ASUSUNU  (Recommended) - Time stops during item or magic use.
Right:   UEITO    (Wait)        - Time stops when selecting items or
                                  magic (and their respective targets).

Even with Active Battle turned on, time still pauses during the use
of a summon spell, certain enemy actions, and other various attacks.


BATORU SUPIIDO  (Battle Speed)
Press right to slow down the speed of battles, or left to increase it.


BATORU MESSEEJI  (Battle Message)
Press right to make a message during battle appear longer, or left to
make it appear for a shorter period of time.


FIIRUDO MESSEEJI  (Field Message)
Press right to make a message spell out slower, or left to make it spell
out faster.


KAMERA ANGURU  (Camera Angle)
Pick from:

Left:   OOTO   (Auto)  - The camera will move around freely and focus
                         on ally and enemy actions.
Right:  KOTEI  (Fixed) - The camera view stays in the exact position
                         as when the battle first begins.


MAHOU NO NAROBIKATA  (Magic Rank)
This option lets you set up your magic spell order (attacking, healing,
and other, I suppose), in one of six setups.  This doesn't seem to affect
your list of spells, though, so I'm not too sure of this option's purpose.

NO. 1:  Kaifuku        Kougeki        Kansetsu
NO. 2:  Kaifuku        Kansetsu       Kougeki
NO. 3:  Kougeki        Kansetsu       Kaifuku
NO. 4:  Kougeki        Kaifuku        Kansetsu
NO. 5:  Kansetsu       Kaifuku        Kougeki
NO. 6:  Kansetsu       Kougeki        Kaifuku

KAIFUKU is for healing spells, KOUGEKI is for attacking spells, and
KANSETSU is for 'indirect' spells, like Escape.


PHS (Party Hensei System)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most cases, PHS is usable while standing on a Save Point or during
any time while standing on the World Map.  You don't have this option
in the beginning, BTW.  Choose the character you which to eject from
your party and the person you want to join from the right (or vice
versa).  Keep in mind that you can't eject the leader of your party
(usually Cloud), and in some cases, certain characters insist on going
with you, so they can't be removed for the time being, either.

NOTE:  Characters who aren't in your immediate party still gain levels!
       However, they only gain a small amount of EXP in relation to your
       party, so they tend to fall 3-5 levels behind if not used for a
       long time.


SEEBU  (Save)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last option.  Pick it, then choose the Memory Card slot you want to
use, then choose one of fifteen Save slots you want to save your game in.
Choose the top option to save or the bottom option to not save.  If no
Memory Card is inserted or there's no more space, a message will tell
you so.

________________________________________________________  ABOUT THIS LIST

 - Note that the romaji was not translated directly.  In some cases,
   the actual kanji-to-romaji spellings are different from what I
   interpreted them as; I assume that both are correct.  Below are
   the direct spellings as opposed to the spellings in the above
   list:

   Reiki    = Burizado, Burizara, Burizaga
   Daichi   = Kueiku, Kueira, Kueiga
   Doku     = Baio, Baiora, Baioga
   Juuryoku = Gurabide, Gurabira, Gurabiga
   Kaifuku  = Kearu, Kearura, Kearuga
   Fulkea   = Furukea
   Altema   = Arutema

 - Pretty much all of the kanji used in the spellings of the Limit Breaks
   were translated kanji by kanji (I'm horrible at pairing them).  I know
   the names sound funky and make no sense, but I'm at a loss unless
   someone provides me with the actual translations.

 - Characters I weren't able to translate are replaced with an 'x'.
   Kanji that I couldn't display are replaced with an 'X'.

 - If an object's name is untranslated (such as 'xx no x'), then the
   effect (for items and accessories) or statistics (for weapons and
   bracelets) of that object will be given in parenthesis instead, so
   you can tell what the object is by what it does/how if affects you.
   The statistics are listed in this order:

   WEAPONS:
   (Attack Power/Hit Rate/Single Materia Holders/Connected Materia
   Holders/Gained AP Bonus)

   BRACELETS:
   (Defense Power/Evade Rate/Magic Defense Power/Magic Evade Rate/Single
   Materia Holders/Connected Materia Holders/Gained AP Bonus)

 - Words enclosed in [ ] take up two lines due to their size.

 - Finally, anything enclosed in < > is accessible/usable only with a
   Game Shark code.

______________________________________________________  TRANSLATION NOTES
Tensei no Honoo / Flame of Reincarnation
This is the literal translation.  If your dead allies were revived as
frogs, it might make sense :)  But in this case, I think 'tensei' is
supposed to mean 'ressurection' instead of 'reincarnation'.

Shurudan / Hand Pomegranate Bullet
Well, this is that actual kanji-by-kanji translation...  If you look at
the individual translations, you may think of a grenade.  In Japanese,
grenade is 'tekidan', which would fit the first and last kanji ('shu'
and 'ru', since shu can also be 'te'), but not the middle one.

Bomu no Migiude / Right Arm Bomb
Okay, believe it or not, this item has appeared in other FF games with
the exact same name.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe this
item is the right arm of the enemy you get it from (the little floating,
self-destructing creatures that are also in other FF games).

Wakiwashisou / Delusion Washi Weed
If you spell 'washi' using kanji, it means a type of thin rice paper.
I don't know what 'washi' is supposed to mean in this case, but think
about it...a weed wrapped in paper that causes delusions?  And 'sou'
can also be translated as 'herb'.  In other words, this is a joint!

Nankyoku no Kaze / Antarctic Wind
'Nankyoku' literally means 'north pole', but this item has been
translated as 'Antarctic' in previous FF games, so that's the word
I used.

Reiki no Ketsushou / Cold Binding Crystal
This is my best guess for the translation.  I'm sure that 'ketsushou'
spelled differently is a real word, but I don't know the correct way
to spell it in English.

Dengekitori no Tsuno / Electric Shock Bird Horn
You can win this item from the birds that cast thunder spells in the
Uutai area, so 'dengeki' (electrick shock) and 'tori' (bird) seem to
be correct.  I think 'tsuno' implies the type of horn you use to make
a sound (and summon others), not the horn of an animal.

Yuugaibutsushitsu / Harmfulness Material
As it is, the name basically means that this object has a harmful
quality (it poisons enemies).  As strange as this sounds, this is
the actual implication of the kanji.

Jikuudan / Space-Time Bullet
'Jikuu' is time and space, and 'dan' is bullet.  What this has to do
with casting a gravity-related spell is beyond me.  I recall there
being a magic series in FF5j called 'Jikuumahou' (Time-Space Magic)
that a class of magic users could learn, and I think the gravity spells
(Juuryoku) were part of that magic set.  However, I haven't played FF5j
in at least a year, so I'm not too sure.

Souryuu no Kiba / Fang of Dragon Pair
The literal translation of the kanji is 'Pair Dragon of Fang'.  Usually,
anything with 'no' in it is supposed to be rearranged, but even then,
the name of this item doesn't make much sense.  Of course, you do win
it from Twin Head (a two-headed boss monster), so 'Dragon Pair' isn't
_that_ far off from 'twin', I guess.

Misuriru Seibaa / Mithril Saber
'Mithril' is not a real substance, but it's used in video games a lot.
It was made up by a novelist named J. R. R. Tolkien, who published a
series of fantasy books some time ago.  'Misuriru' is simply the romaji
version of this word.

Riku x syukichikou / ?
With all but one kanji translated, you think I could figure this one
out.  As it is, none of the kanji go together, making the translation
'Land x Protect Good Luck Journey'.  I have my guesses as to what this
means, but until I can get the second kanji, I'm not going to hazard
a translation.

Daianakkuru / Daia Knuckle
It would make sense if 'daia' were short for 'diamond', but I recall
hearing somewhere that 'daia' is supposed to be an incredibly hard
substance found in the Final Fantasy universe.

Purachina Fist / Platinum Fist
Like 'Chitanbanguru' (see below), 'purachina' is a real word that
means 'platinum'.  Since most people aren't familiar with it, I
simply made a double translation and wrote it as 'platinum'.

Pairubankaa / Pile Banker
This weapon looks like a harpoon or grappling hook, yet it is not a
projectile weapon.  The translation 'Pile Banker' has no meaning, but
then what could the name of this weapon be?

Supurigankurippu / Spriggan Clip
Does anyone know if 'spriggan' is a real word?  That's what I translated
'supurigan' as, since I couldn't make it into any recognizable word.

Waizaaroddo / Wizier/Confusion Rod
I assume that 'waizaa' is translated as 'wizier' (also spelled with a
'v').  According to the online dictionary I use, it means 'confusion'.
Since this weapon doesn't confuse enemies in battle, I chose to list
both meanings until I can discover which one is appropriate.

Fiariiteiru / Fairy Tail
A play on words.  What's given above is the exact translation, but
'tale' is pronounced the same way in English (as in 'fairy tale').
Get it?  Ha, ha...ahem.

Ronginusu / Long Noose
My translation of this 'long noose' is probably wrong, but I can't think
of any other translation that fits.  Any ideas?

Biiansugosuperu / Venus Gospel
Yes, 'Venus Gospel' is the correct translation of this weapon's name.  As
is usual in Japanese games, two words having to deal with two distinctly
different things (the worship of Greek gods and Christianity) have been
put together to produce a nonsensical name.

Juuji Shuriken / Cross Throwing Star
This translation seems like it makes sense, but the individual kanji mean
something like 'ten characters'.  Anyone know more about this?   Of
interest only to me is the fact that the kanji for 'shuriken' translate
individually as something like 'hand inside blade'.

Manji Shuriken / Manji Throwing Star
Unlike 'Cross Throwing Star', the manji symbol has no real meaning (at
least not in present day terms).  But before you get worked up, keep in
mind that the first symbol is not a swastika.  While they look similar,
the manji is turned counter-clockwise, and was given it's name by
Japanese Buddhists, who have used the symbol for centuries to mean good
fortune and prosperity.

Fuuma Shuriken / Wind Demon Throwing Star
This translation would work, but a lot of people are familiar with
Japanese words like 'shuriken', or the names of swords 'Masamune',
'Murasame', 'Muramasa', so this weapon and the other two may simply
be more recognizable as 'Juuji/Manji/Fuuma Shuriken'.

Fugutaiten / Irreconcilable
The translation given is the direct one, but a more loose translation
would be something like 'I'll never agree' or 'ever-clashing enemies'.

Randaru, Raiatto, Bantorain
I'm assuming that these names (given in romaji) have English equivalents
(i.e. they're real guns).  Anyone know which ones?  Also, can anyone
figure out what the CR in 'Sniper CR' and the ST in 'Highbrow ST' stand
for?

Gin Tama Teppou / Silver Jewel Gun
The kanji for 'tama' means jewel or orb, but there's another kanji for
'tama' that means bullet.  I think the latter one would have made more
sense (as in Silver Bullet Gun), but I'm just translating what's there,
so....

Masamune / Quick Blood Rain
I heard this translation from someone else (can't remember who, but you
get credit, of course).  However, the translations of the two individual
kanji end up meaning something like 'point of justice' as in, the sword-
point of justice (see what I mean?  This translation is sort of like
gunslingers in the old West who made their own 'justice' by killing
others.  Doesn't make too much sense unless you know about these things).
I don't know which one is correct, though.

Chitanbanguru / Titanium Bangle
This is something of a modified translation, since 'chitan' is a word
in it's own right (it's Japanese for titanium).  This kind of pairing
('real' Japanese words with romaji) is common in Japanese words and is
a nightmare to translate if you don't realize that one word is in fact
a 'genuine' word.

Eijisu no Udewa / Aegis Bracelet
I have no idea if 'eijisu' is the romaji version of 'aegis' or not, but
it seems to fit.  The word 'aegis' comes from Latin, and was a shield
carried by the gods in Greek mythology.

Shinrayasushikibougu / Shin-Ra Relaxed Form Defense Tool
I couldn't make this into anything, so it's listed here translated
kanji by kanji.  Yes, the first two characters stand for 'Shin-Ra'
as in the group that you're fighting against.  I would assume that
'Relaxed Form' means that this bracelet is weaker than the other
bracelet below?

Shinrakoukeibougukai / Shin-Ra Armor Type Defend Tool Reform
This item has pretty much the same story as the first one.  From
the meanings of the kanji, it seems as if this bracelet is a
remade, stronger version of the 'shinrayasushikibougu'?

Retsuka no Udewa / Ardent Flame Bracelet
Literally, 'violent flame' bracelet.  No matter how you translate it,
I think retsuka is supposed to mean 'great fire' as in a bonfire or
large blaze, but 'ardent flame' seemed to be the closest I could get
without changing the meaning of the word.

Kyokukou no Udewa / Aurora Bracelet
Literally, 'pole light', or the Aurora Borealis (sp)?  Together,
the kanji for 'kyokukou' mean 'aurora'.

Tenrai no Udewa / Thunder Bracelet
Literally, 'heavenly/divine thunder', perhaps referring to the wrath
or might of the gods.  Together, the kanji for 'tenrai' mean 'thunder'.

Misutiiru / Myth Tear
I know this sounds wrong, but what else could you translate it as?

Boudan Chokki / ?
Well, the kanji for 'Boudan' translate loosely as 'bulletproof'
(literally, 'protect bullet'), but I can't figure out what 'chokki'
(in romaji) is supposed to mean.  I assume it's an article of clothing
or a piece of jewelry, but can't make any definite translations.

Eremesu no Kutsu / Hermes' Shoes
I thought this seemed correct, and it would fit according to the purpose
of the item (it makes your Time Bar go faster, and Hermes was a Greek
god said to be incredibly fast), but it doesn't sound exactly right.

Tetoraerementaru / Tetra-Element
For those of you who don't know, 'tetra-' is a prefix that means 'four',
which is the reason why this accessory protects you from the four basic
elements (fire, earth, etc.)

Nusuzoku no Shoute / Thief's Vulgar Little Hand
I doubt this is the correct translation, but the kanji used for this
item all have meanings that sound right.  Anyone care to translate this
for me?

Hyupunokuraun / Hypno-Crown
'Hypno' is short for 'hypnotic', which is obvious if you consider the
effect of this item (you have a higher success rate when using the
Control/Manipulate materia).

Kyougiri / Evil Omen Slash
This could also be 'Evil Behead', 'Bad Luck Murder' or 'Villan Kill',
depending on how you translate the kanji 'kyou' and 'zan (ki)'.  In the
FF7 demo disc, this was translated as 'Cross Slash'--which is completely
wrong.  During the Break, Cloud actually slashes out the kanji for
'kyou' with his sword (Evil Omen).

Hakougeki / Breaking Clear Attack
I'm not sure if 'clear' is supposed to mean that there's nothing around,
or that something can be seen clearly, but it makes sense when written
along with the other words.

Garyuutensei / Picture Dragon Finishing Touch
There's a old story in which a boy gets a magical paintbrush that will
make whatever he paints come to life.  The boy becomes a successful
artist by painting very lifelike pictures, which he always leaves
incomplete so the drawing doesn't spring to life and leave the paper.
To make a long story short, he finishes drawing a picture of a dragon
but a drop of ink from his brush lands on the paper; right where the
dragon' eye would be, completing the picture and revealing his secret
to everyone else when the dragon flies away.

...What this has to do with Cloud's Limit Break is beyond me, but
that's what the above kanji imply, so there you have it.  Edmond Chiu
suggests that Cloud is 'drawing' a picture with his sword, and the
enemies act like the 'eyes' of the picture.

Chokyuubushinhazan / Super Ultimate War God Champion Slash
Sounds strange, doesn't it?  All the kanji used to make up this word
are seperate, although you can pair 'bu' and 'shin' together.  My
take on this is a little incomplete, but here's some of the possible
meanings:

Kanji Breakdown of Cloud's Level 4 Limit Break

       Chou      Kyuu   Bu    Shin          Ha               Zan
Transcend/Hyper  Study  War   God/   Champion/Supreme  Behead/Kill
Super/Ultra                  Master                    Murder/Slash

Together, 'Bushin' means 'Army God'.  There is also a god of war called
Ashura.  If 'ha' were to mean 'champion', another implied meaning could
be 'the War God's Champion', as in, this person (the champion) is the one
who is attacking.

I'm not sure about 'study'.  Maybe it implies mastery through studying
the art of fighting/war?  Assuming the first kanji was 'transcend', it
could mean 'Transcending Knowledge' as in beyond understanding/more
important than the sum of all knowledge.

However, Edmond Chiu (who knows a lot more about kanji than I do),
suggests that the translation is "something like 'Super Ultimate War
God Champion Slash.'"  Sounds good to me.

Shoudarassyu / Palm of Hand Strike Rush
Well, rassyu (in romaji) translates as 'rush'.  But the two kanji that
make up 'shouda' have more than one meaning--I got 'palm of hand' from
'shou' and doubt if that's the correct translation (although it sounds
good in English :).

Hoshi no Shugo / Guardian Star
'Shugo' actually translates as 'protect' or 'safeguard', but it seemed
to me that 'guardian' would make more sense when written with 'star'.
I generally try to avoid putting my own spin on translations, so if you
don't like what I've written, use one of the other examples.

Seimei no Kodou / Life Beat
Obviously, what this is supposed to mean is 'heart beat', but then
again, 'life' and 'heart beat' are connected, so this isn't as strange
as it looks.

Ooinarufukuin / Great Word of God
Another translation would be 'Great Gospel'.  I wonder if this will be
translated exactly when the English version of FF7 is released? :)

Mekoushisui      / Clear Mirror, Still Water
Gaishuuichishoku / Armored Sleeves' One Touch
Seishahitsumetsu / All Living Human Must Perish
All these translations are according to Edmond Chiu, who explains that
Square used the kanji for both literal and meaningful purposes.  The
literal translations are: Bright Mirror Stop Water, Armed Shoulder One
Hit, and Life Person Inevitable Destroy.  Anyone know what 'Extract
Mountain Cover World' (Batsusangaisei) is supposed to mean?

Dairantou / Big Fray
Together 'ran' and tou' mean 'fray'.  I prefer their seperate
translations, which would make this word 'Big Riot War'.  Sounds
better, doesn't it?

 - The materia description acts as if this item has no holders.  You can
   only get this weapon by using the Item Select GS code (look elsewhere
   in the FAQ for details).  It appears with a handgun icon, as if it
   were a weapon for Vincent, but he cannot equip it.  Equipping it on
   Sephiroth is kinda useless since he already has one.

SHOPPING LIST
=========================================================================

This section is a list of each shop in the game and what you can purchase
there.  Please keep the following notation in mind:

Bracelet    - a bracelet anyone can wear.  'd' means 'Defense Power'
              and the number afterwards shows what your defense power
              will be changed to if this bracelet is equipped.  Next
              to that is a number and a letter; this indicates the
              number of Materia holders and whether they are single
              (s), or combined (c).
Weapon      - a weapon.  The name next to it indicates who can wield
              it.  'a' means 'Attack Power' and the number afterwards
              shows what your attack power will be changed to if this
              weapon is carried.  Next to that is a number and a
              letter; this indicates the number of Materia holders and
              whether they are single (s), or combined (c).  'None'
              means that that weapon has no Materia holders.

All the statistics below apply to all three discs.  If the goods for
sale or prices change from one disc to the next, then it will say
'(location) - DISC #' afterwards, which is why a location may be listed
more than once.

   released FF7 as an unfinished game.

   Waza' list, as well as various game tips.

   materia orbs.  Also translated the name for 'Kanjimaru', and gave

   This guy took the time to write the FF5 walkthrough, which saved a lot
   of us gamers from going insane trying to beat what is probably the
   hardest RPG ever made.  His work is what inspired me to write this FAQ
   in the first place.

*  Thanks also goes to Doctor976@aol.com and rupe@email.unc.edu for
   providing some info about getting Aerith's Limit Break, too).

*2 Also, thanks to Eddy <eddy@rica.net> for providing a link to
   phosphors' site soon after the instruction booklet was translated.

Anybody who sends me information that I don't already have (and can use
in the FAQ) is given credit in the Special Thanks section.  If I come
across some information that I'd like to use, I'll e-mail that person
and ask for permission.  However, if I don't get a response, then I'll
use it anyway.  So if you see your work up here and it says 'taken
without permission' that means that I've already e-mailed you asking
if I could use it.  I'm not trying to disrespect contributors, though,
and if this happens to you and you have a problem with it, drop me a
line...no offense is intended.  Also, if anyone in this section doesn't
want their e-mail address or URL shown, drop me a line and I'll gladly
change it in the next update.

Let's not forget the list of idiots!
 - J. Banks
 - fu1997@ix.netcom.com
 - Skankin Pickles
 - kairi@pixi.com

The first two sent my 'No Time Limit' code to other sites and took
credit from it--they copied the code description _word for word_ from
the FAQ.  Skankin Pickles decided he could rip from the walkthrough
more than once, and kairi@pixi.com sent his 'own' Body Heat code to a
FF7 site.  Had he made the code himself, he'd know why the title is
a little misleading :)  This list is supposed to discourage people
from doing this kind of thing.  It's not so they can see their names
in someone's FAQ!

                            11. AUTHOR'S NOTE

After writing fighting-game FAQs, doing this one really blew me away.
It's hard to get everything straight.  Be sure to read the introduction
to understand just how this FAQ is set up.  Also, some information in
this FAQ is taken from the translation of the FF7 instruction booklet
and is therefore written down word for word, even if there are spelling
or grammatical mistakes.  I _may_ make major changes to this FAQ when I
pick up the American version, but I may just keep everything the way it
is and start an 'English' FAQ instead.  Remember, you can't play this
game unless you use the 'swap' trick (there's info on how to do this at
CGN's web site listed above), or have a modification chip installed into
your PlayStation (unless you live in CA, I can't recommend a place to
you...you could always try NCS, though).  Furthermore, knowing Japanese
is a big help (not that I would know ;-)).

Well, the first page to rip from my FAQ finally called it quits.  That
doesn't mean this reminder is any less important; it is the reason why
I've had to change the disclaimer so many times.  Making this FAQ is
hard work and nothing but, so please acknowledge the author and
contributors if you use something from either part of the FAQ, okay?

That's that.
