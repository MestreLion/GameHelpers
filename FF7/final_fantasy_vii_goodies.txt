!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                             Introduction
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, here's a little FAQ on just the goodies in the game. What I mean by
goodies is the materia, limit breaks, ultimates, & much more.........
I know there are already HUGE FAQs on this, some that have to be.......
zipped!!!! But this should be used if you specifically want the extra goodies
because it is probably easier to find what you want without scrolling forever
and maybe more in-depth, possibly..... This is my first RPG FAQ, hope it
turns out well!!!!!! Also, this was made from the AMERICAN version. Most
of the ones out there are based on the japanese version, which aren't that
different at all, but just wanted to state that.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
                        3. Ruby and Emerald Weapons
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Both of the weapons have around 1,000,000 hit points and in my opinion are
MUCH harder than Sephiroth. Included will be just some basic strategies.

Emerald Weapon- Make sure to get the Underwater Materia before going against
him. Look in the materia section to see how to find it. Anyway, the best way
to beat him is probably to connect the X-Summon materia with the Knights
of the Round and other party members with Mimic materia. Makes sure to have
someone equipped with the all materia and Restore materia connected with it.
Also, connect the Final Attack Materia with the Phoenix so that you can come
back to life if he kills you. If you win, you will get an item. (I forget
its name.) Take it to the man in Kalm Town where you got the Underwater
Materia and trade it for the Master Green, Yellow, and Red Materia!!!!
Oh yeah, I never told where to find him!!! Just go around in the sub
in the area around Costa del Sol and Junon, be submerged in the water.
Just watch for a big green monster floating around and bump into him.

Ruby Weapon- Okay, now this time I'll put the location first. Go in the
Highwind and go to the desert area by the Gold Saucer. Fly into the red
thing pointing out and you will fight him. I say just do the same thing
as shown above. You will get an item, trade it to the guy in Kalm and
you will get a Gold Chocobo! (Personally, breeding one might be a bit
easier and he might be a little too hard without the Knights of the Round
Materia, which needs the Golden Chocobo to retrieve it.)

                        5. Chocobo Breeding Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1st, make sure you have a lot of money, around 200,000 gil before doing this.
Once you have the money, rent out all the stalls in the Chocobo Farm. They
cost 10,000 gil each and there are 6, so 60,000 gil total.

2nd, make sure you have the chocobo lure materia equipped. You want a running
female and walking male. Get the running female in the tracks west of Mideel
and the walking male in the tracks east of the Gold Saucer. Get them rated,
have a great female and good male. Save it now.

3rd, breed them with a Carob Nut which can be stolen from the dinosaur guys
by the Chocobo Sage's place. Have the chocobos breed and get either a green
or blue chocobo of either gender. You can breed both a green and a blue, but
I think that takes long. Just breed your newly born chocobo with another
yellow chocobo of opposite gender and you should get the chocobo of the other
color. Green + Yellow = Blue, Blue + Yellow = Green. Make sure your blue and
green chocobos are of opposite genders and save again.

4th, buy 40 Silkis greens. Feed 10 to both the Green and Blue chocobo.

5th, take them to the chocobo races and race until they are at the A-class.
Winning 3 races will raise them a class, 6 total wins in a row in the long
course to get them to the A-class.

6th, mate the green and blue with a carob nut to get a black chocobo!!
Feed it 10 silkis greens and race it to A-class.

7th, find a chocobo in the tracks in the snow in the Northern continent.
Make sure it has good health and opposite gender of the black one. Feed
it 10 Silkis Greens and race it to A-class.

8th, go to Goblin Island, which is just northeast of the chocobo farm and
steal a Zeio Nut from them.

9th, breed the black and chocobo from snow area with the Zeio Nut and you
will get the Golden Chocobo!!!! You can now get some of the best Materia
in the game, like the Knights of the Round!!!!
