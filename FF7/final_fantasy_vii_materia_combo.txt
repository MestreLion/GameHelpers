INTRODUCTION
************

Ok, so I'm very tired and very bored. I've decided to write an FFVII Materia
Combo/Setup Guide. These setups are mainly for people that have already
beaten the game and just want to have a bit of fun smoking Sephiroth at the
end. Or, maybe, if some people contribute, they can be used to advance
in the game more easily with the use of some useful materia combos or setups.
With this in mind, let's move on...

You can find the latest updates of this FAQ as well as some other FAQs I've
written at http://www.gamefaqs.com

                Fixed an embarrassing typo in the introduction. Don't worry,
                you probably don't get it, but if you were me, you'd probably
                be embarrassed too ^_^
                ...And check it out, some ASCII art! Heh...I bet you're just
                overjoyed ^_^ Geez, sorry, it's one of my firsts, I'm trying
                here, people!!

12/19/98: v.1.0. Just starting.

WEAPON/ARMOR: MP Absorb-Master Summon/Knights of the Round, MP Turbo-Master
              Summon/Knights of the Round

WEAPON/ARMOR: Sneak Attack-Knights of the Round, MP Turbo-Knights of the

        Start a battle with a Knights of the Round that deals 129,987 damage.
        The HP <--> MP materia should allow for enough MP to keep doing this
        over and over again.

WEAPON/ARMOR: Sneak Attack-Knights of the Round, MP Absorb-Knights of the
              Round/Master Summon

**************
MATERIA SETUPS
**************

The Sephiroth:
        Total Slots Required: 12
        Linked Materia Slots Required: 12

WEAPON/ARMOR: Fire-All, Earth-All, Ice-All, Lightning-All, Final
              Attack-Revive, Master Magic-MP Absorb

This is _close_ to how Sephiroth is equipped. I know Sephiroth doesn't use
fire, all magic, and doesn't revive when dead. However, the Fire-All would
complete his elemental attacks that target all opponents. He deserves every
spell since he _is_ a dedicated magic user, and normally he can't get hurt
so the best way to go is to not make him die ^_^

Ultima:
        Total Slots Required: 12
        Linked Materia Slots Required: 12

WEAPON/ARMOR: Ultima-MP Absorb, Ultima-HP Absorb, Ultima-Sneak Attack,
              Ultima-MP Turbo, Ultima-Quad Magic, Ultima-Final Attack

This can be done with any Magic Materias, but I thought was best effective
with Ultima and Contain (I just chose Ultima because it targets all enemies).
It will enable you to cast a super-powered Ultima 4 times while absorbing HP
and MP at the same time. Not too shabby, eh?

The Summoner:
        Total Slots Required: 13
        Linked Materia Slots Required: 12

WEAPON: Knights of the Round-MP Turbo, Final Attack-Phoenix, Master Summon-MP
        Absorb, Elemental-(Your favorite elemental summon)

ARMOR: Quad Magic-Hades, Sneak Attack-Choco/Mog, W-Summon

This takes advantage of the powerful summon spells. You have all summons
available to you and absorb MP when you cast them. When you are low on MP,
you can cast Knights of the Round to regain it all again while dealing the
maximum amount of damage to your opponents. You also begin a battle with
Choco/Mog, which can paralyze some opponents. You will have an element in your
weapon, and your final attack will deal fire damage to all opponents while
reviving all party members to full HP.

Ultimate Character:
        Total Slots Required: 14
        Linked Materia Slots Required: 6

(Ultimate Weapons and Mystiles/Escort Guards Recommended)

NOTE: THESE MATERIAS SHOULD BE MASTERED FOR BEST EFFECT

WEAPON/ARMOR: Master Magic, W-Magic, MP Absorb-Master Summon, MP
              Turbo-Knights of the Round, Master Command, Enemy Skill,
              W-Summon, Slash-All, Mega All, HP Plus, Final Attack-Phoenix

This is perhaps the best Materia Setup you can have in the game. Since I have
no life, I have equipped this setup on *ALL* of my characters (Yeah, I'm sick,
huh?). The Master Magic gives a character all the spells, while W-Magic lets
you use two spells in one turn. The Master Command activates most commands,
and a mastered Enemy Skill will give you some nice spells (Big Guard anyone?).
The Slash-All (Mastered), will give you Flash, which can instantly kill all
opponents. The HP Plus should boost your characters HP up to 9999. The famous
"Knights of the Round causes 129,987 damage each time it is cast, while
absorbing abnormal amounts of MP" is also here, and you can cast it twice with
the W-Summon enabled. The Final Attack-Phoenix protects your entire party from
death while dealing Fire damage to all opponents. Wicked, huh? ^_^

The Counterer:
        Total Slots Required: 14
        Linked Materia Slots Required: None

(Best used with Yuffie with a Mystile and her Conformer against Emerald
WEAPON).

WEAPON/ARMOR: HP Plus, Cover, Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack,
Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter
Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack, Counter Attack

This is how I beat Emerald WEAPON. I equipped this on Yuffie with her
Conformer. Every time someone was hit, she would block for them and counter
12 times, each attack doing 9999 damage (119,988 total).

Master Commando (Get it?! Get it!?!?):
        Total Slots Required: 14
        Linked Materia Slots Required: 12

WEAPON/ARMOR: Master Command-HP Absorb, Master Command-MP Absorb, Master
Command-Steal as Well, Master Command-Added Cut, Master Command-Command
Counter, Master Command-Sneak Attack, Cover, Double Cut/Slash-All

DESCRIPTION: ...when linking Master Command with any blue (support) materia,
and the character also has 2x-Cut/Slash-All will have the effect of the blue
materia. For example, if I link Master Command with HP Absorb, and then in
battle, I attack with 2x Cut, I absorb HP. *NOTE* I know this makes no sense
at all, and I have no idea why this works. --SETUP AND DESCRIPTION
CONTRIBUTED BY KAINDADRAGOON@YAHOO.COM--

WEAPON Killer:
Linked Slots: 6
Total Slots:16
Recommended Weapon: Any Ultimate Weapon
Recommended Armor: Wizard Bracelet (mostly for its high Magic Defence and 8
linked slots)

WEAPON/ARMOR: Enemy Skill(Big Guard), Mime, Final Attack-Phoenix, MP
Turbo-Knights of the Round, HP Absorb-Master Summon, Underwater (If facing
Emerald WEAPON), HP Plus, Master Command, Master Magic-Quadra Magic,
W-Summon, W-Magic, Mega All

This is my favorite combination to use once you have it all.  If you want to
fight those American Creatures, All you have to do is have a mime on your
other two characters and you can cast two Knights of the Round for 13,000
damage and gain back around 7000 hp and keep doing it over and over. The
underwater materia stops the timer on Emerald Weapon and if your not facing
one of the bosses, your still have about everything you could want.  I have
yet to find a better setup than this. --SETUP AND DESCRIPTION CONTRIBUTED
BY ZOMBIE MAT--

Hell Knight:

Linked Slots: 14
Total Slots: 16
Recommended Weapon: None
Recommended Armor: Wizard Bracelet

WEAPON/ARMOR: Quad-Magic-Fire, MP Turbo-Fire, MP Absorb-Fire, HP Absorb-Fire,
Added Cut-Fire, Added Steal-Fire, Magic Counter-Fire, W-Magic, Magic Plus


It's pretty obvious..with one casting, you get 8 Fire 3s, two attacks, 8 steal
attempts, and end up with a lot more HP and MP than you started with.  The
Magic Counter is just there to add some extra bang to it.  I killed the Dragon
Zombie in the last cave with this, before the combo was even halfway through,
and I hadn't even had my turn yet!  Personally, I think this beyond-evil combo
is the best in the game.   If you dont have enough Fire materia at level 3,
you can drop the Absorbs and the Turbo.  --SETUP AND DESCRIPTION CONTRIBUTED
