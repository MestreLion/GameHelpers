             Only a prophecy kept hope alive the people's hearts.

     "When darkness veils the world, four warriors of light shall come."

       And after journeying far, four young warriors did at last appear
             In the hands of each rested a mysterious crystal...

==============================================================================

Yoho... This is Fox again. The guide is, as it seems, is done. I will still
accept e-mails that would help me in this guide but whatever. If you're
wondering why you should use this guide over others, due to the sudden boom
of new FFO guides. I'll tell you why... it doesn't have some detailed 
explanations on POINTLESS stuff. Like how to attack or use magic. Whatever,
dude. I mean, you already know this stuff (right?) This makes the access to
the walkthrough VERY SHORT and FAST. Plus, my walkthrough is very detailed, 
giving you info to every chest you need for the collection. I know my guide 
might not out-shine others in the terms of KB but this has the NECESSARY 
information and I feel that I display it in the best method. So sue me for 
trying to pull people to use my guide. *shrugs*

The Walkthroughs are on the top, the stupid lists and that crap are on the
bottom. Makes sense to me, crap should be in the bottom.

Keep the praises and threats coming! I appreciate them more than you think!

Here's an e-mail from my favorite secret admirer:

"Fooled your ass you little mental defective!!!

You think thieves are puny rats?! Guess what!?
Screw your ass you little crap!!!
Quick but worthless?!?! What kind of friggin retard are you!?
I should find out where you live and kill you!!!
You call yourself a final fantasy fan! LOL
I hope you get drafted to a war and get your limbs blown off!!!"

Hilarious stuff. Here's a little-known fact from me: I'm deaf (No, I am not
shitting you.) and the United States does not let handicapped people like us
(like we're actually HC anyway) into the army so no limbs picking for me. :)
And no, I do not want any "Oh you're deaf? I'm sorry!" crap, please.

Please do free to critique my FAQ or submit a new info for my Walkthrough or
Secrets. As for the questions... I won't guarantee you that I will respond to
them... That's all I can say for that matter. If you're wondering where's the
Boss section for FF2, I decided to not include it because it all depends on
how much you trained beforehand so it doesn't require much strategy. They're
in the guide anyway. FF1 has some tough bosses if you don't know what to do
so I included them.

Peace out and happy gaming.

                        -----------------------------
==============================================================================

I'll be really quick here... No need to write down POINTLESS info... that you
should know already. If you do want more info, please do look in some other
guide. Besides, I want the distance between the start and the walkthrough to 
be short. There ya go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  CONTROLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  X--------------------Select/confirm
  Circle---------------Cancel/dash (hold)
  Square---------------Go to the Items Menu (not in battles)
  Triangle-------------Main Menu
  Start----------------None
  L1-------------------Equipment Menu
  L2-------------------Config Menu

  R2-------------------Memo File


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   SAVING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only ways to save into your memory card: use an Inn or use a Sleeping Bag/
Tent/Cottage. Simple as that. 

However, you could save into your disk with the new Memo File system. This
way, you could quickly save ANYWHERE so when you die, you can come back at 
that point... The catch? The file will be lost once you turn off the console.
To save on your Memo File, just go to the Main Menu and select Memo. You
could Soft Reset and go to the 'Memo File' at the Start screen to 'restart'
your game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  CLASSES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you start a new game, you will have to chose a class for each of your
characters. They will be that way forever, until the very end. There are six
classes in all, each with their advantages and disadvantages. They can get
'evolved' into a new class. Here they are:

Warrior -> Knight
-----------------
-Most powerful class
-Wields swords, the best weapons
-High HP
-High Defense
-No Magic (Warrior)
-Low Speed
-Knight can use Level 1-3 White Magic

Thief -> Ninja
--------------
-Thief is a puny, weak rat
-Quick but worthless
-Ninja: one of the best fighters in the game
-Wields some Swords (Ninja)
-Can use some Black Magic
-Overall, starts off weak but finishes strong

Monk -> Master
--------------
-High number of attacks
-High damage
-HIGH HP
-No Swords or Armor (except for the Masamune)
-Low Defense (Def = Monk's Lv!)
-No Magic at all
-Master is not a big upgrade

Red Mage -> Red Wizard
----------------------
-Strongest Mage/Wizard in terms of Strength
-Has plenty of Magic
-Black and White magic are the same to him
-Uses swords
-Fairly low MP
-Has better stats than White and Black Mages/Wizards, mostly

White Mage -> White Wizard
--------------------------
-Can use the entire arsenal of White Magic
-High MP
-Only thing other than Sanctuary, RM than can revive fallen characters
-Can use Holy
-Low stats other than INT and MP
-Can't attack except for Dia spells and Holy

Black Mage -> Black Wizard
--------------------------
-Sometimes the most damaging member in the party
-Attacks the entire squads of enemies with his magic
-Able to cast Haste and Saber two vital magic
-Lowest HP of all classes


So... what's the best party? In my opinion... A White Mage is a must. As for
the Black magic, either a Red Mage or a Black Mage will be fine. Go for Red
Mage, tho. The other two slots? Stick with a Fighter and one more attacker
(Fighter/Monk/Thief). 

I had: Fighter, Fighter, Black Mage, White Mage. Not bad.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EASY AND NORMAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-At Level 50, Your BW and WW will have 99 MP on Easy while in Normal, they 
 only have NINE!!!! BIG DIFFERENCE!

-Shopkeepers are much, much nicer to you. Therefore, the items are cheaper.

-Magic too. Lucky you!

-Your characters needs less EXP to level up in the Easy Mode. In fact, you 
 get 40% off.

-In easy Mode, you max out at Level 99. In Normal.... only 50.

Your choice. Normal mode isn't that hard anyway.

(The following is not related to the Normal/Easy mode but it's still nice to
know)

-Some other stuff: in FF1 on NES, you had to choose to attack and that was it.
 I know that's too vague... Let me explain: If there's 4 Goblins in the
 enemy party, and you select 'Attack' for all of your characters... AND you
 decide to attack the top Goblin for every character. OK, your Fighter or
 whatever attacks... and kills the pathetic enemy. The other guys will
 still whiff at the thin air, where the former Goblin was located. It took
 the old-school gamers a LOT more planning back then! Today, it's just another
 one, chosen automatically by the CPU AI.

-The names are different, of course. In NES, Water Naga is known as Naga. 
 Marilith here was (I think) Kary. (Thanks, Derag, I thought Kary were Kraken!
 XD!)

-The HP are different, too. The final boss has 2000 HP in NES, but 4000 HP
 on PSX. Weird.

                          =-----------------------=
                          CHAPTER 1 - THE BEGINNING
                          =-----------------------=
Recommended Level: 1 (Yeah, duh)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   ========
                                   Cornelia
                                   ========

OMG!!!! Look at that SHINY crystal!!!! I want the blue one! I bet it'll fetch
me a LOT of dead presidents!!! *snaps out of the trance* Oh! Oh, hi! Yeah, 
well, I'm writing a walkthrough for Final Fantasy... and Final Fantasy II, too
I hope. Anyway, Pick your honorable characters, which will devote their lives
to you. I picked two Warriors, a White Mage, and a Black Mage. You know, you
get to name them! Whoo! I called my Warriors Fox and Neo, my White Mage Slut69
and called my very sexy Black Mage Jesus. And yes, I did call my White Mage 
"Slut69". 

Moving on...

You start off outside the little town of Cornelia, which, naturally, has a 
castle along with it. You start off with only 400 Gil but it's enough for some
half-way decent armor... You could fight the enemies around your house for 
some EXP and more importantly, Gil, but let's go to the king himself right 
now.

Go through the town and enter the majestic castle. Go straight to the nearest
set of stairs and go up the stairs. Talk to the wimp guard up ahead, when you
get to 2F. He will allow you in after debating with himself if the group is 
the Light Warrior squad. (What kind of security is that, for a king? Bleh.)
After entering the King's throne room, he will exclaim that you are the 
warriors after seeing the precious crystals. (dunno where they got those...)
He demands you to find her daughter, the Princess Sarah from a evil do-er up
north (that's Garland, for your information). In exchange for her rescue, he
will force his sex slaves to make a bridge for you to cross. Guess we have to
start somewhere...

Now, go back to the outside world and breathe the fresh air... Go into the 
village of Corneria and buy some Equipment for now. You don't have a lot of
money but the equipment is cheap... for now. Wait until you see the magic's
prices!!! You could buy some level one spells here in this very town... 
100 Gil for Normal Level, 50 Gold for Easy level. I recommend buying Fire1
and Bolt1 for your Black Mage or Red Mage, if you have either one. For your
White Mage or Red Mage, buy Cure1. The other spells are up to you... 

After buying some decent magic spells and equipment, I suggest you to head 
to the over world and train until you reach level 3 or MAYBE 4. Won't take 
long to get to level 3 so don't worry. If you want to go to level 4 it's 
going to take you a LONG time... If you need some healing, there's an Inn 
in the town (30 Gil). You can save at the Inn, too (can't save in the 
over world except for the Sleeping Bags, Tent, and Cottages... you actually
have to pay to save in the Inn!).

If you want some quick level-ups, go into the castle up to the north, where
we're going to...

The enemies here are very difficult to defeat with all that misses your damn
warriors have. (*coughLightWarriors?blahcough*) However, their EXP is more 
than worth it. The Goblins only offer 5~7 EXP but the wolf squads in this
temple offers 60+ EXP... Quick but tough. Get to level 3 (might take a few 
tries, deaths might hinder you, but keep going) and try to get all three 
items in the rooms to the northwest and to the southwest. Get to level 3 by 
fighting a battle and going back to the Inn, if needed. The map above will 
aid you in finding the items and the boss. 

Go to the middle of the temple and look for a door leading to the heart of the
room. Garland! (If you've played FFIX, you would know of a Garland in that 
game... That Garland is a 'cameo' of this Garland. Not the same Garland, but
it's just a name thing like Cid.) Looks like Garland is a vampire or 
something, with all that bats flying around aimlessly. Who's that sexy woman?
Oh! The princess? What's this creep doing with the girl? Naughty man...

____________
BOSS:Garland
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 106
EXP: 130

  Magic is ALMOST useless... except for Fire1. So cast Fire with your BM. For
  the rest of the classes, attack. WM or RM should heal every time the boss 
  attacks. Not too hard, but if you haven't trained up to level 3, you're in 
  trouble. Hell, with my Lv 3 Fighters (2), Lv 3 WM, and a Lv 2 BM, I beat 
  this creep in 2 rounds. TOO EASY.

Boo-yeah! The chick is saved! She leads you back to her father, the King of
Cornelia. The King appreciates your hard work and tells of a 'Lukin' (sounds
like a prophet) and asks you to 'rekindle' the crystals... He keeps the 
promise and rebuilds the bridge... Before leaving the castle, talk to Princess
Sarah at least once to get a key item: LUTE. 

Go to an Inn and save your game... Leave Cornelia and cross the bridge to
begin your adventure!!! A nice cut scene, I might add.

                       =------------------------------=
                       CHAPTER 2 - THE ADVENTURE STARTS
                       =------------------------------=
Recommended Level: 3~4 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, well, well... The actual adventure starts here. The preceding chapter is
more like a prologue than a chapter. Your mission here is to go to Pravoca, a
town to the east. As you come up to a set of mountains, take the path to the
right to get to the town. However... I would recommend you to take a trek to 
the LEFT. That winding path leads you to a damp cave of Matoya's, where I will
begin this chapter.

                                =============
                                Matoya's Cave
                                =============
Items: 
------
Antidote; Potion; Potion
------

If you don't know where this damn place is, just go back to the bridge just
north of Cornelia and take the first left you see and walk past the bay. 
Continue walking on the forest path until you see an isolated cave on the 
peninsula. Matoya's Cave! WARNING: the monsters en route to that cave is
VERY tough for lower level-ers. I recommend, if you're going, that you save
on your Memo File beforehand.

In the cave, open the door to meet Mister Matoya himself. He will blabber 
about something like 'Crystal Eye'... Whatever that means, (you will find out
what that means pretty soon) it does not matter right now. He can wait, we
have to save the world! Don't ever forget that! Hah... (Why are we here in
this pointless cave anyway?) Oh, back to the point... Loot his room and take
the POTION, POTION, and ANTIDOTE from the chests to the left. 

Note: If you talk to the magical brooms, they will say this:

"Flipp'er over, flip, flip!
Elcric dn'a trats!"

It is quite simple to figure this out... The broom said 'flip' THRICE. He
must be implying something. Try flipping over the last sentence? What do you
get? Yes, this: "start a'nd circlE" The ' in the 'and' is just there to throw
you off. What does that mean? Just go to the over world and press those buttons
to discover the hidden meaning.

After this short (but according to my length of writing, it is otherwise) 
segment, head back to the fork in the mountains to the south.


                                   =======
                                   Pravoca
                                   =======

To get to this crappy mini-city, go all of the way east until you get to a
dead end. When you do, drop down and you should find Pravoca, sitting comfy
next to a body of water. Enter, of course.

Make sure you revive and heal your party members first, if necessary. After
that, I recommend you to buy Ice (400-Normal 250-Easy Gil) for your
BM or RM. As for the White Magic, there isn't a lot of good magic, but if you
really want to spend some cash on those, you might want Invis1 or NulBolt.
The rest of the cash should go to the weapons and armor. 

After all of that crap, go to the northwestern house and talk to the pirate
leader, in the middle. This will anger the leader and trigger a battle with
NINE pirates! Ack! I should have never spoke to him!


_____________
BOSS: Pirates
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 6 each
EXP: 40 each

  Bah... only 6 HP per guy? That's like nothing... But if you're having some
  trouble, just vanquish them with a successful hit of 'Sleep' from your RM
  or BM. Otherwise, just endure their attacks and kill them one by one. 


After defeating them all, the pirate boss will panic frantically so much that
he gave up his coveted SHIP! I won't give a huge ship that easy myself! Heh...
Now, you can either train a bit more or just go ahead and use that ship 
outside Pravoca, all ready for you.

NOTE: While on the Ship, hold down the Circle Button and tap the X button 55
times. If you do this, the mini-game, "Concentration" will show up. For more
information, refer to the Secrets section.


                                   ========
                                   The Ship
                                   ========

ALL ABOARD!!!!!!! Let's get on the ship!!! Now, you were never told where to go
but that's okay, I still love you. :) First of all, let's just train some and
battle with the sea monsters. Yep, you will encounter monsters even on a ship
drifting away in the sea. Where to go? Just head to the west, to Cornelia. 
While this town have nothing to offer to you as of now, it is pretty important
to use that town as the board because of its cheap fare. (30 Gil for an Inn,
40 Gil for a revive) The monsters in the sea are very tough but offers a lot
of experience points so seize this chance to level up to maybe 5 or even 6,
if you are patient enough. An upcoming cave is tough as nails, so you have to
be prepared to make it through... Best wishes to all of you...

(If you're lost trying to find where Cornelia is, just press Circle and Start
to bring the World Map. There ya go... :) )

After leveling up in the waters around Cornelia and harboring at the village
to heal, get on your ship and head south. Dead south. Just enjoy the ride all
of the way to the next shoreline. When you finally reach the next piece of
land, go left a bit to reach yet another harbor/port/wharf (whatever floats
your boat... OMG!!!!!! I GOT THE BEST PUN EVAR!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!)

The enemies, once again, here are pretty tough, especially that infamous ogre.
Just pummel him with normal attacks once you see him, if ever. Continue 
walking to the south until you see yet another castle surrounded by some
pathetic houses. Please do enter that village.


                                   =======
                                   Elfheim
                                   =======

There are a TON of stuff you can buy from this place! There are LVL 3 AND 4
magic in this village, all excellent magic. I recommend you get Cure2, Dia2,
and Heal1 for your WM. As for your BM or RM, maybe level 2 attack spells would
work (Bolt2, etc) and don't forget to grab 'Haste' in the LVL 4 Black Magic 
shop, very useful in boss battles. Last but not least, go to the Weapon Shop
to pick some nifty stuff for your physical fighters. I got TWO Mythril Sword
for 8000 Gil, they ROCK! (got the money via the ship mini-game) Don't forget
to revive or/and heal if you need.

(A NEAT thing: go to the tombstones behind the inn and press X on the left one
and see what it says... "May Link rest in peace" Don't get it? This place is
filled with Elves and Link himself is an elf... Still don't know who he is?
The protagonist of the LEGENDARY series, the Legend of Zelda. A neat easter
egg!)

Anyway, let's go to the castle now...


                                 ============
                                 Elven Castle
                                 ============

Ah, a nice castle. Wonder if Link ever saw this castle? (Hyrule Castle, 
anyone?) Just go up the stairs and take the left path after the dead end. Go
into the room to the northwest. You see a beauty lying on the bed and the
prince charming watching over him... (kiss her, dammit!) Talk to the prince
charming and he will say that someone named Astos cursed the prince (oh, SHE'S
a HE? XD) So... do we have to find this Astos guy? Yea, guess so...

Leave the castle and head due west. You will come upon a little path through
two set of mountains, and go into that valley. Beware of Ghasts in this area,
their attacks include the ability to paralyze you, so kill them quickly with
your powerful fighters. The monsters here in this valley are abundant and gives
you plenty of EXP. An average battle here could land you about 120 EXP so you
should train around here a bit since it's pretty close to the nearest village
in case you get too weak. 

Anyway, there are two places to go right now, but only one of them is 
required. The other one is optional, but I recommend you to go there because
the required cave, the Marsh Cave, is VERY tough and you need every EXP you 
can get. The 'optional' location is to the northwest, along the shoreline to
the west. If you're going there, skip the next paragraph. (to the Western
Keep)

If you want to ignore or have completed surveying the optional castle, go 
south of the Castle and stick to the shoreline, all of the way to the end
of this continent. It is a long trek from the Elfheim or the optional castle,
so you should be healed before the journey. Also, it is a VERY good idea to
bring some cottages or sleeping bags (bought from some shops).


                                 ============
                                 Western Keep
                                 ============

As of right now, you cannot get any items but it is worth the trip because
you must have gathered a lot of EXP up to this point from Elfheim. You might
get mad at me because it was very difficult to get to this point (for some),
but do not grieve... you will thank me later when you reach the Marsh Cave, 
especially if you're playing on the Normal Mode. 

What to do here? Just enter the room in the middle via the door to your left
when you enter this keep. You will meet the king of this bat-filled (Dracula?)
castle. He will request you abruptly to retrieve a crown from the southern
marsh. That's where we're going to go! Onward!


                                  ==========
                                  Marsh Cave
                                  ==========
Items: 
------
Broadsword; Steel Plate; Cottage; Copper Amulet; Dagger; Crown; Gil
******
Monsters:
------
Anaconda; Zombie; Black Widow; Werewolf; Bloodbones; Warg Wolf; Crawler;
Tarantula; Shadow; Skeleton; Gargoyle; Ghoul; Gray Ooze; Scorpion; Green 
Slime; Piscodemons
******

This place is basically a hole in the ground, obviously, as this place is
shown as a black hole in the world map. As you're supposed to do, enter this
tough cave. 

In this cave, you could go north, but I don't recommend it because you would
find some Gil (680 Gil and 620 Gil) and two items that could be found to the
south! Doesn't sound good, does it? So let's go to the south. The stairs to
the B2F is in a room, so you have to enter it from the southern door. The path
to the east leads to nothing but monsters.

B2F: Pretty simple floor, if you want items. To the left, there is a room with
a chest filled with 680 GIL. The two rooms to the right of that room, has the
same treasure, but there's a catch: if you open one of those chests, the other
chest will be empty so pick one! The item will be a BROADSWORD. After 
uncovering those items, go to the southeastern corner to go down to B3F. 

B3F: This floor has a LOT of items! That's why I decided to make a map of this
place! The chests with a STEEL PLATE inside will disappear if you open one of
the other chests with Steel Plate inside so you only have to pick one (best 
one: the northwest room). I recommend you to pick up the COTTAGE and COPPER 
ARMLET, before going to the room with the crown inside. If your party is too
weak to go on, make a quick exit back outside and use your cottage/sleeping
bag, if you have one. If you don't... good luck making all of the way to
Elfheim!

   -----'-----'----------'----'---------'----'---------'--'-----

   E: Entrance/Exit of B3F
  SP: Steel Plate (choose one, only one will be retrieved)
  CA: Copper Armlet
   C: Cottage
 385: 385 Gil
 295: 295 Gil
  SA: Silver Armlet (must have Mystic Key)
  MK: Mythril Knife (Mystic Key)
1020: 1020 Gil (Mystic Key)
BOSS: The boss battle and the Crown


After all that battling and item-collecting, go to the second room from the
left and the bottom. Upon entering the room, you should be able to see a chest
surrounded by some mystical statues... Must be something special. Before 
opening the chest, however, heal your party up... because it's time for a...

________________
BOSS: Piscodemon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 84 (each)
EXP: 276 (each)

  Every time you step on the panel just before the chest, you fight this
  Piscodemon squad. You could fight up to 4, but most of the time, there's 3 
  of them. Each monster has only 84 HP, but they are tough because of their 
  tough shell and their attacks have high damage. Bolt is very good against 
  them so use it, if you have it. I fought three of those and my Warriors 
  beat them up along with my BM's Bolt1, and finished them off in 2 rounds...
  Only got hit once. Later in the game, you will encounter those jerk-offs
  as a normal enemy! Scared now?

After beating the enemies, do not move! Just stand there and open the chest. 
Alas! The CROWN! Now you have to walk all of the way back to the over world!
You should know the way...

Once in the over world, you might want to use an cottage or sleeping bag for
the safety's sake. Either way, go back to Elfheim to heal up 100% and save!
OMG... This is a tough trip, indeed. 

After getting back up 100%, go back to the Western Keep to meet that 
mysterious king once again.


                                 ============
                                 Western Keep
                                 ============
                              Items: Crystal Eye


Once you arrive at this castle for the second time, (if you've visited this
place before going into the Marsh Cave) you should be at least LVL 7. Yes, I
know that this place has no monsters, but... you will fight a boss! Just go
up to the guy and give him the crown. He will laugh maniacally and reveal his
true image:

___________
BOSS: Astos
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 168
EXP: 2250 (yay!!!)

  This boss is very strong and has a good-sized health points. This boss has
  a lethal spell: Reaper. This move = instant kill, so be very afraid! A good0
  way to win is with Haste (will only work if you're LVL 8). Have your RM or 
  BM cast Haste on your strongest fighters and pummel him with attacks. Your 
  RM or WM should heal EVERY time with Cure2. The boss has level 2 magic 
  spells so he will damage every member of your party. Strong, yes, but not
  tough. Fire2 or Bolt2 could easily damage him heavily (60 points!). Finish
  him off with attacks from your physical fighters.

  If you're having some trouble, you can clamp him down with Silence.

You will receive the CRYSTAL EYE after defeating Astos. Congrats! There's 
nothing to do as of now so let's go back to your ship!


                                =============
                                Matoya's Cave
                                =============
                              Items: Jolt Tonic


Go back to Elfheim if you need to heal and some reviving (is that a word?).
Get on your ship and sail north, toward Cornelia. However, don't stop at the
port south of Cornelia... Just go around and go under the bridge that the
loyal king made for you. You will find another port north of the bridge. Use
that to get off to dry land. Walk further north to find... the Matoya's Cave!
Remember this nut case? ^_^ And yes, his magic brooms are still here! Woo-hoo!

Go up to Matoya and give your Crystal Eye to him (her? Who knows) and he will
give you the JOLT TONIC in the exchange. Guess that'll wake the Prince up...

Let's get back to the ship and ride the casbah back to the Elfheim, where the
sleeping beauty is waiting for thee...


                                 ============
                                 Elven Castle
                                 ============
Items:
------
Mystic Key; Mythril Hammer; Bronze Gloves; 400 Gil; 330 Gil; Bronze Gloves
------

Alright, let's cut to the chase and wake that poor guy! Walk up to the servant
(I think he's a pervert!) and talk to him. He will exclaim and grab your Jolt
Tonic away from you and use it to wake his lover up. The prince will talk like
he's in a dream... Anyway, he gives you the MYSTIC KEY, a rare item that will
open up some locked doors. Let's LOOT!!!!!!

First place to loot: here! Yay! get out of the castle but not the castle 
grounds... Just get out via the stairs to the southeast or southwest. Stick to
the wall and walk around the castle until you see an isolated room. That's 
your first use for the Mystic Key! In that room, therein lies a MYTHRIL 
HAMMER, BRONZE GLOVES, 400 GIL, and 330 GIL. Easy! 

Let's loot some more!

                                  ==========
                                  Mystic Key
                                  ==========
Items:
------
Western Keep: Steel Gloves; Power Staff; Falchion

Marsh Cave: Silver Armlet; Mythril Knife; 1080 Gil

Temple of Chaos: Werebane; Rune Blade; Gold Needle
------


Those items that you can get, listed above, are optional. Some items I do 
recommend, but others... I do not. Nevertheless, I do think you should get
some rather than none. Let's proceed.

First, go to the Western Keep to get those treasures: STEEL GLOVES, POWER
STAFF, and FALCHION. I recommend getting them, especially if you're low on
money. They are valuable stuff, ya know. Before getting them, just don't
step on the spaces right front of the chests. Doing so will trigger a fight...
not too tough, but annoying. If you really do want those fights (with Mummies
and Wraiths), be my guest.

Next... the next nearest place is the Marsh Cave. What does that stupid cave
have in its chests? SILVER ARMLET, 1080 GIL, and MYTHRIL KNIFE. I do NOT
recommend getting those. Why? First, you have to trek all of the way to the
cave, and that's long. Then you have to scale down all of the way to B3F and
that's EXTRA long! THEN... you have to go find the rooms and FIGHT yet another
monster to get the treasure! The monsters? The Piscodemons, the monster that
you fought to get the Crown! Isn't that ANNOYING!?!?! Chances are, you might
die on the way if you're not careful. Those items are good, but not worth the
trouble at all. If you want to there anyway, use the map I made up above for
B3F of Marsh Cave... All of the items are there. Besides, you will get those
items soon, in someplace else. However, if you want the 100% Collection rate,
you'll have to grab them.

Lastly, the final place to go before getting back on the storyline: the 
Temple of Chaos. You know, the palace where you fought the first boss, 
Garland. Land just under Cornelia Castle and go north to the temple. The 
treasures are to the northeast and southeast. And yes, I do recommend getting
those items because it's not even a hassle. The items: WEREBANE, RUNE BLADE,
and GOLD NEEDLE. The weapons (Werebane and Rune Blade) are actually good, so
it's worth it. 

After collecting the wanted items, let's go back to the place where you 
started: Cornelia Castle.


                                   ========
                                   Cornelia
                                   ========
Items: 
------
Steel Plate; Iron Shield; Crosier; Mythril Knife; Saber; Nitro Powder
------

Very simple here. Just go left or right after entering the castle to find a 
narrow path. Follow the path to the back. When you're done, just go down the
opening. You should stumble upon a wizard in a corner. Ignore him and move
on... You see two doors leading to two different rooms. Guess what? You can
enter those rooms with your new key! The right room has three treasures, 
and the left one also has three. The most important item of all: the NITRO
POWDER. You shall find out why soon... Another valuable item is definitely
the MYTHRIL KNIFE because with this, your BM could be more lethal, at last!
(not by much, though! ^_^)

With the Nitro Powder, your quest can go on...

Go on the ship once again and ride it along the coast of Cornelia, to the
northwest. After a while, you will find a port... Hmmm... interesting... Let's
dock! 

On foot, stick to the southern shoreline and walk along the beach until you
reach a path to the south. In that area, there are some mountains... but one
of those mountains has a cave inside. Find it and enter...


                                 ===========
                                 Mt. Duergar
                                 ===========
Items:
------
450 Gil; 575 Gil; 575 Gil; Tent; Helmet; Mythril Knife; Wyrmkiller;
Grand Helm; Mythril Mail; Cottage
------

Treasure galore!!! Yes, first thing you got to do here is to find the 
treasure! I would make an ASCII map for the chests, but luckily, there's no
enemies here so you can look around without any worries! (No ASCII map, too!)

Head up after entering to find a cozy room with two treasure chests: 450 GIL
and 575 GIL. Lousy crap. Bah... Let's look some more... Go all of the way 
south and find the south-most room in the mountain. The rest of the items are
all there! EIGHT of them! Enjoy the spoils! By the way, if you have a Thief in
your party, make sure you pick Wyrmkiller up... it's the best weapon in the
game for that class, besides the almighty Masamune.

After the hunting, go to the dwarf closest to the chest-filled south room. He
has a white beard, a green hat and red clothes. (minus the hat, he's Santa!)
Talk to him and he want go like this "!", the famous exclamation bubble. He
takes your Nitro Powder from you and puts it into a good use and explodes the
rock to form a canal... Guess what does this mean? Yes, you can pass through
it to broaden your horizons!!!! You rock! (Pun intended)

Get out of this place and get back to your ship...

                        CHAPTER 3 - THE EARTH CRYSTAL
                        =---------------------------=
Recommended Level: 10~12 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the ship, you can explore the new leagues of water, but there's not much 
to look. The place to go is to the west of Mt. Duergar... There lies a small
ghost town called Melmond. Luckily, it is a mere 3 steps away from its nearest
port...

                                   =======
                                   Melmond
                                   =======

Jumpin' jacks! The first thing I said about this place that is positive: the
Magic! Simply amazing arsenal... Life1, Cure3, Fire3, AND Heal2! Make
sure you have PLENTY of Gil to buy those! *drools* Enjoy this ubitiqious town
and buy some Magic, Weapons/Armor, and rest at the ever-comfy Inn. Make sure
you buy the Silver Armlets. Knight's Armor is pricey and that makes you think
that it is very... how to say... special. Well, no. It raises your DEF by 34
but decreases your EVA by 33. Not good.

I recommend you to talk to people around here, because they will explain to 
you about what's going on in this area. Some people would talk to you about
a scary place called 'Terra Cavern'. Curious...

If you're like Curious George, then let's GO!!!! To where? Fool! The Terra
Cavern, of course! Walk out of the town and walk to the southwest. You
should be able to detect a narrow strip of dry land leading to an isometric
triangle island. Naturally, that's where the mysterious Terra Cavern lies.
Go between the ranges to discover the cavern.

(Make sure you're going to the SOUTHWEST, not EAST! There's a cave called
Titan Cave and that's not the right one...)


                                 ============

------

This damn cavern is too damn long and hard! 'Tis a deadly combination... 
Despite all of that, this underground place is an excellent place to train and
a fabulous place to discover treasure. As you can see from the item list, 
there are plenty of chests to open up. However, do not be afraid to go back to
Melmond for healing. It might take you 2-3 trips to fully complete this 
scavenger. Let's pray for a moment...

For your information, most of the chests have a monster waiting for you: Gnoma.
This monster is VERY lethal, can REALLY damage your party with his single
physical attack. However, he gives out a good deal of EXP (325 for each one
in 4 surviving characters) so don't complain. :) Remember, you can go back out
to heal! 

Start off by going straight up to find a chest and around the path to find a
chest with 1975 GIL. Yeah, too much work for something so little... but it's
important to get great EXP. And yep, a Gnoma here. Good luck.

You could either go south to find two rooms with 880 GIL, POTION, 795 GIL, and
an ANTIDOTE or just ignore the Gnoma-infested traps and go to the right and 
get to B2F.

B2F: Several crossing paths and they end up with different treasures... The
best one would be the north/middle path because the south path leads to crappy
stuff and you don't want to fight Gnomas for those CRAP! Yea... Thought so...
The northern path leads to the northeast corner, which has a neat treasure:
CORAL SWORD. There are also a TENT and 330 GIL sitting nearby. If you want to
go to the southwestern corner, here's the treasure that you will uncover:
5000 GIL, LEATHER SHIELD, and 575 GIL. After all of that, go to the middle 
path and go down to B3F... the stairs are located to the right, in the
middle.

B3F: Go right and you will see a door leading to a little room with a single
chest. Walk up to it (don't worry, no Gnoma this time :-) ) and open it up
for a nice, comfy SLEEPING BED. Go back onto the original path and walk up.
You see yet another door to the left, but therein lies an encounter with a
Gnoma. The spoils: 3400 Gil. Your decision. The path to the right will lead
to another Gnoma for... (drum roll) a POTION! Blargh. Let's take the left 
path. Go around the path and head south. (on the way, you see two doors...
The second door has a chest for 1020 GIL and a Gnoma encounter so I recommend
you to ignore it...) Finally, a door at the very end. Guess what? Gnoma? 
Nope. The LAST battle in this damn dungeon... Just endure this battle and it's
all over after this battle.

_____________
BOSS: Vampire
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 156
EXP: 1200

  So easy yet so tough to keep all of those alive. Well, not that hard. This
  boss has HIGH attack power so you better heal your party up if you want all
  of them alive. The HP is ridiculously low for a boss so it should be no 
  problem for you. Fire2 and Dia2 are the killer spells against him. Physical
  attacks also work wonders. I killed him with only 3 attacks: 2 Physical 
  Attacks and a Fire2. However, he killed my WM before I could kill him. Sad.

After the battle, go ahead and open the treasure for... the STAR RUBY! Go 
ahead and try to open the remaining door... It's locked! Bah... let's leave to
heal up. I trust you know the way out and I sure don't hope you're low on 
health, either! Run, Forrest, Run! Sorry, I always wanted to say that!

Get back to Melmond to heal up your surviving members, but if you want some
reviving, you'll have to use the ship to get back to Cornelia... Yeah, no
church here! (I know, this is a frickin' madness!)

What now? Walk to the west from Melmond and, after a long stroll, you
come upon a cave in the mountains...


                                 ============
                                 Titan's Cave
                                 ============
Items: 
------
Great Axe; 450 Gil; 620 Gil; Mythril Helm
------

I like this place... Little place with some nice items, nothing big. 

Go up to the rock guy blocking your way (you would know already if you came
here before going to Terra Cavern) and he will ask you to give up the Star
Ruby you uncovered in Terra Cavern. He'll much it up and let you pass... I
know you see the stairs just north of there, but just go south to find a room
with some valuable treasure: GREAT AXE, 1070 GIL, and MYTHRIL HELM. After 
that, yes, you may go back to the stairs you saw earlier to get out of the 
cave.

You will appear at the over world again. There are only one path to follow and
please do walk on it to find yet another cave...


                                 ===========
                                 Sage's Cave
                                 ===========
                              Items: Earth Rod

Pretty simple! No items to find, nothing to do except to go to the 
northwestern corner and talk to the hermit sage. Somehow, he knows about your
venture with the Vampire... he gives you the EARTH ROD. You have to go back 
to the point where you made a rendezvous with the Vampire. Yes, the end of 
B3F of Terra Cavern. Tough luck...

If you need some healing (but I doubt it), go to Melmond for their unique 
(maybe not) Inn! When you're ready, go to Terra Cavern to explore the 
dangerous cave even further. Be prepared... 


                                 ============
                                 Terra Cavern
                                 ============
Items:
------
B4F: 3400 Gil; Staff; 1520 Gil; 5450 Gil; 1455 Gil; Tent; 1250 Gil;
     Mythril Shield
      (B4F only- B1F to B3F items are on previous Terra Cavern section)
******
Monsters:
------
Anaconda; Black Widow; Cobra; Cockatrice; Gargoyle; Ghast; Gnoma; Gobin Guard;
Hill Gigas; Lizard; Minotaur; Mummy; Ochre Jelly; Ogre; Ogre Chieftain; Ogre
Mage; Piscodemon; Sphnix; Tarantula; Troll; Warg Wolf; Werewolf; Wight; Wraith
------

**IMPORTANT NOTE: If you go to the left of the entrance in this cavern, you
might get into a famed, but infamous, hall: the Hall of Gigas. In this spot,
you will fight 3-4 (most of the time, it's 3-4 but sometimes... it might be 1
or 2) HILL GIGAS, OGRES, or OGRE CHIEFTAINS! Scary! This yields you a GREAT
deal of experience and Gil, paving your road to make it smoother! All of this
were notified to me by Natah Villegas! I was aware of this before but I wasn't
100% certain on this one. Thanks, man.***

Fight your way to the point on B3F where you fought Vampire. You can get some
of the items you didn't get on the first run through now. Up to you... Since
you're a bit more stronger, you should stay around a more longer to train up.
Again, it is a good idea to make multiple trips to this cavern for the health.

Get up to the point with the stone wall... Open up your items menu and choose
the 'Key Items' Sub-header to display the key items. Highlight the 'Earth Rod'
and... use it! The stone tablet will disappear into thin air. The stairs to
B4F appears. Gogogogogogo!

B4F: To the north, there is some chests with Gil totaling up to 11,825 and a
STAFF. However, some monsters guard it. The southern path leads to a
treasure room with 1250 GIL, TENT, and a MYTHRIL SHIELD. Your decision. Either
room has some guardians that you have to defeat to get through. Or you could
bypass them and go down to B5F, the final level in this horrid dungeon. The
exit is to the EXTREME northwest. You know what to do.  

B5F: Very easy here: Stick to the left path and go south when you can. It will
lead you to a door. A... CRYSTAL?!?!?! Wait... let's HEAL up first and save
your game (Memo). Why? It's time for a boss battle! Proceed and press X on the
crystal.

__________
BOSS: Lich
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 800
EXP: 2200

  As you can see, this boss has a LOT of HP. This boss also has level 2 Black
  Spells such as Ice2, Bolt2, Slow2, Sleep2, etc. They are very damaging, too,
  inflicting damage upwards to 150. Despite the size of the HP, you have to 
  make this battle swift. Don't heal too much, your WM have to use the Dia2
  spells, it works WONDERS on this boss, 150 easy damage points. Your 
  attackers should keep hitting on the boss, for maybe 50-60 points each 
  attack. Your BM should cast Haste because Lich as high defense against Magic
  so it's worthless to cast Magic. If you're having trouble... it could be a 
  good idea to cast NulIce or NulBolt to cease the heavy damage you receive
  from the magic. Don't stop pressing him with attacks and he should go down 
  within 5 rounds. Remember, try to maximize your attack options. If you have
  a Black Mage, cast Haste or Steel on your attackers... 

After the battle, your Earth Crystal will shimmer! 1 down, 3 to go! After a 
rather lengthy dance of your comrades (jumping jacks), go around the
crystal and stand on the light portal. It will transport you all of the way
to the over world! Stay and heal up in Melmond to prepare for your next
objective!

                         CHAPTER 4 - THE FIRE CRYSTAL
                         =--------------------------=
Recommended Level: 15~17
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get back into your ship and ride the waves to the west. More like southwest...
To make it easier, press Start and Circle while in the over world. It will
bring the map up. You should be in the middle left, below a dot (Melmond)...
Your next target is all of the way to the east... It's the SOUTHEAST-MOST
dot in the map. See it? Yeah, that's where. Go to the west (remember, the
world is round so if you go across the border to the west, you will come out
on the east line) and go south a bit to find a port directly east of the
next target (use the map to see if it's the right port). There are some ports
around that shoreline but only one will access that town. 

Walk to the west and around a thin body of water to find a town...


                                =============
                                Crescent Town
                                =============
                                 Item: Canoe

This place is REALLY cool... for your physical attackers, that is. The weapon
and armor stores is filled with Mythril items, and most of them are limited to
Warrior, Ninja, and Red Mage. If those characters arent full of Mythril, go
buy the missing Mythril items to even it up. As for Magic... not bad, but not
good, either. For your BM, Bolt3 is a definite choice. You could get Quake,
it's a very good spell... As for Reaper and Stun, they're ALRIGHT... Not
worth it tho. WM: Just get Invis2 and Shld2 for the hell of it. The other two
are worthless. If you want one more spell for your WM, then get Stona.

After the Shop-A-Thon, go to the back of the town to find a small bridge to
the east side. Follow the grassy path down and right to find a circle of 
12 sages (Knights of the Round?) Talk to all of them if you like, but the
only one you have to talk is the one right to the 'leader' of the sages.
The 'X' is the one:

    o o
   o   o
  o     o
  o     o
   o   o
    o x

He will grant you a VERY important Key Item: the CANOE! now you can travel
across shallow waters where your ship couldn't! The sage also tells you to go
to Mt. Gulg to vanquish the demon who resides there.

By the way, remember when someone said something about a 'Lukin' guy (the King
said that, I believe)? The 'x' is Mr. Lukin himself.
Let's go!

**NOTE: You don't have to follow my path, through the areas in order (Ice 
Cavern then Citadel of Trails, then etc...), so you can go ahead and do some
other dungeon and mix the order up to make this game more harder/fun. You
can go to: Mt Gulg; Ice Cavern; and Citadel of Trials.

                                  ========
                                  Mt. Gulg
                                  ========

Items:
------
B2F: 4150 Gil; Claymore; 750 Gil; 795 Gil; Mythril Helm; 1520 Gil;
     Mythril Shield; 1455 Gil; Mythril Axe; 1760 Gil; Potion; Antidote; 
     1520 Gil; 1975 Gil; Mythril Gloves; Mythril Helm; Potion; Tent

B4FB: Gold Needle; 2750 Gil; 1760 Gil; 880 Gil; Antidote; Ice Brand;
      Flame Shield; 7340 Gil; 10 Gil; 155 Gil; Cottage; 2000 Gil; Staff; 
      1250 Gil

B5F: Gold Needle; Flame Mail
******
Monsters:
------
Centipede; Fire Gigas; Fire Hydra; Fire Lizard; Hellhound; Gray Ooze; Hill 
Gigas; Horned Devil; Hyenadon; Lava Worm; Lizard; Minotaur; Ogre Chieftain; 
Ogre Mage; Pyrolisk; Pyros; Red Dragon; Scorpion; Sphinx; Wraith
------

NOTE: You should stock up your Potions to 99 and buy a couple of Cottages 
before going to the volcano!!!

Seriously, before you go to this hell, (it is literally hell, it's a volcano!)
you need to train up to LVL 14 or even 15 because the monsters there are not
grateful to you and there is a boss at the end to make it even worse. The 
monsters in the shallow waters are pretty tough but yield a lot of EXP points.
Train in the waters front of the Crescent Town until you're LVL 14 or 15, if
needed. 

Use your Canoe on the waters right next to the town and follow the river to 
the north (turn left on the 1st fork). On the next fork, go right. Then left
and continue until you see a branch going DIRECTLY west. Go on that way and
you will end up, after a LONG ride, at an area with a fiery mountain and some
trees around it. Enter that mountain. 

First thing: the lava WILL hurt you, but only 1 HP per step. The upside: NO
monster encounters here. So if you're hurting really badly, it's good to step
on the lava. The lava will decrease your health, but it won't kill you (stays
at 1 HP). So it's pretty valuable to you in certain situations. 

B1F: No items here! This is a 'fool' level. You would walk around this level,
looking for some items but there aren't any. Just go STRAIGHT to the left
to find a nice set of stairs down to B2F.

B2F: The stairs to B3F is to the left, no obstructions on the way... but...
There are a LOT of treasures waiting for you up above. The most valuable prize
is easily the Claymore, the most POWERFUL weapon yet. Everything else is just 
Gil or Mythril stuff. The Claymore is the only thing that is 'unique' or
'exclusive' in this level. Now, I recommend you to go through the second door
from the right (start). After entering that door, you will see a chest... it's
just some GIL (1520) protected by two Pyros. Not too tough but is it worth it?
Up to you. After that, go up to find yet another chest so open it up from the
SIDE (I don't know if there's an encounter from the front) for a MYHTRIL 
HELM. Continue walking north, towards that unopened chest to the left. Walk 
up to it and a Pyros will face you. Defeat it and... open the chest for the
CLAYMORE! Yay! 

The rest of the chests on this level are pure crap... If you really want to
get them, suit yourself. The chest to the right has a POTION. and the chests
to the left has Gil and Mythril Glove/Helm/Shield/Axe. You know, that crap you
already have. If you've explored the north part of the B2F, I recommend you to
go back to the Over world and use your Cottage or Sleeping Bag to get ready for
the venture downstairs. 

***Another recommendation: Collect ALL of the items in B2F for a LOT of 
experience points and go back to the over world... use the Cottage if you have 
one. If you don't then just go back to town to buy one and return to the 
mountain and save outside the entrance with your Cottage. You NEED the MP but
not HP because it will go down anyway (lava). By the time you get to B3F, you
should be at least Lv 16-17.

To get to B3F, like I said before, just go left of the entrance to B2F and 
endure the lava. 

B3FA: Like B1F, this is a REALLY simple floor. Nothing to do here expect to go
left for the entrance of B4F. Just try to watch your HP, you don't want it
to be too low when you finally fight a monster. 

B4FA: A LARGE floor! It's ALL lava here! The exit is to the southeast, so run
across the layer of lava to the exit.

B3FB: Another empty floor, but it's more like a maze this time. The stairs to
the fourth floor is in the southwestern corner. To get there, go left, down, 
down and left. 

B4FB: Finally, some chests! Wait... is that good thing? Anyway, there are 
several places with chests. The only important room: the northwestern. It 
has a FLAME SHIELD and ICE BRAND waiting for you. The Ice Brand is VERY
valuable in this dungeon, especially against the boss! There are also an
ANTIDOTE, 7340 GIL, and 880 GIL in that room. Not bad! However, you have
to fight TWO Lava Worm to get them all. Don't worry, they're not tough! :)

The other rooms has some crappy number of Gil and sucky stuff like... STAFF.
Ignore them unless you're going for the perfect Collection record. Some of
them are protected by some tough monsters so be prepared if you want to get
them. 

You want to go deeper into the cavern? Alright, the entrance to the FINAL 
floor is located at the southern-most point. Just follow the path all of 
the way south. You'll find it, don't worry.

B5F: Alas... The final level in this grueling dungeon... It's a big level,
but only a small portion is worth anything. To the east, (north, middle, and
south) there are three rooms with a chest each. The chests are 'connected' so
you have to pick which one to open and the other two will be empty. The 
treasure: a puny GOLD NEEDLE. Grab it if you want to get the 100% in the
Collections. More importantly, there is an excellent treasure to the west.
DEAD west. From the stairs, go that way and you should find a door. Make your
way through that room to the chest. However, you will have to encounter a 
Red Dragon and a Fire Lizard if you want the treasure. Defeat those bastards 
to get to the almighty FLAME MAIL! The DEF is just... AMAZING! This is all 
worth it!

Go back to the 'main'/'central' room and head to the southwestern corner. 
After a long walk on the solid ground, (or frozen lava, but whatever) you
witness a door leading to a room very similar to the one you saw in Terra
Cavern. Uh-oh... A boss battle??? Yep! CURE ALL OF YOUR CHARACTERS AND SAVE
ON YOUR MEMO FILE!

Walk up to the shiny red crystal and press on it to initiate a boss battle...

______________
BOSS: Marilith
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1200
EXP: 2475 (not bad...)

  The first thing... This boss is OBVIOUSLY a fire lover, since it is buried
  within the raging lava. What do you do? Cast Ice on him? Nope... Cast 
  NulFire, you fool! Along with your Flame Mail and Shield, you should be all
  right. After that, don't cast any Ice spells because she is not weak to 
  those spells... Just use your BM or RM to cast Haste or any status enriching
  spells to your attackers. After that, you may cast the magic to damage the
  boss. The healers should just keep watch and see if anyone need some help.
  Cure3 is always helpful! 

  You need some more tips? Shield2 is not a bad idea, considering that the 
  boss tends to attack more than cast magic. Level 3 spells are a very good
  alternative for your BM even though it may not damage Marilith a lot.

If all is well for your party, your fire crystal shines at last! There goes the
lame dance/jump again! I hate that dance! X_X Then... GO INTO THE PORTAL to
warp back to the over world!!! (Sorry, you have to travel back to a town by
yourself... HA)

                          =-----------------------=
Recommended Level: 18~20
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new? No, I'm not trying to initiate a friendly conversation with you. 
Who cares about you anyway? I mean, what is NEW? What did you get? Yeah, the
Canoe! That's right. So what do you do now? Look for some more streams to
find some new stuff!

Where to start? Let's return to the ship first (make sure you buy the items
that you didn't have a chance to buy in the Crescent Town such as magic before
leaving) and go due north. If you don't know where you parked your ark, it's
just east of here, beyond some mountains.

Ride the ship to the north and stick to the shoreline (should be to your west)
until you see a small gap for your ship to get through. Go into that little 
bay and turn to your left. A river! Cool... Just hop into the river via your
ship (you will get into the canoe) or dock at the port nearby and walk to the
river.

In the river, there are MANY branching paths, but only one path really matter
but thing can get really confusing, so please do follow me! Tip-toe to the
fork and grab the north path. Another fork awaits, but take my word and go to
the right. YET another fork: upper and lower. Take the lower one and take the
west path after that to come to a rest at a grassy area.

Have a nap in your Cottage/Tent/Sleeping Bag or whatever, and save on your
Memo File, if you wish. After that, enter the isolated cave to get into...

B5F: Ice Armor; Mythril Gloves; 7900 Gil; 5454 Gil; 180 Gil; 12,350 Gil;

Monsters:
------
Bloodbones; Cockatrice; Dark Wizard; Ghast; Ice Gigas; Mindflayer; Mummy; 
Piscodemon; Remora; Specter; White Dragon; Wight; Winter Wolf; Wraith
------

This level is a fun and a relatively short one. You could breeze through this
one if you have a BM with Fire2 or 3. Otherwise, make sure you have a well-
equipped party and you should be fine. The monsters here are actually weaker
and yields LESS EXP than the previous ones so don't worry! Even the boss ain't
that hard! However, you have to be aware for a potentially dangerous monster:
the White Dragon. Its most lethal attack, IceStorm, hits every character for
upwards of 150 damage each! It has only 200 HP so kill it quickly with your
attackers and Fire3 before it could even attack one. 

You goal is to grab the well-hidden treasure: the Levistone. What does it do?
9999 damage to the final boss? Nah... It's nothing except an item to allow 
something to FLY! Let's move on...

B1F: There are 5 items on this floor, but you can't access them right now so
let's ignore them and follow the road to the next staircase.

B2FA: Bah. There's nothing to see here except some fine-sheeted ice (did a 
Zamboni come by?) so just take either path (west, south) to get to the 
next staircase.

B3F: REALLY small one. You know what to do. If you don't then you're not
playing the game or haven't looked at the screen.

B2FB: Another small one, but this one has a room. Go around the wall to find
the door leading to this puny room. In this room you see a weird glowing blue
object flanked by two chests. Wait... did you notice the cracks on the floor?
Aye, they are indeed cracks. Do not step on them unless you really want to 
fall down to B4F. Take your time to dodge the cracks to get to the chests 
(SHIRT and FLAME SWORD). The right chest is a SHIRT, but you have to fight
3 or 4 dangerous Dark Wizards that are more than capable of taking all of
the characters away in 2 rounds. I suggest you to get the chest for the
Collection percentage later, when you're much, much more stronger. If you 
try to find a way to the middle object, you can't find one. What to do? 
Just step on a crack and let gravity pull you down!

B4F: Immediately after you fall down, you fight a squad of Specter-type 
enemies. Destroy them and move on. After exiting the room, you see a weird
type of tile that is completely unique to you. Stepping on it will damage your
characters for 1 Hp each. However, there are no random encounters in those
platforms. If you've gotten to Mt. Gulg, you would know what I'm talking about
because this stuff is VERY similar to the lava in Gulg. Back to the point, you
may go to the left to find a room guarded by a White Dragon with two chests: 
MYHTRIL GLOVES and ICE ARMOR. The Ice Armor, like the Fire Armor, is VERY 
useful in this dungeon. Go further south and you see a fork... to the left is 
a room filled with Gil, guarded by some wolves. You coiuld bypass the
encounter point by not stepping on the middle space to the left of the chests.
Like this:
  
   xxx
  o
   xxx

The 'o' is the encounter point. You should be able to figure out how to get 
all of the chests without fighting the tough wolves. The six chests total up 
to 40,784 Gil! Wow... Anyway, to the right, the stairs just leads you 
back to B1F.

B1F: Go around the room to open a chest with a POTION. Go through the other
door (you can go to the room just below for 10,000 Gil without any encounter
fight) and go to the right. Now, before you do anything... You have two 
options: take the staircase to the northeast and go back to the over world (do
this if you DESPERATELY need some healing) OR enter the room for three nice
items and a Boss Battle. Also, if you go back to the over world, you'll have to
explore the dungeon all over again to get to this point again!

Let's enter the final room! You see a crack up ahead. Of course, don't step on
it YET. Grab 9500 GIL, SLEEPING BAG, and ICE SHIELD from the chests and DROP
down the hole!!!

Just as you were going to grab the blue stone away, you get an encounter 
battle! NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

______________
BOSS: Evil Eye
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 162 (yes, 162!!!!!!!)
EXP: 3225 (For a 162-HP boss? Pretty good!)

  A very simple boss. SIMPLE. Just do 162 worth of damage and he's down. 
  Wait... there MUST be a catch in this! He can't be THAT easy! Well, there
  is a small catch... Doom. He knows THE nasty spell, Doom. It, if connected,
  will result in a fatal hit. Remember, he has only _162_ HP! Just attack 
  with everything you got and you're done!

  You wanna know how I beat the boss? Well... I commanded my two Fighters
  to Attack, my WM to cast Invis2 (just in case it makes the Doom attack miss)
  and make my BM cast Bolt3. My WM came out first and cast the seemingly
  worthless Invis2... Then my BM cast Bolt3 for 172 damage. Battle over. :) 

Grab the LEVISTONE and step on the crack to the either side. If you want to
fight Evil Eye again, please feel free to go one step south! You have to 
maneuver your way through B4F to get back to B1F and take the northeastern
stairs to return to the sweet, sweet over world!!!


                                =============
                                Crescent Town
                                =============

Make your way back to Crescent Town (dock your ship the next port south of
here) and save at the Inn if you like. Do whatever you want to do here, and
leave to the west.

Remember the river to Mt. Gulg? Its way is to the northwest. You will use the
same river, but don't go to the north or west... Just go directly south of
Crescent Town and you should see a broad-open river, eager for your canoe. 
Ride it to the east and south. Get on the solid ground just before the deep
sea. Hmmm.. what's that? A desert? Never seen a desert around this area, how
strange! Anyway, go into the desert (just be ON the desert/sand) and go to 
your Item Menu and select Levistone from the 'Key Items' sub-menu. 

Mysterious as its seem, or even impossible, the sand breaks apart like God did
to the Red Sea and spurts the AIRSHIP out! It's all yours now!

                          CHAPTER 6 - CLASS CHANGE!
                          =-----------------------=
Recommended Level: 20~24
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With your new levitating machine, you can access to the entire realm of Final
Fantasy. However, the first place you should go is the Citadel of Trials, to
the north. This place has an item, Rat's Tail, that will trigger a class 
change, THE most important advancement in this game you will ever undertake.
You may and can bypass this ordeal, but please do it unless you want a harder
challenge. That castle also has two VERY unique and RARE items: (other than 
the Rat's Tail) the Healing Staff and the Gauntlets. Those items are very 
vital to your success in the Normal Mode. Yep, you REALLY need to go there! 

First off, go to the northeast corner and look around for a town enclosed by 
mountains... that's Gaia. Some decent BM and WM magic awaits you but you don't
have to buy them right now. The equipment here are too expensive, but if you
have plenty of Gil, you could buy them (Protect Rings). You should buy 99
potions, 99 antidote and some cottages/tents if you need. 

Back on your airship, go west of Gaia, to the central part of the northern
hemisphere. Look for a broken down, shabby, fugly castle. You cannot land 
anywhere close to it because the ground is unsuitable for your airship (light
green). What to do? Just go a bit north and west to find a place with dark
green grass. Land there, since it is the closest place to the Castle. 

Walk around the bay... it's a long walk so you might want to save your game on
the memo file after every few battles. The monsters to the Citadel aren't too
tough but they can be deadly, especially that Sand Worm, which will use 
Earthquake, an automatic KO. I recommend staying close to the airship and 
fight the monsters until you're at least LVL 21 or 22 if you're not there yet.

After walking around the bay, save your game with a tent or cottage and enter
the ordeal. 

                            =====================
                            The Citadel of Trials
                            =====================
Items:
------
2F: Gauntlets*

3F: Healing Staff; Ruby Armlet; Ice Brand; Steel Gloves; Cottage; Gauntlets*;
    7340 Gil; 1455 Gil; Rat's Tail
******
Monsters:
------
Clay Golem; Dragon Zombie; Horned Devil; King Mummy; Medusa; Mindflayer; 
Mummy; Necrotaur; Nightmare; Rakshasa
------

Alright, you ready? If you're not... I'm going to tell you here, right now.
This castle hunting is OPTIONAL. Yes, you don't have to go. Decide for
yourself.

Start off by going up to the exact center of the floor to find a elder. He 
will notice that you have the crown (you got this a LONG TIME ago) and warp
off to Neverland (or whatever). What to do? Go to the northwestern corner of
the floor to find a door leading to a throne. Get on the throne to warp up to
2F.

The second floor is very deceiving and confusing. You have to travel around
the floor by the warp points. Since it's illogical to explain the warps and
their points with words, I'm going to make a map for ya. You can thank me
later. :)

3F: How fun! You just revolve around the origin of the floor, picking items
from the chests on the way! Just go up to the first chest for the famous
HEALING STAFF and equip it on your WM. However, the plate directly behind
the door is guarded by a pack of Nightmare so if you want the item, you'll
have to fight them twice... one for entering and one for leaving. Afterwards,
go left (of course!) for the RUBY ARMLET, ICE BRAND, and STEEL GLOVES. To
the south of that point has three more chests: COTTAGE, 7340 GIL, and
1455 GIL. If you haven't gotten the Gauntlets back in 2F, you can get it
right here. (By the way, did anyone notice the increase of the frequency of
the battles between this place and the over world? Maybe it's just me...)

BEFORE YOU GO UP TO THE LAST REMAINING CHEST, save your game on your memo
file, equip your attackers with the Flame Brand(s), make sure you characters
are all right, no one below 100 or 150 HP.

Now, go open the chest and you get the RAT'S TAIL... Yay! Walk to the throne
to warp back to the over world... but wait... before you go, you have to fight
the...

______________________
BOSS: Dragon Zombie(s)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 268 each
EXP: 2331 each

  Another easy one... Just use your WM's Dia spells and BM/RM's Fire spells.
  Your attackers should have the Flame Sword to damage them heavily. That's
  all. Yep, pretty easy.

Step on the chair to warp back to 1F and pave your way to the over world!


                              ================
                              The Dragon Caves
                              ================
         Items: Tent; Gold Needle; 575 Gil; 10 Gil; 500 Gil; Cottage;
     1455 Gil; 2750 Gil; 2000 Gil; 9500 Gil; 160 Gil; 2750 Gil; 1520 Gil

Save with your Tent or Cottage if you like and fight your way back to the
airship. You really don't have to heal in any Inn/Church but you can if you
want. To make the Rat's Tail useful, go to the southwest of the Citadel to
find a string of islands with some holes in them. I recommend you start off
with the west-most island to get some items and cash. The items you can get
are listed above, and you don't have to fight anything to get them because
there are no random encounters in those Dragon Caves. Take your time getting
them all.

When you've gotten all of the items in the caves by jumping from one cave to
another via the airship, enter the right cave on the island with two caves. 
After a LONG shrinking hallway, you finally find a stairs leading to a sword-
infested hall. At the end of the room is... the incomparable BAHAMUT!!!!

He sees the Rat's Tail and recognizes your efforts to get it. He immediately
transform all of your characters to the ultimate form. We kick ass now...

The 'evolutions':
-----------------
   Warrior -> Knight
     Thief -> Ninja
      Monk -> Master
  Red Mage -> Red Wizard
White Mage -> White Wizard
Black Mage -> Black Wizard

You should go ahead and buy Warp2 for your WM, Life1 for your RW, Cure spells
for youe Knight, and Black spells for your Ninja. (Thanks to Red Scarlet for 
the help!)

                       ===============================
                       Gaia & The Search for the Fairy
                       ===============================

Gaia: Japanese for 'Earth'. Thought you'd like to know... :) Go to the town
of Gaia to the northeast, surrounded by mountains. From the over world, the town
looks gray, probably symbolizing the depressing earth background. 

Once in this town, you, of course, would think fast and dash for the magic 
stores. Well, you could... but I won't advise you on it. I'd rather you to 
hold back for now because of the steep prices and the chances are: you won't
use it as much any time soon. But if you have a butt-load of cash, just go 
ahead and shop like there's no tomorrow.

The point of this town is the valuable information about the Faeries's
unique ability. If you talk to the man next to the magic shops to the left, 
he will tell you about an substance called Oxyale (sounds like some kind of
a liquor... but whatever) and only Faeries can collect it. Interesting... 

You could search for hours and hours to find more information about the 
missing Faeries, but you could just come here and find out about them... :)
Just go to your Airship and ride the casbah to the northwest piece of land.
However, the northwest continent is just right of the town of Gaia so it's
not a long ride from the town if you went the right way! Hah. The lone desert
on the land has a smaller piece of sand to the north, next to a forest. Land 
just next to that desert, to the west, right next to the shore. Walk to that 
'separated' desert and enter the caravan, which is in the middle of the 
desert. 

In the little gypsy town, enter the sole store and open up the shop menu. Aha.
The BOTTLED FAERIE. Grab it for the low, low, looooooow price of.... 50,000
Gil! If you don't have the money, then sell some of your equipment! HAHAHA!
Well, that's what I did! Heh.

After buying the worthless piece of junk, return to your Airship and head for
Gaia yet again. By now, you should know what you should do... to locate the 
spring and use the Faerie to retrieve the Oxyale. The spring is to the 
northeast, but you have to trek to the west and circle the path to the east
for the spring. Go to your Key Items Menu and release your poor, trapped 
Faerie. She will thank you and get the OXYALE for you! (This reminds me of...
the original Legend of Zelda... Hmmm...)

The function of the town of Gaia is done for now. Its has served its purpose.
Good-bye. Nah, I'm just kidding, you'll be back. Leave to the same location
where you got the Bottled Faerie. This time, however, you should land just
below the large desert. Find a spot just north or south (doesn't matter)
of the river and land there. 

You have two options now. You could travel by foot to the right to the town
of Onlak for some shopping, or you could stop by the Waterfall Cavern for
a quick level up and get an essential item. I recommend you to go to the
town first to heal up or get some new stuff. I'm going to the Cavern first
because I will return to Onlak later.


                              ================
                              Waterfall Cavern
                              ================
Items:
------
Spellbinder; Ribbon; 13,450 Gil; 6,400 Gil; 5,000 Gil; Defender; Warp Cube
******
Monsters:
------
Clay Golem; Cockatrice; Green Dragon; King Mummy; Mummy; Nightmare; Pyrolisk
------

To get to this dark underground abode, use your canoe to go north, against
the current of the river that lies a few steps left of the town of Onlak.
At the end of this stream, there is a waterfall pouring. Go into the 
waterfall to discover this palace. (Well, not a palace... but anyway)

This place is REALLY oh-so-simple. You start off in the bottom right corner
and everything you need/want is in the bottom left corner so let's go there!
Go left all of the way until you reach a fork with two paths: up and down. 
Take the bottom path and you should reach the hidden room with all of the
items: SPELLBINDER, RIBBON(!!!), 13,450 GIL, 6,400 GIL, 5,000 GIL, and the
DEFENDER. You might have noticed a robot walking around in the room...
He's actually friendly, so don't be afraid. Talk to him and he will you 
the WARP CUBE. Right now, it's not important, but it will be pretty soon.

Let's backtrack to the stairs and canoe back to the land and walk east to
Onlak.


                                    =====
                                    Onlak
                                    =====

Heal up and buy whatever you want. This place has the great Saber and Heal3
magic so buy them for 45,000 Gil apiece. Unfortunately, there is no 
equipment store so you'll have to bear with your current format. Luckily, the
following dungeon has plenty of newer equipment and they will replace most of
your equipment... Saves ya money, I guess. :) Save at the Inn if you like.

Go across the tiny stream cutting the town in half and follow the path right.
At the end, there is a mermaid (or at least she looks like one, I guess) 
blocking your way to a submarine. Talk to her and she will state: "Warriors
with Oxyale..." and disappear into thin air... A ghost?! Hmmm...

Go into the sub (turns out that it's actually a barrel!) and it will transport
you to the ocean bottom, where you will reach the 'Sunken Shrine', 3F.


                                =============
                                Sunken Shrine
                                =============
Items:
------
2F: Light Axe; 5450 Gil; 385 Gil; Giant's Glove; 7690 Gil; 8135 Gil; 2750 Gil;
    Ribbon; 9900 Gil; 7340 Gil
3F: 2000 Gil; 9900 Gil; 450 Gil (3FB); 100 Gil (3FB)
4F: 20 Gil; Diamond Armor; Light Axe; Mage's Staff; 12,350 Gil
5F: Diamond Armlet; 9000 Gil; 1760 Gil; 4150 Gil; 2750 Gil; 10,000 Gil; 
    10 Gil; Antidote; Diamond Shield; 5000 Gil; Diamond Gloves; Diamond Helm; 
    Rosetta Stone
******
Monsters:
------
Aquos; Cockatrice; Deepeyes; Ghost; King Mummy; Mummy; Pyrolisk; Sahagin 
Chief; Sahagin Prince; Sea Scorpion; Sea Snake; Sea Troll; Shark; Water Naga;
White Shark
------

Before we start, I want to tell you have TWO objectives here. The first one is
go up and search for the Rosetta Stone. The second one is to go down and 
eliminate the third Fiend, Kraken. You have to do both but, obviously, you 
should go up because you gather EXP on the way that might benefit on the boss
fight. To begin, there are two stairs on the opening floor (3F, not 1F). The
right set goes up, to the Rosetta Stone. The left one, as you figured, goes 
down, toward the depths of the dungeon to Kraken. I'm going to start going up.

3F: Walk up, through the Roman pillars (Atlantis?) and go right when you see
two big black slabs to reach a room with 2000 GIL inside. If you want another
9900 GIL, go left from the 2000 Gil room and walk past the central path to get
to the other side. Walk up to find yet another door. Yep, the 9900 Gil is in 
there. Now, you know what to do... pick one of the stairs. The right one goes
up, to the Rosetta Stone. The left one goes down, to Kraken. Your choice.

4F: Items are aplenty here. Since the enemies aren't that hard, just take your
time collecting the items. The most important item: the DIAMOND ARMOR, which
is hidden in the chest in the top room. Trek to the north and enter the room
for this item. 20 GIL is in the middle room, and to the bottom left: LIGHT
AXE. In the rooms left of the stairs to 5F, MAGE'S STAFF and 12,350 Gil lies 
all alone in their rooms. The stairs is to the extreme bottom right.

5F: My favorite floor of all! NO ENEMIES HERE!!! Yep, you heard (read) me 
right! All you have to do is gather every treasure and grab the Rosetta Stone!
There are many treasures to uncover and they are scattered throughout the
rooms in this shrine. There are THIRTEEN treasures, including the Rosetta 
Stone in this floor so count them so you don't miss anything! You could talk
to the Mermaids if you like, but they are full of blabber. 

If you're wondering how to get to the room with the Rosetta Stone, just go
to the northwestern path and it will lead you there. This room is spherical,
like the Earth so if you go left, you will come out in the right side... 
neat, huh?

If you have the magic spell Warp2, you can use it here to teleport back to
Onlak for a quick heal. If you don't, then I guess you have to go back the 
hard way. :) Good luck. Remember to take the left stairs when you come back
to go down to Kraken.

2F: This floor has some treasures but you cannot access them right now. The
only thing you can do is to go up to a new set of stairs, leading to 3FC.

3FC: Hah. What do you think? Go on to 4FA.

4FA: There is a room with nothing inside so ignore it and go around it to
locate the stairs to 3FB.

3FB: Open the door and enter the room to find two chests (450 GIL and 100 
GIL). After finding how pathetic the cash is in here, take the other door to
the stairs.

2F: Finally! The OTHER side of 2F, the side with the treasures! Let's go south
to a room with 8135 GIL and 7690 GIL. Leave the room and go left to find 
one more room with those treasures: 5450 GIL, 385 GIL, and the ever powerful
GIANT'S GLOVE! This item, when used in battle, will heighten your attack power!!
Go north to find a lone treasure: LIGHT AXE (another one, blah). RIBBON 
(protects you from status ailments so it is better than you think, depsite its
+1 DEF advantage), 9900 GIL, 7340 GIL, and 2750 GIL are all in the room 
right of the Light Axe. After collecting them all, go to the northwest corner 
for the final stairs.

1F: Bah... No treasures here but you have to walk for a while to get to the
end... The end of this floor has the third crystal, the blue one... Hmmm...
Go left once you enter this floor. Go up and continue until you see a left.
Of course, take that left and proceed until you see a door. Yep. The final 
door, leading to the boss. Nah, I'm kidding! :D This room is a winding one, 
just there to make this dungeon a bit longer. (damn you, Squaresoft!)
Find the other door and go on to the final room. (I'm serious this time...)

As you should have already knew, save on your memo file and heal up. This
boss is fairly tough, but not too tough that you can't handle it. Go up to
the ball and tap X... (been a long time since our last boss, sniff)

____________
BOSS: Kraken
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1600
EXP: 4245

  This battle is a VERY anti-climax one. While the boss is gigantic, the
  size of the HP is off the charts, and the strength of this boss is over-
  whelming, this one is simple to master. This boss has no magic other than
  Bolt2 to damage you so he depends on his brute strength to kill you. Now,
  to take away the 1600 HP he has, you use your attackers. With their pure 
  strength, they will damage him for about... 15 points. Yes, 15! It does make
  it even tougher, doesn't it? Well, no. If you've gotten the GIANT'S GLOVE
  earlier, you can master this battle without any trouble. The Giant's Glove
  heightens your attack power and it seems to 'remove' the defense of 
  Kraken's. Use this glove as an item to boost your fighter (he must be 
  choosing it). After that, boost your fighters even more with your BM/RM's 
  Haste. With those, your fighters can attack for upwards for 450 damage! Your
  WM/WW should cast physical barriers (Shld2 and Invis2). I could talk all day
  about this battle  but I'll sum it up with a few steps:

  (My team: Neo-Knight; Fox-Knight; Slut69-WW; Jesus-BW)
  Round 1:
    Neo: Giant's Glove
    Fox: Gauntlets for 100 Damage
    Slut69: Invis2
    Jesus: Haste on Neo
  Round 2:
    Neo: Attack (8x) for 400 Damage
    Fox: Giant's Glove
    Slut69: Shld2
    Jesus: Haste on Fox
  Round 3:
    Neo: Attack (8x) for 400 Damage
    Fox: Attack (8x) for 400 Damage
    Slut69: Gauntlets for 100 Damage
    Jesus: Bolt3 for 150 Damage
  Round 4:
    Kraken has about 50-150 damage left so finish him off!

  See? Extremely easy. No healing needed! 

After the enjoyable battle, you get to dance again! Step on the portal to warp
back to the over world, just outside Onlak. Enter the town to heal up or 
whatever.

                        CHAPTER 8 - THE WIND CRYSTAL
                        =--------------------------=
Recommended Level: 25~28
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With three of the Fiends out of the way, let's charge the fortress of the 
fourth Fiend. Without a doubt, this Fiend has a large following to help him
survive any opposers. Therefore, you have to encounter through some large
obstacles... to be specific: TWO dungeons. Well, unless you're dyslexic, (why
are you reading this if you are, anyway?) you DID read about the two dungeons.
To add injury to insult, you have to go through the dungeons consecutively
without any 'breaks' for healing. All I have to say: good luck.

First, go to Melmond to meet a rather strange person, Dr. Unne. You probably
don't remember where Melmond so bring your World Map up (Circle + Start) and
move the pointer down to 'Melmond' and press X. Look at the World Map... you
should be shown the location of Melmond. It is just across the ocean from 
Onlak, in the middle of the world. 


                                   =======
                                   Melmond
                                   =======

Upon the arrival, ignore everything you see in the beginning and go up and
walk over the bridge to the upper part of Melmond. Immediately turn right and
stick to the right side. You should eventually see a blond man standing 
patiently on the graveyard. Go talk to him and he will exclaim about your
Rosetta Stone, which you just got from the Sunken Cavern. (I did tell you to
get it, didn't I?) He explains that this stone deciphers the legendary 
Lufenian language (Latin, perhaps?) The wacky doctor Unne teaches you the
magical Lufenian language. Congrats, you're now fluent for that language!

Leave the town and hop into your Airship. Your next location: Lufenia, the 
birthplace of the language you just learned. Go northwest or northeast, to
the northeastern continent, where Gaia lies. To the west of Gaia, there is a
fairly large desert that resembles the Sahara Desert. Wait, don't go there 
yet, kiddo. Go southeast from that desert and follow that forest-y peninsula.
At the extreme end of that jutting piece of land, you finally find the town
of Lufenia. Oddly, you cannot land anywhere near it because of the lack of
de-forestation. The nearest landing spot for your lovable airship: to the
north, just next to the pond/lake. The spot is only one unit in length and
width so look around carefully for it (northeastern side of the pond). 

Yes, you have to walk all of the way to Lufenia. Good training, no? No? Too
bad. 


                                   =======
                                   Lufenia
                                   =======

There's virtually nothing to do here, yet this is a valuable town for your
game progress. First, ignore the fruitcakes and go to the northeastern corner.
You will see a gap leading to nowhere. Trust me on this and walk directly 
east. You won't be placed in the over world... Instead, you will see a well-
hidden Magic store. They have the BEST spells in the game, one for your WW and
another for your horny BW (I mean the hat!). Flare will make the enemies 
scream for their mommies and Life2 will revive your fallen warriors back to
FULL health! They rule...

Your next objective (it was your primary one anyway): To locate the man with
the Bell. The man standing on the bottom corner of the eastern hemisphere, 
undoubtedly waiting for you. Talk to the blonde and he will give you the BELL.

Leave this just-got-worthless town (now this town has LITERALLY nothing!) for
your airship again. (Yeah... another long walk back! Round trip fare!)

Once back at your Airship, heal up (nearest town is Gaia) and re-stock your
items with 99 Potions and some Cottages. Time for the 4th Fiend!

Let's go west of Lufenia and Gaia, to the desert. Fly over the desert and
circle around it until you see a tower speared into the desert's heart. That's
your next journey, the Tower of Mirage. Memorize its location so you won't
get lost and go south and final landing spot just below the desert. Walk up
and battle the monsters until you reach the Tower...


                               ===============
                               Tower of Mirage
                               ===============
Items:
------
1F: Vorpal Sword; 18,010 Gil, Tent; Aegis Shield; 2750 Gil; 3400 Gil; 800 Gil;
    Healing Helm
2F: Dragon Mail; 10,00 Gil; Sunblade; 7600 Gil; Cottage; 8135 Gil; 7900 Gil; 
    Thor's Hammer; 12,350 Gil; 13,000 Gil
******
Monsters:
------
Black Knight; Blue Dragon; Chimera; Cockatrice; Guardian; Hellhound; King
Mummy; Medusa; Mummy; Nightmare; Pyrolisk; Sabretooth; Vampire; Weretiger;
Wyrm; Wyvern
------

Before we start, you have to know the following: You can use Warp2 to return
to the over world after the chest-collecting if you feel that you cannot
endure 5 more floors that exist in the next dungeon. But if your party are
well-equipped and strong enough, you can collect all of the items and beat
the Fiend all in one run. However, don't be afraid to return for some healing
if you need since this Tower is fairly short with 3 straightforward floors. 
You can literally blow through this place if you don't pay attention to the
items.

Now, let's start. 

1F: The stairs to 2F is RIGHT NEXT to the entrance! Just go through the door
that you can see right now. Go left a bit and you will see another door. Once
you enter through that door, you can see the stairs to 2F. However, if you 
want the delicious (and worthy) items on this floor, you'll have to search
a bit longer. They are located at the middle of the room but you have to
circle the room to discover the tombs. The treasures: TENT, HEALING HELM 
(works the same way at the Healing Staff if you use it as an item), 800 GIL,
2400 GIL, 18,010 GIL, VORPAL SWORD, AEGIS SHEILD, and 2,750 GIL. Then return
to the bottom part for the stairs to 2F.

2F: Another simple one, but you have to walk a great distance to get to the
spoils and the exit. Just follow the path that comes before you until you
finally reach an opening that leads you deeper into the room (a LONG walk).
If you want the prizes, go right to another opening and go down for a door
leading to the central room, which has: 8135 GIL, 7900 GIL, THOR'S HAMMER,
12,350 GIL, 13,000 GIL, COTTAGE, 7,600 GIL, SUNBLADE, 10,000 GIL, and
the DRAGON MAIL. Exit the room and head up again. Don't go through any 
openings! If you paid attention on your walk around this floor, you should've
saw a set of stairs with a monster walking around it. Yep, go up those stairs
(north part). 

3F: The last floor in this Tower... Another straightforward one, but this 
time, it's much, MUCH easier. Go down to find a door leading to a lone room...
Before you enter those doors, save on your memo and heal up your party (not to
the max, not that tough of a battle). Proceed to the doors and a Blue Dragon
will confront you for the sake of his job (guardian). This guy has a 
feverishly high attack power, but he has only 454 HP so you could take him 
down if you have two powerful physical attackers. Just cast Haste on one of
your attackers and pick him apart. 

After the battle, proceed to the flashing stone flanked by 4 stone slabs. Once
you step on it, you will be warped up to the Flying Fortress! If you didn't 
get warped, then it is very evident that you forgot to get the WARP CUBE 
earlier. Refer to the Waterfall Cavern in Chapter VIII for this item. 


                               ===============
                               Flying Fortress
                               ===============
Items:
------
1F: Potion; 9,900 Gil; 4150 Gil; 7900 Gil; Venom Blade; 6720 Gil; 
    Healing Helm; Protect Ring; 180 Gil; 5000 Gil
2F: Diamond Gloves; Mythril Helm; Cottage; 13,000 Gil; 880 Gil; Adamantine; 
    Ribbon; Diamond Shield; White Robe; Black Robe
3F: 9,000 Gil; Potion; Protect Ring; 5,450 Gil; Gold Needle; 6,400 Gil; 
    9,500 Gil; Shirt; Protect Cloak; 8,135 Gil; Gold Needle; 4,150 Gil; 
    Sasuke; 3,400 Gil
******
Monsters:
------
Aeros; Black Knight; Chimera; Clay Golem; Dark Flan; Dark Warrior; Earth 
Medusa; Evil Eye; Fire Hydra; Manticore; Medusa; Mindflayer; Neochu; 
Nightmare; Rakshasa; Soldier; Spirit Naga; Stone Golem; Vampire Lord
------

If you dash for the stairs on every floor without grabbing any treasures, you
could end up in the top floor, facing Tiamat without any scratches on your 
party. Of course, you could differ. The items here are extraordinary and you,
without a doubt, will benefit from it. Items such as Diamond Shield, 
Adamanite, and Protect Ring will make you salivate when you discover their 
true meanings. (Especially Adamanite, a MUST get!) The monsters here can be 
annoying with their status-changing spells (Death, etc.) so I recommend you 
to save on your Memo file every battles or so (cheap but it works... heh). 

Remember, save often and beware of the dangerous monsters here!

1F: Plenty of items here... As you go out of the room you got in via the Warp
Cube, you see that you have 4 paths to go... Where to go? Well, let me 
summarize all that with a nice ASCII art!

                                 Stairs to 2F

                                 Venom Blade

Venom Blade is fairly effective, since it can kill this dungeon's boss in one
hit. 

Easy as that, huh? Go wherever you wish. 


2F: An easy level to paint out.

                                 Stairs to 1F

                                 Stairs to 3F


3F: The layout is more chunked than 1F's but it has the basic directions so
I can make a ASCII map of it. Please note that the directions to the treasure
are GENERALLY speaking, not the direct arrow. The upper room is a bit to the
left but its more to the north than it is to the left so you should know what
I mean.

                                    none

I would say go to the north AND east rooms first (order doesn't matter) and
go to the west room last because the stairs is right next to the room. Make
sure you get Sasuke if you have a Ninja in your party, it's his best weapon
next to the Masamune (Masaume again... blargh). Protect Cloaks are the best
shields for the mages.


4F: Just go right or left twice and go south twice to find the entrance to 5F.
    Yawn.

5F: Save your game now, and heal up all of the way! Walk up the hall and click
    on the Crystal for.... (drum roll) a BOSS BATTLE!!!

____________
BOSS: Tiamat
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 2000
EXP: 5496

  A menacing boss and she look tough to slay... and she is! Especially with
  2000 HP... She throws a variety of attacks at you such as physical claw
  attacks, Thunderbolt, Toxin (VERY lethal!), and some other minor ones. Make
  sure your WW keeps your party's HP at the VERY HIGH levels! Toxin can throw
  your party off if you're not careful enough. As usual, your Knights/Ninjas
  should use the Giant's Glove and have your BW/RW cast Haste on them. With
  those, your Knights can attack for about 500 Damage! Pretty nice! Your WW
  and BW can barely scratch the boss so let them concentrate on the healing
  and the status boosters. Your WW could cast NulBolt to prevent the high
  damage from the Thunderbolt spell. After that, you could heal or cast Shld2
  to shut down the physical damage all of the way. Again, like Kraken, you 
  have to reply on your physical attackers to win this semi-tough battle.

  One more tip: Break can wipe her out in a single fierce blow. (Thanks, Red
  Scarlet.)

After the battle... just go on the warp!

                       CHAPTER 9 - BACK FROM THE FUTURE
                       =------------------------------=
Recommended Level: 35+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Before we all start raiding the final dungeon and assassinate the ultimate 
boss, make sure your party are at least level 35. You could do this by 
fighting enemies with fairly high EXP (Rivers) or fighting the Evil Eye in
the Ice Cavern over and over (one hit kill from your Knight or Master). If
you're on a roll, just go on to level 40 because you will need every level up!

The dungeon is a grueling test for your ENDURANCE... not your power! Well, you
need power, but you need the endurance more. So buy 99 Potions, 99 whatever,
and get all of the magic you need (Flare and Life2... you must have those 
magic!) Another must-have item: EXCALIBUR! If you've gotten the Adamantite 
from the previous dungeon, you can get this item. Go to the Dwarf Cave and 
enter the northern room to talk to Smithy. He will forge the sword for free!
It's all yours!

All done? Let's go back to the beginning of the time! Toward the timeless town
of Corneria! Save and heal at the Inn and go to the Temple of the Fiends (to
the north, where you fought the first boss, Garland.)

The Temple is fairly long and there's a good reason behind it. You have to go
up to 3F first to unlock a way down to the basements, where the true battles
occur. The Four Fiends are back, hence the name of this temple. Yes, Lich,
Marilith, Kraken and Tiamat are all here. 

Before we start, you should know about a neat survival technique: (you should
have known about this but I'm saying this just in case) use your Healing Staff
and Helm to heal your party EVERY battle. Use your Wizards for healing. Never,
never use magic unless it is used for wiping out a LARGE (6+) party of enemies
OR the bosses. Your Knights and Monks can handle them all with some decent 
healing. Got that? Good. 

The enemies here are pretty tough, but nothing that you can't handle. They are
actually pretty easy for you if your levels are high enough (35+). Some 
enemies to watch out: Mindflayer and Vampires in B4F and White Dragons in 
1F-3F. That's about it. Onward!

Go up to the crystal in the central room and touch it...

  1F
  --
Four staircases here. Two inaccessible right now. One leads to the dead end.
One remains. The southeastern corner. Yep, that stairs goes up to 2F. Let's 
go!

  2F
  --
Go to the east and a sparkling brand new stairs leads you to 3F.

  3F
  --
Go down until you clear the second room and head east. Follow the pillars to
the entrance to the central room, where a Death Eye will confront you. Destroy
it with Fire magic and physical attacks. Hmm.... You see your first chests in
this dungeons! Must be tasty! Let's see what's inside! Ughhh... 45,000 GIL and
65,000 GIL? We don't need that now! We need some powerful swords that split 
the bosses in half! Meh.

Back to the point, stand on the tile in front of the stone slab in the middle
of the room. Play the LUTE that you got AGES ago. A ladder appears out of
nowhere!

  2F
  --
Get out of the room you're in and head west, then north. Go to the north-
western corner to find the stairs down to 1F.

  1F
  --
Just hop from the northeastern corner to the northwestern corner for the 
stairs down.

  B1F - Earth
  ---   -----
Sigh... NOW there's a TOUGH floor! Walk around the horn (up, right, and
down, to the other side of the floor) to locate the highly protected stairs.
Why protected? Let's SAVE and HEAL before you find out! ^_^ 

You will fight the first Fiend, Lich, here. Just pummel him with your Knights
and Monks while your Wizards use Healing Helm/Staff (don't want to waste 
magic on him). He has only 1000 HP so your Fighters should be able to take
him down within 2 rounds. However, he casts FLARE to your party so be prepared
to withstand the damage! Good luck.

  B2F - Fire
  ---   ----
Yep, another floor guarded by a Fiend. But before that, you should pick up 
some of the treasures that reside on this floor. To the south of the entrance
from B1F, there's a PROTECT RING. To the right of the Protect Ring, therein
lies a PROTECT CLOAK. Further east is a chest with 26,000 GIL. Not 
recommended. To the extreme south (go to the western end for the path down)
is a room with SASUKE. You could just skip them all and head to the stairs,
just to the right of the stairs you came in, down to B3F without any hassle.

Of course, you have to defeat the second Fiend before moving on... Marilith!
Bah. Too easy. Just cast NulFire and kick her ass with Haste powered-up 
Knights/Monks. 1400 HP is nothing to you right now.

  B3F - Water
  ---   -----
Oh boy, oh boy. Nothing in this level but you have to go through countless
rooms to get to the next set of stairs. Just maneuver through the rooms,
heading to the southeastern corner, where the stairs awaits. 

The next Fiend? Kraken. Surprisingly, he isn't weak to Bolt. He has buffed
his muscles and is prepared to smash your party to pieces. Fear not. Cast
Shld2 to offset this. Your RM and BM should cast Haste to power your
attackers up to finish him off. His HP is another 400 above the previous one:
1800.

  B4F - Wind
  ---   ----
This floor has one of the game's BEST weapons, but it's long and far away...
You'll have to fight through a LOT of battles to get it. The weapon: MASAMUNE!
IMO, I think it's worth it, since ANY character can use it!!!!! Really! 
To get it, go south to the next block room, and go east. Continue going east
until you see a narrow path, still heading east. Take that path and it will
lead you to the room with the Masamune inside. Do what you please with it. 

Whether if you've collected the weapon or not, go to the room right of the
one that you entered (you entered the northwestern corner so go to the north-
eastern corner). However, the only way to that room is from the northwestern
corner so you have to go there first in order to get to the stairs.

Yet another boss... Bah. This is REALLY getting old! Tiamat is tougher this 
time so you should cast your toughest magic for your party's sake. He wields
a variety of magic and attacks so you have to be prepared to take the damage.
You could always cast NulAll to lessen the damage. Like always, haste your
attackers to maximize the inflicted damage. You could waste a turn to cast
Saber (Giant's Gloves) if you think you can take a round's worth of damage.
If you have Masamune, just equip it on your Knight and use Giant's Glove and
cast Haste on him. He should do 1000+ damage easily. 

  B5F
  ---
HEAL TO THE MAX AND SAVE!!!!!!!!!! No battles here except for the FINAL boss!
Dodge the pillars and head to the heart of the floor. Alas... you meet the
young Garland! He already knew that you killed him 2 thousand years in the
future (he was rather easy, bah) but the Four Fiends revived him back...
Bah, let's FIGHT!!!

___________
BOSS: Chaos
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 4000 (!!!)

  He has a lifetime's worth of HP AND he casts Cure4, which heals himself
  ALL OF THE WAY to the MAX, OFTEN! (Did all of that caps hurt you? too bad.)
  He has, like most of the bosses, has a high defense against magic so don't
  waste your Flare and Holy on him. Your WM should cast NulAll while your BM
  or RM casts Haste and Steel to your party. Your attackers MUST use the 
  Giant's Glove or you're going to have a tough time! 

  In other words, this is just another regular boss battle... it's just a
  prolonged one. Here's my battle report:

          Round 1         Round 2         Round 3         Round 4
          -------         -------         -------         -------
KN-Neo    Attack          Giant's Glove   Attack          Attack
KN-Fox    Giant's Glove   Attack          Attack          Attack
WW-Slut69 NulAll (Neo)    Shld2           Life 2 (Jesus)  NulAll (Jesus)
BW-Jesus  Haste (Neo)     Haste (Fox)     Dead            Steel
Chaos     Attack          Blaze           Tsunami         Tornado

          Round 5
          -------
KN-Neo    Attack          
KN-Fox    Attack (KILL!!!)
WW-Slut69 Cure4 (69)
BW-Jesus  Flare
Chaos     Attack

  That's about it. Luckily for me, Chaos never cast the ever-annoying Cure4
  so I was able to kill him quickly. 

When you've defeated him, congrats! And enjoy the ending! The ending is just a
crappy text-based one. But you had fun playing this game, right? Heh... thanks
for using my Final Fantasy I Walkthrough!!! Remember to save at the end!

                             In a distant land...
         The peace long enjoyed by the people came to a crashing end.
      The emperor of Palamecia summoned fiends from another dimension...
           And the empire launched its campaign for world conquest.

           In response, a rebel force arose in the kingdom of Fynn.

    In the ensuing clash between rebel and empire, Castle Fynn was taken.
       The rebels were forced to retreat to the remote town of Altair.

         Amidst the chaos, four youths also fled the occupied Fynn. 
          They were childhood friends, now orphaned and homeless...

         And they suddenly found themselves running for their lives.

                         IV. FINAL FANTASY II BASICS
                        -----------------------------
==============================================================================

Where to start, what to say? This game, at the first glance, is rather simple
but behind the flowers are the horrors of leveling up. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  CONTROLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  X--------------------Select/confirm
  Circle---------------Cancel/dash (hold)
  Square---------------Magic Menu
  Triangle-------------Main Menu
  Start----------------Main Menu
  L1-------------------Items Menu
  L2-------------------Equipment Menu
  R1-------------------Status Menu
  R2-------------------Formation Menu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 ATTRIBUTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no level-up system, it is replaced with this odd-ball system: you are
rewarded when you frequently use that stat. Ugh. Here is the chart to make it
more easier to understand:

Here's how you get the bonuses: 
(over MANY BATTLES means that it is counted together from every battle)

           HP ---> Severe loss of HP in ONE BATTLE
           MP ---> Frequent use of MP in ONE BATTLE
     Strength ---> Attacking, over MANY BATTLES
    Endurance ---> Losing HP, over ONE BATTLE
       Spirit ---> Using White Magic, over MANY BATTLES
 Intelligence ---> Using Black Magic, over MANY BATTLES
     Accuracy ---> Use of Weapons, over MANY BATTLES
      Evasion ---> Physical Attacks are aimed at you, over MANY BATTLES
      Agility ---> Physical Attacks are aimed at you, over MANY BATTLES
Magic Defense ---> Magic Spells are aimed at you, over MANY BATTLES

 Weapon Level ---> Levels up after 100 uses
  Magic Level ---> Levels up after 100 'points' of usage

You also can get some losses in those attributes if you're lucky.

-As you gain STR, you might decrease INT.
-As you gain INT, you might decrease END.
-As you gain SPR, you might decrease STR.

As for the Magic Levels, its power increases as its level goes up. The maximum
is 16. Same thing goes to the Weapon Levels.

I know this is a weak explanation but this has a reason. The explanations is
below...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          BATTLE SYSTEM/LEVELING UP
          (This includes the dirty way of doing this so read this!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As expected from a NES game, this one is turn-based in the form of the party.
The ENTIRE party selects its commands for the turn and you watch as both sides
duke it out for a turn each. So simple, you can't NOT understand it. However,
the question is the absense of the most important number in most RPGs: the
levels of your characters. Instead, your HP, MP, Strength, Intelligence, and
everything else is determined by your frequency for the need of them. The
developers intended the system to be created so that whenever you get to a
tougher place, the stats goes up accordingly. So when you fight a huge
behemoth and your party is amusingly weak and barely survives it, you are
rewarded physically so the next time you face this monster, it is easier. 
Well, it was their INTENTIONS. Sadly, it does not show.

Why won't it show? Well, for one, it is VERY easily abused, which I will
explain to you further on. Another reason is that it is not effective. You're
in the middle of a dungeon and you're battling to survive it until the end,
you don't have the chance to heal up except if you can afford to go back. Now,
you are supposed to get rewarded HERE! Your HP is in peril and MP is almost
dried up! You get rewarded by raising the MAXIMUM number of the HP/MP, not by
a curative method. So you got 100 HP and you get 50 HP bonus... You die
trying to get out. Where's the 50 HP now?

That brings us to the reason why we abuse the concept. It is simply too 
difficult to do it in the 'honest' method. We just get the bonuses BEFORE we
are supposed to get it, that's all. I sound like a ex-con trying to prove why
I did it. But you will do the same, so don't call me anything yet. Getting the
bonuses early just paves the way to an easy road. The example I gave you in
the second paragraph should be enough for you to comphrend why we do it.

The only statuses that can be manipulated are: HP, MP, Weapon level and Magic
Level, the visual effects. The other statueses can, theorically, be 
manipulated but I won't call that because you actualy earned it but whatever.

How do you do it? Simple. As for the HP, you just hack at yourself until you
have under 50% of the original HP (the number of HP when you entered that
battle). If you do it successfully (deaths won't work, sorry), you have a
good chance, not definite, of getting the HP bonus.

The MP bonus, like every stat bonus, is only attained in the battles despite 
its ability to be used outside the battles. You have to use it quite 
frequently in a battle to get the bonus. Again, like the HP bonus, the more
MP you use in a battle, the better the chance of getting it.

The Weapon Level is the dirtiest one of all. It is used to make your 
proficiency, the ability to use the given weapon well, stronger. It is 
determined by the number of your uses of that weapon. Every 100 hacks with
the weapon, you gain a level. So... you might ahve figured the trick out...
No? OK, here goes. You select your enemy (or ally! ha) for your attack and
confirm it. Now the cursor (the hand) should be on the next person. At this
time, de-select (Circle) and the cursor is back to the original guy. Do it
over and over (X, X, O, X, X, O, repeat). The reason why this works is that
the developers programmed the game to count the SELECTION of the attack bar,
not when you USE it. Hell, the programmers probably knew of this trick, but
they just had to leave it in because without it, your weapons would be kinda
weaker because think of the battles that you only had to use one or two 
attacks to win. By the way, you can only level your weapon up once per battle
so don't go doing the X, X, O thing a thousand times! You'll only level your
weapon once in that battle! 

Magic Level... Same as weapons level: select the magic you wish to use,
then the target, then cancel, and repeat up to 100 times. But beware not
to over-level-up your magic, since MP use goes up as your level for that
magic goes up. It's no use having a strong magic if you don't have
enough MP to use it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ASK/MEMORIZE/ITEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A unique addition for this game: the Keyword/Memory system. Throughout the
game, you will undoubtedly hear new terms that you have to learn to get
along. In the previous (and future!) games, you would just talk to anyone and
they'd know what you were talking about. Not in this game. You will have to
actually ASK people the SUBJECT and they might tell you what's up. The key
terms are rather easy to spot, it's always in red. When this happens, select
the 'Memorize' option and it's in your log book! Yay! 

To ask a person, just select the 'Ask' option after you've come up to the
person and pressed X to have a chat. Some people will know what to tell you,
but not everyone.

Also, in some courses throughout the game, you will have to give or show a
person a certain item. To do this, select the 'Item' command and select the
item! It's all simple!

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   SAVING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bit different from Final Fantasy 1. Well, completely different. The ONLY
time, and I mean ONLY, you can save on your MEMORY CARD is when you're on land
in the overworld. However, there is still a MEMO FILE available. Like Final
Fantasy 1's, it allows you to save anywhere, even in the dungeons. That way,
if you made a stupid mistake in a deep place, you won't have to re-do the
entire thing or even more. BUT... once you turn your PSX/PS2 off, it's all
gone since it is stored in the disc not the hardware or the memory card. Tough
luck. *shrug*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ONE MORE THING...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Scarlet recommended me to discuss the 2 Weapons versus one Weapon and a
Shield. RS has told me that he prefers two weapons over one and a shield.
Myself, however, has always used one and one. Both sides has its highs and
lows, but they're around equal. 

TWO WEAPONS
    Of course, you would opt for this since, if both of them connects, they
would combine to execute a LARGE number of damage to the enemy. Yeah, it
would rock... BUT there is an if. IF BOTH of them connects. As you could have
seen in the menus while you were fondling with them, each person is either
right-handed or left-handed. What does it mean? Yes, it is their DOMINANT arm.
So, the weapon on that arm will use the weapon to its fullest potiental. On
the other hand, literally, will only do the partial amount. The partial effect
also has a effect on its ACCURACY! Shocking... You don't know what it means?
It just means that the weapon on that arm will miss more than it should. While
it does miss, it does hit sometimes... Ultimately, the theory of this one
would be: "It miss, yeah, but if it works, it's awesome! It's like 'just in
case'." Remember, the weak arm has an impact on the STR and ACC.

One more advantage: if you use two different weapons, you could level them
up at the same time, making it easier to level them all. But eh.

ONE WEAPON AND SHIELD
    That's where I come in. You got the weapon on the stronger arm, hacking
at the bad guys with powerful strokes. The other arm is left to dry out...
with a stale shield. Sounds horrible? Wait until you get this... the BEST
shield would only absorb 10% of the attacks. Even worse now? Not for me. 
Having a shield have saved my ass several times, especially in tough battles
with guardians. It has a cumulative effect on your HP. In one battle, it
won't look much if it absorb only one... but if you trek through a large
dungeon such as Jade Passage/Pandaemonium, you will absorb more and more
attacks, rather strong mind you, and it adds up. You use less MP for curing
and you save yourself the trouble of reviving, perhaps. That's why I wear
my ever-trusty shield... I'm alright with one.

BOTTOM LINE
    Both sides are useful, so don't go straight to my method because _I_
use it or go to the 2 weapons because it sounds so bad-ass. Think it over.
In fact, I equip my first three characters with a sword and shield and equip
the fourth character with two weapons. You do whatever you like, I don't
care. I'm just doing my hobby, which is to educate you about this game.

We'll start off simple. Select your character's names and press Start... and
watch a fantastic FF8-esque cinema including a wizard casting arson upon a town
with helpless, hapless fools... Majestic knights with razor-sharp swords come
stomping for more murders... until two brave warriors come forth to save the
children! After a wait, you face 4 Imperial guards, which stopped your run for
freedom. Battle 4 of them, just to get to know the commands of the battle
system. As you can tell, the system is turn-based... Think Final Fantasy I,
not Final Fantasy X, tho. Go ahead and watch as your team gets obliterated...

Heh, heh...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rebel's Hideout
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the inevitable loss, you see a bright white light... No, you're not 
dead. Not yet. It's some rabbi (no, not a rabbi, it's just an attempt in being
funny. I'm sorry) reviving you up. You hear a conversation between a lady and
a gentleman about the state of your health. Not important as of now. Just as
they were leaving, you suddenly wake up. Looks like nobody's here... 

You meet up with two of your comrades, Maria and Gus. No Leon?!?! Oh well, 
it's just a story, this was supposed to happen (wink). You guys shrug it off
(WTF?) and goes back to the princess Hilda, who saved you all, for an audience
for some thanks and all that crap. At the throne room, you ask the princess
(should be the queen to me but whatever) for the permission to join her
honorable rebellion group. Sadly, she turns you down and demands you to go
back to your hometown. You PWN her by telling her that you have no family
anymore (*sniff*) so she lets you stay and live in her castle as long you
know the password. So... after the conversation, go up to the princess Hilda
and ask her about the password. Memorize the password: 'WILD ROSE'. Ask her
with the password to learn about Leon: he's at Fynn!

Finally, you have the opportunity to get out of the smelly room. At the left
side of the main room, there's a chest with a POTION. What else? Nothing
except the door leading to the town!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several stores around, and all of them should be familiar to you
if you've played the other game in this collection. There's an Inn, a 
Sanctuary, a Weapon shop, an Armor shop, an Item shop, and a Magic shop.
The Magic shop has BOTH of the types: White and Black. Except this time,
it's not really called White or Black... it's just magic. You have 400 Gil,
which is very little but I recommend you to go to the Magic Shop and spend
200 Gil on a Cure Scroll and use it on one of your characters (Maria is the
best choice). The other 200? Up to you. (Bought another Cure spell for me,
used it on Firion)

Get out of the town to train!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Training!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you should have been acknowledged, there are no levels in this game.
Instead, you are greeted with a furious level-up method. If you want more
HP, you have to lose HP (half of your HP is best)... want more MP? Use it
often in battle! Strength? Attack often! Makes sense? Good! Just stick around
Altair and train with Hornets, Goblins and such. Just attack yourself until
there's half of your HP left and kill the monsters off. You should be rewarded
with a HP bonus (well, most of the time) AND an endurance bonus, which 
strengthens your defense/protection. Another trick: (an infamous one among the
FF2 gamers) press the attack button and select the enemy and confirm the
cursor on the monster. Then decline it. Re-do it many times (up to 100) and 
you should get a weapon level up at the end! Simple! Cheating? Yep. You want
the honest way, suit yourself. You'll find out pretty soon why I did it.

Anyway, I leveled myself up to 350 HP for Gus, 110 or so for Maria, and 200
for Firion. Not a bad start, could've been better but whatever! ^_^ Make sure
you level your _HP_ first because if you level your weapons first, you'll 
kill yourself instead of attacking for half of your HP! LOL

Also, you might want to select your rows, the back rows can use the Bows to
attack from afar while using Magic. People in back row can still cast Magic
as well as anybody but it can't attack as well except with the Bows. Those
people take less physical damage, though.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatera
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head north from Altair, over a puny bridge and continue north. Behind the
cowering forest lies a small, homely town of Gatera. Rest at the Inn if you
like, but there's nothing special to buy or mention here. Just leave to the
west. 

Hug the lake's shore as it goes up and left. After walking west then east, you
should be able to see a grassy plain directing south. Having said that, you
know that you have to go there. Therein lies your first castle, Fynn!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fynn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DO NOT TALK TO THE GUARDS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE PICKED APART LIKE A FLY!!!
Simple as that. Now, the shops are all abandoned so they are no use. What to
do? I guess you could go to the pub, which is always filled with people with
information. Now, go all of the way to the north, JUST past the wooden fence.
Just one step. One. Turn right and go down the first chance you have. After
all that, you have discovered the pub, despite its bad zoning. 

In the pub, you see a ton of knights, the ones Firion fought in the opening
cinema, standing around, full of booze. You see a rogue man standing in the
corner, looking suspiciously. Talk to him and tell him the password (Wild Rose)
and he will recognize you as one of the rebels and tell you a secret: he's
blocking the entrance to a secret path. He moves on and lets you pass. Enter
the hole that he was blocking.

You find a room with three chests: all POTIONS. Take them all and talk to the
man in bed (ask him with the password, of course) and he will exclaim about
the conditions back home in Altair. He will, while telling you the secrets of
his life and Hilda, give you your first key item: the RING! Sadly, he 
perishes... All for naught? Not yet! There's nothing to do here so get out of
here and go back to your town of Altair.

*Note: You can now use the World Map: Circle + Select.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, forget about that sad example of a town, Gatera. Bypass it to Altair.
Enter the house stationed on the middle of the zone to re-enter the mansion
of Hilda's. Go up to the throne room and show Hilda the Ring that the befallen
comrade in Fynn gave you. She will recognize it as Scott's and grieve the 
loss. However, she will applaud on your toughness and bravery and let you join
the rebel force (like you didn't already!). Your next mission: to retrieve the
uber-powerful Mythril, a metal. Memorize the keyword: MYTHRIL. Now, talk to
the guy next to the princess (he revived you in the beginning, remember?) and
he will abruptly join your party as a great magician. His name? Mindu. Really,
he's not all that important BUT you have to recruit him to order to get a
transportation method: the CANOE! Before leaving, talk to the Princess one
more time. You will learn about a new term: the DREADNOUGHT, an airship.
Memorize it and ask her about it. Another term to memorize: the AIRSHIP, a
strange machine made by the now-famous Cid.

Get the hell out of here (don't forget to shop a bit *wink*) to look for the
Mythril!!!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paloom
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get to the port land of Paloom, just make good use of your canoe. Head
north of Altair to find a lake (east of Gatera) and step into it. Your party
will use the Canoe automatically so don't worry about going into your menu or
anything. Now that you're in the water for the first time, head to the east.
Alas! (maybe I'm exaggerating a bit too much since it doesn't take THAT long)
Paloom! You can enter the town and snoop around if you want to. The shops 
aren't that much different from the other towns that you have been to...
The magic shop has nothing special either.

Talk to the sailor just next to the entrance, standing around impatiently, and
he will offer you a bargain: 32 Gil for a ride to Poft! Accept it, of course!
Go back outside and get on the ship floating on a wharf for a lightning-quick
ride!

*Note: You could take the Ether from Mindu's inventory and sell it for 1500
Gil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poft
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shops here have the exactly same items as the ones in Paloom so don't
bother. AGAIN! The shops here suck!!!! Man! You could go into the Pub and
talk to Mr. Cid himself if you want to use the Airship. He can guide you to
Bafsk or Salamand for some Gil but I recommend you to decline for now. Just
take a good walk for some cheap-ass training, heading to the north. 

Walk to the north until you reach a set of snow-capped mountains and turn
left for a bit to find your next destination: Salamand.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salamand
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUESS WHAT?!?! This town actually has some DECENT equipment!!! Yay!!! The
first thing I did: bought me a shiny new LONG SWORD!!! My Firion officially
kicks ass now. I know you must be very low in money so be careful and pick
what you think you need the most. Make sure you talk to people strolling
around outside to learn about the slaves in the Semmit Falls. The most 
important person: Josef, which is in the house to the right side. Ask him
(he's standing right next to a bed) about Mythril and he says he knows of
it but he won't tell you about it unless you save the hostages/slaves in the
falls! Meh. 

Keep in mind: When you have 1500 Gil or more, make sure you come back here and
buy the improbable Life spell. It's ALWAYS important, y'know.

Going to the Semmit Falls yet? If so, here's the directions: (although the
people in the town stated that the cave is to the south, we will go otherwise)
Go west, through the mountain ranges (top: snowy, bottom: brown) and hug the
bottom range until it ends. You should be able to see a lonely stream
connecting the open sea to god-knows-what. Hop onto your Canoe and ride the
river to the east. After emerging at the mini-lake with some waterfalls 
around, hug the mountains to the north and land at the thin strip of land.
On that piece of land, there's a cave leading down to...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Semitt Falls
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 10 Gil; 200 Gil; Eye Drops; Potion; 50 Gil; 1 Gil; Fire Scroll; Warp
       Scroll; Mythril
Monsters: Balloon; Goblin Guard; Goblin; Loper; Sasquatch; Zombie; Green 
          Slime; Solider
          
*NOTE: Make sure you have Ice and Bolt ready! (Bought at Altair, used to kill
Green Slimes here)

This dungeon is literally NOTHING to you if you have, at least, been training
adequately via the 'cheap' method. If you didn't... then good luck, brother.
I applaud your bravery. Anyway, the monsters here aren't really a threat...
they're just normal monsters for now. Just kill them for Gil but don't 
overkill yourself (for HP bonuses or whatever) because you will face a boss
in the end so you need some HP remaining.

  B1F
  ---
Cool and cozy here. Not bad. As you're walking, you may have noticed a 
vivid blue crystal etching itself in the dungeon, full of aura. Well, as of
now, it's not valid. Nothing you can do about it. Continue on. The first fork
you see, take the left path for a chest with a puny 10 GIL. Come back to that
fork again and take the thin path to the south. You have two options: to the
left is the stairs to B2F or to the right is a chest with 200 GIL. 

  B2F
  ---
Not cool and cozy anymore. You will get your boots drenched. Go to the 
northwest-most corner for EYE DROPS. On the blue co- I mean, southeast corner,
a POTION is waiting for you. To the north, hidden away behind some water, 
there's another POTION in a chest. After some serious fighting (or not), head 
north from the potion corner to the northeast. You stumble upon a wall with 4 
menacing doors. Where will they lead? I shall, of course, tell you. 

D = Door

  D     D     D     D
 B3F   BAD   BAD   BAD

So, enter the left door to go down to B3F. The other doors will lead to an
empty room with a heightened encounter rate. That's all. Little harm will be
done to you.

  B3F
  ---
Only 2 chests: to the south of the entrance has one with 1 GIL. The other one?
To the left, in the middle of the room, beyond a bridge: 50 GIL. That's it. 
Again, there are several doors here, but the correct one? The left door,
all of the way to the extreme end. 

If you entered the correct door, you finally find the hostages! Yayies! Talk
to the black-armored ninja, Pavel. He will ask you to distract the guards 
while they flee to freedom. You may go back to Salamand if you like to gather
new information from Josef but you don't have to. Just continue on to B4F.

  B4F
  ---
Simple yet long. Get across the first bridge to get a nice, nifty prize: a
FIRE SCROLL. Our first decent treasure! Go us! However, our path to B5F isn't
that easy. Bear with me... Go to the next fork, and go north, across the 
BRIDGE. If you went over some stone path, you will see a wooden door. It leads
to a hell-bent room so don't go there. Just go to the bridge to the north. 
Walk around the entire room to the stairs.

  B5F
  --- 
o_O If you want the Warp Scroll, which could be useful but you can live 
without it... You have to go over the LONG bridge and walk around to the
chest and run all of the back. There's one more catch: as you open the chest,
a monster suddenly jumps at you! 

It's a Spiketoise... It wasn't tough to me but I can imagine it being tough. 
Just have your Mindu cast Shield on your party since the monster tends to 
attack physically. If you have the Ice magic, USE IT!!!! If not, tough luck. 
You have to endure through it all because the turtle is a turtle, literally. 
Physical attacks won't work so you have to use your magic to the fullest. Chip
his HP away, I suppose. Haha! Two Ices should be enough. 

Want to proceed to B6F? Go back to the entrance and head up, ignoring the 
bridge that led you to the infected chest. Take the LEFT door. Yep, that's
the door.

  B5FB
  ----
You see a monster blocking your way to a chest... Yeah, it's a boss (surprise)
so save on your Memo and heal up.

______________
BOSS: Sergeant
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 140

  If you have trained a LOT, it will GREATLY help you in this battle. Believe
  me, it did with me. My Black Mage (Maria) has no MP, due to my forgetful
  mind (forgot to heal at the Inn). So... I relied on my physical attackers to
  take him down. If I didn't train as much as I did, I would be toast. Firion
  and Gus's weapon levels were at 6 so I was physically prepared. The boss'
  defense is nearly identical as the Spiketoise but a bit more forgiving. My
  Gus were able to damage him for 40-49 points despite his shell-like defense.
  Firion? 15-20. But from my pervious experiences, you can easily defeat him
  with magic, like Spiketoise. So, if you have trained a lot, just cast Shield
  on your party and let 'er rip. If not, use your MP. Simple as that. 

  As for his attacks, he will use his Arrows quite frequently so be prepared
  to use Cure or even Life. Good luck with your first boss.

After the victory, snag the prize! MYTHRIL is all yours!!!! Just warp outta
here and head back to Altair! Well, you could stop by the town of Salamand to
heal or to see Josef again. Your choice. Either way, you have to go back to
Altair.

                           CHAPTER 2 - DREADNOUGHT
                           =---------------------=
                                -Dreadnought!
                         -Seeking the Goddess's Bell

                           -Into the Dreadnought!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Want to go back to Altair? Just go back to the town of Poft and enter the
worthless town. Never mind the shops, just talk to the sailor just outside
the shop for a nice chat. He's the same sailor that gave you a 32 Gil ride
from Paloom. Yep, pay him another 32 Gil to go back to Paloom! Take a hike to
the ship for a quick breeze to Paloom...

Of course, you have to use your canoe again to get to the Altair. Maneuver 
through the obstacles to Altair...

Go ahead and talk to the beauty, the princess Hilda, and show her the Myhtril.
She will exclaim on how great it is to find such a big thing (yawn, too easy)
but she can't do anything with it... but she tells you of a person who can:
Tobul, at the weapon shop. So let's go there! In the shop, talk to the elderly
man standing outside the counter and show him the Myhtril again. He will suck
up and do... his job! The legendary Mythril equipment is up for grabs! Yay!
Unfortunately, they are extremely expensive and I highly doubt that you have
enough money for ONE weapon! Insane, isn't it? Haha! 

What now? let's ask Hilda for another objective... (Remember, you're her 
slave! Heh, too bad!) Ask her about Dreadnought, which she was just talking
about. She will tell you that one of her comrades/spies have found a way to
break into the gigantic ship. Interesting!

Note: After this section, I trained up around here for some HP gaining since
I could attack myself and still be able to take care of myself because the
monsters here are wimps. Just letting ya know... :)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to Bafsk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first part of the path to Bafsk should be easy and obvious: go to Poft
first. Pay the sailor in Paloom 32 Gil and hop in. Now what? There are two
ways: (1) go to the Pub of Poft and talk to the dirty Cid's aide (behind him)
and pay him 100 Gil for an Airship lift to Bafsk. Easy! (2) Or... if you don't
have 100 Gil or is simply too cheap to pay, just walk to the right, around a
small mountain range. There's Bafsk just sitting there, coiled up behind the
city limit walls. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bafsk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shops? Stop being like a teenage girl in a mall. Just buy what you need and
get out. The weapons and armor are alright, but they're not in the level of
Mythril's. You could buy them if you want but I don't recommend it. Save your
money for Mythril equipments. Scrolls (magic)? Nope, they all suck and you
have your trusty Mindu anyway (for now). 

Now, time to search for the double agent, which is in the favor of the 
rebellion forces. The Imperial guards here won't fight you if you attempt to
have a nice conversation with them so don't worry. The agent is to the south-
west, standing on a thin, grassy pathway. Ask him about the Dreadnought and he
will let you pass, to the secret path. Time for some espionage action! (Metal
Gear Solid plug-in, heehee! Maybe Splinter Cell? Who cares!)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Bafsk Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Long bow; Long Sword; Pass
Monsters: Strangler; Solider; Bloodsucker; Balloon; Hornet; Zombie; Goblin 
          Guard

REALLY simple. *scoff* Only 3 floors and you're out. How fun. The monsters are
mostly identical to the ones you faced in Semitt Falls.

  B1F
  ---
On the fork, just go up for a dead end with... a LONG SWORD!!! Nice, for 
sure! Go around the block and go down for the next two forks... on the way,
you'll find another chest (LONG BOW!) and the stairs UP to 1F.

  1F
  --
Kinda confusing here, like a maze. Follow my directions to wipe this floor in
the ass: Head right until you cannot go any further. Head up and follow the
path until you see a path up AND right. Wait... there's a Black Knight 
blocking your way! Oh damn, looks like the dreaded Dreadnought is complete and
armed to the teeth! You watch as Borghen mock you and fly away. That scoundrel!
Oh well... Get back into the cave and go to the right to find ONE more door...
Your last hope. =P

In that room, you find a chest... a new key item: the PASS! What does it do,
exactly? I dunno yet (well, I do know, but wait, you impatient bastard.) To
the right? Just a warp point, back to Bafsk.

You can sleep at the Inn and shop if you like. Return to the origin, the town
of Altair for an audience with the Princess... AGAIN! Boy...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poft
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before going to Altair, just stop by the bar in Poft and talk to Cid. Ask him
the very keyword that he taught you, the Airship. He will utter a new keyword:
SUNFIRE. Memorize it. As for now, you're done. Just go back to your original 
path, to Altair. (You're still on the path, anyway!)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I almost DIDN'T notice, but I did. Did you? The people here seemed to 
disappear and the houses are kinda damaged... What the hell? Must be the
Dreadnought! Damn! Anyway, go into the main house and you should see more
people this time. Probably the shelter now, I guess. Go up to the Princess
and report her the status. After some conversation, Mindu will declare that
he has to stay behind and help people recover. Therefore, he will leave your
party. (who needs him? haha) So you're back to 3 people. Do not grieve, you
will find another replacement pretty soon. Now, ask the Queen about the 
Sunfire (if you don't know the keyword, refer to the 'Poft' section above)
and she will tell its whereabouts (Kai'son) and she will command you to go
to Kai'son to steal the Sunfire away from the enemy. Another mission from
her? When do I get MY freedom??? Bah.

Again, there's one more keyword to learn... Go to the King's recovery room
(his bedroom) to find Mindu tending care of the King himself. Talk to the
King and ask him about the Sunfire. He have heard of it and recalls that you
have to get the GODDESS' BELL (memorize this!) and use it to open the door
to the Sunfire. The only people who knows where the Bell is the Kai'son Clan.
Thanks, Mr. King! 

However, you don't know of any people who are in the Kai'son Clan so let's ask
your most reliable source of information: Princess Hilda. Ask her about the
Bell and she will tell you that it is located somewhere in the snowy fields,
to the north. Josef knows those areas well so she recommends you to ask him.

Shop around if you like (Mythril items!!!) and leave for Salamand, the home of
Josef.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salamand
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head directly to the house to the right, with a pretty lady in red standing
outside, to find Josef inside. Talk to Josef and ask him (again) about the
Bell. He will say that the only way to get to the cave where the Bell lies is
by a Snowcraft. Where is it? Oh, THAT shiny blue thing in the Falls?!?! Haha!
So that's what it was! Let's go! Josef will join you as a fourth party member!
We're alllllllll good!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semitt Falls
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Snowcraft

Go to the strange, ubitiquous blue stone and bypass it and face the right wall
while on the upper-most row. It might be confusing so I'll draw a map:
 _____
|    >|   
|  O  |
|     |

The 'O' is the stone and face the direction and press X. Josef will take care
of stuff. Just watch, heh. A secret passage pops out... enter it. In that 
room, there is a lone chest. Yep, the SNOWCRAFT. Get out of here.

*NOTE!!!: While you're in the Snowcraft, hold X and press O 15~20 times to
play a game of Concentration. You can win a LARGE sum of money and give you a
weapon head start!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to the Snowfield
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be rather obvious but if you don't know where to go, I'm here to
help. :) From the mouth of the river of Semitt, go north (west of Salamand)
until you see a opening in the mountain range. Turn right into the snow. There
ya go. And yes, you will still fight while on the craft, although the rate is
VERY low. 'Tis a lengthy ride to the east, so if you get lost, just press 
Circle and Select to bring the World Map up. The Snow Cave is to the east,
a small cave in a mountain range.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Snow Cavern
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 100 Gil; 150 Gil; Mythril Mace; Antidote; Battle Axe; Notus; Potion;
       Ice Scroll; Mythril Spear; Potion; Mythril Shield; Ancient Sword; 
       Silver Plate; Goddess's Bell
Monsters: Deadringers; Balloon; Zombie; Yeti; Icicle; Goblin Guard; Goblin;
          Floating Skull; Ghoul; Shadow; Grenade

Again, if you didn't train much, you're going to have a tough time... You
can't warp out of here so you better be in a good shape! No Mindu this time to
heal your sorry ass up either! Just keep your Black Mage's MP high because
you need it for a tough boss later in this cavern. You want to know the 
length? It's alright, not too long, and not too short. 

  B1F
  ---
Nothing special really. Just follow the paths and go into the alcoves along
the way to pick tow treasures up: 100 GIL and 150 GIL. Take the stairs on the
end of the path down to B2F.

  B2F
  ---
This floor does have some items (and they are excellent!) but you can't access
them right now so just go to the next set of stairs. (The door is just a trap)

  B3F
  ---
FIRST, go to the LEFT... to get a can't-miss-item!!! It is not required to get
this awesome item but I force ya to!!! Open the chest: NOTUS. As of right now,
DON'T use it! If you use it in battle, it will cast the deadly Ice-16! Then
disappear... forever. Now, go back to the original fork and go south. Another
split... 

You have a choice: go north to B2F and pick up 3 items or go south to continue
on the main path, to B4F. If you go up to B2F, which I highly recommend, you 
can pick up those items: BATTLE AXE; ANTIDOTE; and MYTHRIL MACE. The last 
chest (Mace) is guarded by a bunch of monsters but I'm sure you can handle 
them. 

Going back to the southern path... it only leads you to B4F...

  B4F
  ---
Kinda open-ended but there are several chests to open. POTION to the 
northwest, tucked away in a corner. To right of the Potion chest... a highly
valuable item: ICE SCROLL. Make a good use of it because you will need to use
it on a boss pretty soon! Going south... two more chests: POTION and MYTHRIL
SPEAR. The spear is pretty powerful, so I gave it to Gus to train it up a bit.
But I won't use it as anyone's main weapon... Back to the story. Go to the
northeast, bypassing a trap door, to the stairs.

  B5F
  ---
NICE ITEMS!!! To the extreme left of the original staircase is a chest with
a MYHTRIL SHIELD, and to the southwest is another one with ANCIENT SWORD! The
sword is guarded though, but not that big anyway. Ooo baby! Nothing can stop 
us now! Want to go further? Go to the southeastern corner for the door. Yeah,
no stairs this time.

  B5FA
  ----
Nothing except giant beavers here. How intriguing. Here's a neat thing to see:
go to the lone beaver in the north. Talk to him and he will say "Gggggrrraahh"
like someone's grabbing his nuts. Gus will come up and talk to him because he,
somehow, can understand animal language. (o_O) You can ask him about stuff.
The best one? The Goddess Bell, of course. The beaver will tell you, via Gus,
that there's a secret path in the right wall. Go to the right wall and up to
the corner and pass through the opening to B6F.

  B6F
  ---
Just follow the winding, snake-like path all of the way. Open the chest for a
SILVER PLATE. Equip it on whomever except Josef (he's not staying for good).
Now, you must have seen the strange creature sitting on the top of the stairs
nearby. It's pretty obvious that he's a boss so get ready. If anyone has a 
Spear, un-equip it because it's no good and replace it with something else. 
As for the Black Mage, if he/she has LOW MP like 1 or 2, you SHOULD equip 
the Notus, if you have it, on whomever and use it in the battle. You should win
it in that turn. Yeah, that simple! If you have a low of MP and Ice in your 
arsenal, you don't have to, just use Ice and you should be fine. Memo-save is
a good idea. Come up to the turtle and fight.

_________________
BOSS: Adamantoise
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 450

  Tough but simple. You got to keep pummeling him with Ice spells. I had my
  Firion AND Maria casting Ice right away. Gus and Josef... I guess they just
  stood there and attacked for no reason. If you don't have Ice or is low on
  MP, can't cast any more... Use Notus if it's equipped on one of your 
  warriors. It should finish the bastard off. Wish I could help more but I
  can't think of any more strategies... Just heal and attack him with Ice. I
  finished him off in 3 rounds that way.

After defeating the thick-shelled monster, walk up the stairs to finally find
the GODDESS'S BELL! A staircase forms before you... Walk up and enter the 
door! 

  B1F
  ---
Yah, you're back at B1F! Almost outta here! Either way, HEAL your party up and
de-equip Josef! Trust me, just trust me. Walk all of the way to the exit, to
the overworld... You're blocked? Yeah, that's Borghen, your next boss!

_____________
BOSS: Borghen
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 240

  Not that hard. Only 240 HP? Just beat his ass up with physical attacks and
  maybe some black magic from Maria, your weakest character. His attacks are
  pathetic anyway. Josef can easily attack him for 180~250 points! Enough to
  finish him off in one hit! Just own him.

You sneak by the fallen body as Borghen wakes up and casts an Indiana Jones:
a rolling boulder!!! AHHH!!! Watch this cutscene, I won't baby-sit you this 
time, just enjoy this touching moment. This scene just reminds me of Yang in
Final Fantasy IV (FF2 on Super NES).

Once in the overworld, just head back to Salamand or Poft to heal up or 
whatever.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poft
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have PLENTY of money (well you should!), shop like crazy! Buy
Mythril equipments, magic, whatever you like. Make sure you keep 400 Gil
because you have to pay Cid 400 Gil for a ride to Kai'son. So, go to the
pub of Poft and talk to the apprentice of Cid's about the ride to Kai'son.
Pay the man and get into the bird.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Castle Kai'son
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Cure Scroll; 300 Gil; Gold Shield; Mythril Axe; Werebane; Mythril 
       Sword; Egil's Torch; Sunfire
Monsters: Adamantoise; Balloon; Bloodsucker; Floating Skull; Ghast; Ghoul; 
          Goblin Guard; Goblin Prince; Hornet; Mine; Ogre; Ogre Mage; 
          Queen Bee; Shadow; Soldier; Spiketoise; Strangler; Wererat; Wraith; 
          Zombie

Although this is a castle, you still have to encounter monsters... this is
a deserted castle so nobody is up keeping it. The monsters here is a level
above the ones you faced in the snow. Not just a notch above... You MAY face
enemies like... ADAMANTOISE!!! Horrifying, isn't it? You will face your first
Ogres here, too. A tough squad of henchmen indeed. Make sure you're in a great
shape and strong (250+ HP perhaps). Two characters with Ice is probably a good
idea since there are Adamantoises and Spiketoises waiting for you. 

  1F
  --
Es facile. Go up and you find the coveted Sunfire. However, you cannot 
manipulate it. You have to up to the top floor to get an unique torch, made
solely for this fire, and return. Go behind the fire to find a sealed door.
Use your Goddess's Bell to crack the seal out. 

  2F
  --
Ah-ha! There's a living human being here! Aye, he is one of Kai'son's royal
family's member: Gordon. He explains that he tried to get the torch, Egil's,
to use the Sunfire effectively but no avail. He requests that he joins your
paths and he does! Back to the Incredible Four! (Equip him with the Myhtril
Spear) Go around the hall.

  1F
  --
Yah, back to 1F. Directly south of here is a chest with a CURE SCROLL. I
suggest you to give Gordon this one because his HP is incredibly low so he
is better stationed at the back of the pack. Grab the scroll and go around the
horn to find another set of stairs.

  2F
  --
Maze-like. You can easily get lost and fight countless monsters. No use in
bumping into dead ends. Take the first road down and hang a right. Follow the
path up and open the chest for a partly 300 GIL. Continue walking on the
path (to the left). You come right into the stairs. Problem solved!

  3F
  --
I've noticed that the enemies suddenly get tougher here. The stairs is so
close by yet it's so far. You have to go to the opposite way to get to the
stairs. When you get to the mini-hall with sets of pillars, take the second
(middle) path to find an small alcove with a GOLD SHIELD, a worthy addition
to your party. You have to kill a fugly pack of Wererat to get it, tho. 
Blargh! Return to the hall and take the right path down. It leads you to the
boss. No, I'm just kidding. It gets boring when you say 'stairs' every time.

  4F
  --
A lot of people overlooked a great collection of weapon stash on this floor.
Want to know what it has in it? Here goes: a WEREBANE, a MYHTRIL SWORD, and a
MYTHRIL AXE!!! Stunning. Just go left and go down. You see an indent in a wall
with a door on it. Enter the door to find that stash room. Go to the left most
hall and to find the steps up.

  5F
  -- 
On the heart of this room, there is a HEAVILY guarded chest containing a 
GOLDEN MAIL... The guardians? A deadly fleet of Mines. Their attack power is
vastly high, enough to cause 100+ damage to a well-protected character of 
yours. What more, they can cast Self-Destruct 5 which will kill itself BUT
cause a heavy number of damage to one of your character. I remember my first
run here, I made it out with only Firion. He didn't have Life so I had to Warp
out of there and walk all of the way to Bafsk! ^_^ Anyway, save on your Memo
File if you want the Mail. Just attack them with regular attacks and Fire/Bolt
for they are weak against those elements. To the northeast, there's a door 
leading to a small room with ANTIDOTE, MALLET, and EYE DROPS.

After all that, go to the southwestern corner for the stairs back to 4F.

  4F
  --
::sighs:: Another boss! He is pretty tough so heal up and save on your Memo
before fighting, of course. Make sure you have a healer with plenty of HP. I
had 3 people with the Heal spell so I was pretty prepared. Are you?

______________
BOSS: Shrieker
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 540

  Ouch! A tough boss! This one wields a variety of magic: Bolt8, Ice8, Fire8,
  and Poison8 and it's not afraid to use it either. In fact, it will use it
  until its MP is gone. Luckily, that's its own weakness! You have to survive
  its barge of magic until it can't cast any more. Then, you can attack it and
  win since Shrieker usually miss its attacks and when it finally connects, it
  isn't big. So, keep healing in the first 4 rounds to counter the magic. 
  Another thing... DO NOT CAST ANY BLACK MAGIC!!!! Doing so will HEAL the
  boss! Ice, Fire, Bolt, you name it, it will heal it up! Physical damage is
  the only way. It has 540 HP so it'll take ya a while. Life spells might be
  used, don't be afraid to use it. Just survive the harsh beginning and
  the gods of war rewards you.

Blow the boss off and open the chest for the desired EGIL'S TORCH! Warp to the
entrance and re-enter the castle. Walk upon the Sunfire and use the Egil's
Torch to transfer the possession in favor of your party! Alas, the mission is
complete!

As you start to walk outside, you witness a nifty scene with Cid's ship trying
to avoid the villain, Dreadnought. You can do nothing right now because you 
can't fly, duh. Walk to the northeast, and when you walk past the mountain
range to the left, turn left. Hug the shoreline to the north to find Bafsk.
You could stop by right here and heal or walk a bit further, to the west,
to Poft. Up to ya. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a stop at Bafsk or Poft (or not), return to your rebel's home base: 
Altair. (Might be a good idea to train some more right now) Enter the royal
palace and seek the Princess. She's not here? I kinda expected that... Now
who do you ask? Let's try Mindu, by the King's side! Go to King's bedroom and
ask Mindu about the Dreadnought. He will say that even the great, unsinkable
Dreadnought has to land and refill... But he couldn't say its whereabouts.
You can ask the people around about it, but the best guy for the job is the
elder in the main room. Talk to him and he will explain you the land spot for
the Dreadnought. It's to the north, way past Fynn. Looks like we got ourselves
a new mission, this time... no Princess to bark us around! ^_^


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Road to the Dreadnought
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Tis a long road and an arduous one. So, train and gain some HP around Gatera
or Altair before leaving. Then, use your canoe to get across the lake between
Gatera and Fynn. Bypass Fynn (soldiers still lurks around there) and continue
walking northward. The difficulty of the monsters shifts from below pathetic
to feverishly dangerous around here, so be aware of the fact. Anyway, keep
going until you see a circle of trees cowering over a parked Airship... Yep,
that's Dreadnought! Save before entering and enter!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Dreadnought
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 400 Gil; Shade Bow; Thief's Gloves; Potion, Potion; Crescent; 
       Main Gauche; Trident; Ice Shield; Titan's Helm
Monsters: Balloon; Captain; Ghast; Ghoul; Helldiver; Hill Gigas; Mine; 
          Sergeant; Shadow; Soldier; Stunner; Warlock; Werepanther; Wererat; 
          Wraith

Heh, I remember my first time here. It was a bad experience. As you go up the
primary stairs, you are being blocked by a Black Knight. He won't fight you,
but he won't budge either. Not even an inch... What to do? Two ways that 
would work: ask him about the 'Wild Rose' OR show him the Pass that you 
received from a chest long, long time ago. I'd prefer taking the latter one
because if he finds out that you're part of the rebels, he will FIGHT you!
Aiiiii! He has 750 HP so beware. Remember when I said something about my
first time here? Well, yeah... I told him about Wild Rose and... I fought
him. Guess what? I won. Yah. Showing the Pass... he will gladly let you pass.

*A GREAT tip for defeating the god-damned guards from Jlb7864: 
"I found that while fighting in the dreadnought if you have sufficient 
capabilities that you can defeat the guards rather easily (ancient sword and
wind sword on firion helps a lot) and they will drop gold armor (helps against
poison) and has better armor rating than mythril and flame bow (imbued with 
the essence of fire). I kept my characters using the same type of weapons 
they started with and the flame bow is awesome on the chick (changed the 
names cant remember her name) it also sells for decent money."

  1F
  --
Tough enemies here, indeed. To the northwest, a chest with 400 GIL can only
be reached via a staircase. Now, there are three staircase, all equally 
deserving. In the middle of the room, the main hub, a staircase is flanked
by two Knights. It leads to a small pathway to a powerful weapon, CRESCENT.
However, the main door is slammed shut. You have to go back to the room
that you entered and go east to find a secret room. The chest is guarded by
some soldiers and its comrades but nothing you can't handle.

  2F
  --

Now, the next stairs? Go up the main stairs and hang a right and take the
first right down to another stairs. Follow the path up to a door. Now you're
in 2F. This is required, and I highly recommend getting the items because 
the rest of the dungeon is VERY straightforward, no side-paths to find. Get 
all four items here and you go straight to the top floor, no strings attached.
Anyway, as you come upon a fork, you can pick left or right. To the left is 
another fork: to the left is SHADE BOW, a nice weapon; to the right has 
another split... take the left one to find an useful THIEF'S GLOVES. Now 
return to the ORIGINAL fork... to the right, you have to follow a long path 
to two chests: POTION and POTION. That's it for now. While going to the chest
with the Thief's Gloves, you may have noticed two imprisoned people to the 
right... That's Hilda and Cid! Imagine finding them here on 2F so easily! 
Open the gate and talk to Cid. He requests you to go up to the top floor
and destroy the engine with Sunfire while he will escort the Princess out. 
How romantic...  The following ASCII map is for this floor. I know my 
written directions are kinda choppy and repetitive so here it is.

    S
    |_____                         S--- Start

 SB   TG__|________CP


Now, the FINAL stairs, the one you were SUPPOSED to take in the first place.
On the same upper path before the stairs to the previous floor (with 4 items)
and go down. Just follow the path to the stairs.

  3F
  --
The sheer size of my explanations of the previous floor spooked you a bit,
didn't it? Yeah... I rule. Walk around the room to the green door. That's all.
Relieved to see a short one, huh?

  4F
  --
Go to the middle of the room. You see a set of stairs. That's the way to 5F.
There are some easily accessible items further right... There are four of those
but one of them is guarded by a very, very, very dangerous monster: Hill 
Gigas. You have to get them all right now if you want the 100% Collection rate
because you can't go back to this hell hole after you destroy it (it deserves
that anyway). So, heal your party up and save on your Memo File before opening
the chests. Now, equip two of your men with an Ancient Sword and a Crescent.
Then you can EASILY kill him. Crescent will put him into Sleep, preventing his
attacks. Ancient Sword, as an insurance attack, will cast Curse on him...
decreases his accuracy greatly. Easy victory. The items: (in order, left to
right) TRIDENT, MAIN GAUCHE, ICE SHIELD (Hill Gigas), and TITAN'S HELM. All
of them are the best ones you've discovered yet. Go up the stairs.

  5F
  --
After a small room surrounded by some mechanics knights, you come into a rather
simple room plagued by dishonorable knights. The exit is close by, but Knights
infested the hallways so you have to get around and get there the LONG way.
Don't even bother trying to beat them, because if you succeed, it will 
re-appear anyway. Follow my directions to get there: (from the fork right of
the stairs; every direction is for every fork you get to, whether if one of 
the paths is blocked by a Knight or not) 

Up, Up, Left, Down, Down, Right, Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Up, Right, 
Up, Up, Left, Left, Down, Right, Down, Left, Up

You could do the job by yourself pretty easily, though. Not that hard to 
detect the Knights and find the remaining path(s).

After getting to the final door, you come upon the gigantic, monstrous engine
of Dreadnought. Use the Sunfire and throw it into the engine and watch the
fireworks! Yay! July 4! A Black Knight comes forth and Maria, somehow, 
recognizes her voice as her brother's. (We all know that it is indeed true
since it always happens. So tedious.) You watch as the squad run and run
all of the way to Cid's airship. As the Dreadnought evolves into a heap of
ashes, you flee to Altair...

                      CHAPTER 3 - THE KING'S LAST WORDS
                      =-------------------------------=
                                 -Meet Leila
                             -Meet the Wind Drake
                               -The Dragon Egg
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

De-equip Gordon because his job is done. Soon. Heal up and sell excess stuff
if you need to. Go over to the HQ and go to the King's side. Firion will 
hastily come up to His Majesty's side to see the death. His final words:
Gordon is to take control of the army (told you so, he would leave! heh);
Mindu is to get the unknown Ultima Scroll (sounds interesting); and you are
commanded to go to Deist to acquire some partners to fight the evil empire.

Now it's back to three... Go up to the throne and talk to Admiral Gordon. He
will tell you of DRAGOONS, so memorize it. Ask him about the mysterious 
Dragoons and he will provide you one more key term: the WIND DRAKE. Memorize
it... Again, he gives you one final piece of information: to get to Deist,
you have to find a boat stationed at Paloom and ride it to the Dragoon-city.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paloom
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly, you already see a new face in the town as you enter this otherwise
bland town. Talk to the first female you see and she will automatically
offer you a ride to Deist... for free! Maria, like a wise woman would do,
senses danger from her. Despite her best intentions, Firion still accepts the
seemingly generous offer. The ship is to the east so go and hop in.

After a leisurely ride, the screen fades and shifts to a more personal view.
Looks like Maria was right, she isn't as sweet as we thought! She tries to
steal some of your stuff (and probably try to force us to walk the plank!).
Eight pirates will fight you, but they're fatasses so make them pay for their
fatness. 

After the battle, Leila will apologize profusely (maybe not...) and admits
power over to you. Firion won't punish her at all... instead, he will grant
her the power of the fourth party character! The sweet, double-handed Leila
is now yours! Not for long, tho. You also gain a new medium of transportation:
the SHIP! Congrats for making thus far...

Now you need to find Deist, but you don't know where. So bring your world map
out. Deist is on a small island off the coast of Bafsk. From the rendezvous
point where you fought the pirates, go south then east, to the snowy 
mountains. Continue sailing south and you should be in Deist's general area.
use the map to narrow it down. 

If you forgot how to bring the world map, here it is: Circle + Select. Don't
forget the next time!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deist
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you come into this mostly empty castle, you see a lone boy with no one
else around him... Talk to him and he will storm off. Hmph. Follow him and
talk to him again. He blubbers something like his mommy (what a wimp) and
leaves yet again. Go up to 2F.

Open the chest to the left for a COTTAGE. Walk to the right, to the stairs
down to 1F. If you went down on the fork, take the second door you see to 
find a room with three scrolls: CURSE SCROLL; STOP SCROLL; and STUN SCROLL.
One more: UNICORN'S HORN, it is found on the end of the hall. Go all of the
way to the fork and go left. Behind the door is a king's stash!!! GOLD NEEDLE,
EYE DROPS, ANTIDOTE, SAGE'S WISDOM, CROSS, SAINT'S SPIRIT, MALLET, and a
WING BLADE is all yours. Well, more like an item king collector! The Wing
Blade is an excellent weapon addition for your extensive arsenal. 

Go back to 1F and go down, ignoring the child and his mother, to find one
more stairs... It just leads you to a rare item: PHOENIX DOWN. 

Now, you have collected all of the items. Now, you can go talk to the woman
and her crybaby of a son. Ask her about the Dragoons and Wind Drake. She
explains that the Wind Drake, which is in the room behind her, can only be
spoken with if you have a pendant, which is in a cave around here. If you 
attempt to talk to the Dragon (Drake), you won't get anything out of him...
Only way to go now? To a nearby cavern, to the north.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Deist Cavern
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 30 Gil; Pendant

Follow the light green path behind Deist to find the hidden cavern of Deist.
No, I won't give you a detailed intro because you won't be staying here for
long.

  1F
  --
Wish things were this easy... you suddenly see a unprotected treasure chest
to the right with 30 GIL. Bwahaha. Behind the chest is a little path leading
to a stairs. 

  2F
  -- 
You find a fragment of a Dragoon lying on the floor... Examine it to find the
PENDANT! Get the hell out of here and go back to the Wind Drake!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deist
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can communicate with Mr. Drake himself, via the tongue of Dragons!
Ask him about the Wind Drake and he will grant you the DRAGON EGG and requests
you to put it in the spring hidden down in the depths of the cavern.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deist Cavern
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 30 Gil; Mythril Mail; Mythril Helm; Potion; Mage's Staff; Mythril 
       Mirror; Mythril Gloves; Mythril Shield; Acid Bottle; Sage's Wisdom; 
       Flame Bow; Saint's Spirit; Knight's Armor
Monsters: Adamantoise; Deadringers; Ghast; Ghoul; Gigantoad; Hill Gigas; 
          Howler; Ogre; Ogre Chieftain; Ogre Mage; Revenant; Screamer;
          Shadow; Sliver; Spiketoise; Wraith

NOW this is THE run that propels you to the depths! This damp, greenish 
place has varied monsters, from Adamantoise with 450 HP to Screamer with 
only 6 HP... There's also Gigantoad (450 HP) and Ogre Chieftain (300 HP) 
so it's pretty safe to say that this place is fairly tough. What's more, 
there are MANY branching paths so you will encounter many of those 
dangerous MANY times. Gear your party up and blast off!

NOTE: You will fight MANY Hill Gigas this time, probably your most encountered
enemy in this cavern. So, don't be afraid to leave for your ship to Bafsk's 
Inn. Just take your time and fight wisely!

  B1F
  ---
Neglect the northeastern path, you have already taken it, remember? Got the
Pendant? Yeah. Now, there are two paths remaining. One to the left, and 
another one to the right. Each one goes down to the bottom of the cavern but
only one will get to the spring. So which one? Well, if you took the left one,
you will end up getting 5 items. And a dead end. So that leaves the right one
as the correct one. Left path is for those who want 100% Collections rate so
if you are, read on!

LEFT PATH
---------
  B2F
  ---
Just get the POTION on the way and dive deeper to B3F.

  B3F
  ---
Shouldn't be hard. Stairs are at the end of the tunnel.

  B4F
  ---
It's a fairly long pathway, but no items. Keep going north and you should
get to the stairs. The path that branches to the left goes nowhere.

  B5F
  ---
Finally, a room of high caliber! It's at the end of the tunnel, to the right.
The chests on the top has a FLAME BOW, SAGE'S WISDOM, and a SAINT'S SPIRIT, 
and the bottom one has a KNIGHTS ARMOR but it is guarded by a GROUP of 
Adamantoises so you probably need to save on your Memo File beforehand, for
the safety's sake. You can cast Warp on yourself to disappear back to outside.
Not a bad idea to ride the ferry back to Bafsk and heal up for the Right Path.

RIGHT PATH
----------
  B2F
  ---
Well start off with going in order, so here we go. The first path going down
will lead to a chest with MYTHRIL HELM. The next path (going up) has a nice
MYTHRIL MAIL, which you probably don't have. The stairs down to B3F (which
will go to the final level so this is the 'right' one) is on the third 
branching, but there is one more valuable item to find up ahead. Instead,
continue on until you see a fork, up and down. Go down first to find a MAGE'S
STAFF (guarded by Screamers). Now you can go back to the previous staircase.

  B3F
  ---
DON'T GO ON THE BRIDGE! Just ignore it and get the two chests to the north:
MYTHRIL GLOVES and MYTHRIL MIRROR. Damn, you're loaded with Mythrils now! Ha.
Curious about the bridge? The reason for the our absence is the hole in the
rusty bridge. If you walk too far onto the bridge, you'll drop down to B4F.
Isn't that where you wanted to go anyway? Well, no. You will be in the WRONG
place of B4F so you have to backtrack to get back. Go back to B2F for now.

  B2F
  ---
Go left and up to find another set of stairs to B3F. Told ya, there was an
another way around! ^_^

  B3F
  ---
Pick the MYTHRIL SHIELD up and go and tiptoe on the cliff going north. 
Remember, don't go on the bridge unless you want to backtrack! Just follow
the general path to B4F.

  B4F
  ---
Before going to the next stairs, which can't be missed, make sure you grab
the ACID BOTTLE to the north.

  B5F
  ---
Hmmm... There are 4 doors to pick and a nasty monster waiting, obviously,
for someone like you to come behind them. Which to pick? The second from the
right is the correct one. Enter through that door and heal up/save. Boss time!

________________
BOSS: Chimera(s)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 640 each

  Yep, you might face multiple bosses at once! You could get lucky and face
  only one but... on the other hand, you can be even luckier and face 4! You
  could use the Memo File to your advantage and Soft-Restart over and over
  until you only face 1, go ahead, I don't care. Now, this lioness has a
  potentially nasty spell: Blaze. True Final Fantasy fans know what this spell
  does: fire-like heavy damage to every character. So, if you have the Shell
  spell, use it right away! Your priority is your White Mage, the one that is
  supposed to have Cure and Life. Don't let him/her die or the battle is
  basically over if you don't have any other character like that one. Keep
  pummeling them with physical attacks, since they are vulnerable to physical
  damage, unlike some of the previous bosses. Magic works, but not as good as
  your weapons. If you have made thus far, this baddie should be no match
  because you have survived countless Hill Gigas... or did you?

Fulfill the great Wind Drake's wish and put the Dragon Egg to rest, in the
spring behind the slain Chimera. Warp out of here and return to the Castle.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Castle Deist
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you go into the Drake's room, you see that the pedestal where he was on
is empty... Looks like he has perished away to Dragon heaven. BUT, you have 
put the egg into the spring so it's bound to hatch and aid you in the future! 
Return to your base, in Altair.

Altair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the humble adobe of the rebellion, take a chat with one of the guys in
the central room. Any one of them will tell you about the strange behavior of
Hilda's. Hmmm... we better go take a look! Go to her room, the one below her
father's, the King. In the room, you are already nose-to-nose with the 
Princess herself. Yah, she's acting all weird alright. She pulls off a Mrs. 
Robinson and tries to seduce you over. As you try to complete the 'job', the
lady transforms into a fugly snake-like venom!

  She is pretty tough physically, despite her gender. (Yeah, I sound like a 
  sexist, so sue me.) Her main and feared attack is her regular attack and
  that's saying a lot. Why? Because she can damage your character heavily
  AND put her foe to sleep, all at once! And she does it quick and effectively
  since her agility is better than adequate. The best method to winning the
  battle? Just attack. Yep, just keep attacking, no matter what. If somebody
  die, just revive that character, but don't bother healing it all of the way.
  She will only hit one person at a time so don't worry. She also casts Blink
  on herself, making the battle even harder. No worries, stick to the original
  plan and slice her in half.

Hmph. Where is the REAL princess??? Gordon and one of his men comes barging 
in, announcing that there's a tournament held in Palamecia that holds Hilda
as the prize! Gordon voluntary re-joins your party, butting off Miss Leila!
I prefer Gordon over Leila any day anyway.

Palamecia? Never heard of it? Oh, it's just south of Kai'son. Get on your
ship again and ride the currents. Open the world map and click on 'Kai'son'
to see its location. To the south of that castle, you see a small dot. That's
the Chocobo Forest, not your next destination. Further south and a bit to the
right, you see TWO dots bundled together, flanked by a gigantic desert. Yep,
that's Palamecia. There are three ways to enter the desert: from north, south
or the west coast. The shortest would be from the north IF you take a Chocobo
from the forest. If you want to battle some monsters for the Collections rate,
land on the west side and walk horizontally to the little coliseum. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Palamecia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk to the second tier... and you see a royal-look-alike sitting on a throne.
Who's he? Dunno. The gate flips open right front of you. You are thrown back,
wondering what's going on... A shutter to the left opens, and out comes a 
hulking beast, full of thirst for blood. You have no choice but to fight this
behemoth.

  Anti-climactic, to say the least. He is huge, and his HP clearly shows that.
  However, the only thing he does is attack for about 250 damage. That's it.
  No tricks, no magic tricks. Just attack him and heal up whenever necessary.
  Yawn.

After the battle, Firion walks up to the Emperor, hoping for some kind of a
revenge. He fails as the Emperor disappear into the thin air, putting you into
a trap. Four Horsemen comes forth and captures you.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Coliseum
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Antidote; Ether; Elixir; Cottage
Monsters: Captain; Chimera; Deadheads; Deadringers; Doom Petals; Parasite;
          Revenant; Sergeant; Sorcerer; Specter; Splinter; Warlock; Wizard

You got thrown in a cell, you silly fool! Luckily, you have made plenty of
allies and one of them shows up to rescue you! His name? Pavel, from Altair!
Whew! You are back in the hunt for the Princess, who is deprived of her 
freedom, somewhere in this place.

  B2F
  ---
Want the items? First, take the right path to a dead end with an ANTIDOTE,
guarded by some bastards. (I know, for an ANTIDOTE?!?!?! Whatever, man) Go
back to the original cell and go north, right and right to another dead end
with a door. That door leads to a gold mine: an ETHER, an ELIXIR, and a 
COTTAGE. Now, you have collected all of the items in this shithole. Go to the
northeast for the door up to B1F.

  B1F
  ---
While walking on the upper hallway, you must have seen a pretty lady trapped
in a cell thanks looks a LOT like Hilda... Wait... that's her! Yeah, she is
the real one, not an imposter like the last Hilda you saw. So, go down and
find the opening and follow the new path to the cell. Press X on the shutter
to free Hilda! You watch as the lovebirds (Gordon as the other half) get
their sparks flying. Awww... Anyway, Gordon leaves your party for the second
time to protect Hilda (or is he going to... man, I have to stop thinking
dirty! Bad boy!) while you have to find your way to the overworld. Just go
to the stairs to the left to get to 1F.

  1F
  --
Feh. Figure stuff out yourself! Go back to the overworld while you're at it!


Go back to your ship, wherever it is parked at and sail back to Altair yet
again.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altair (How many times do I have to write that damn name?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The town is now empty except for the shopkeepers and several other innocent
bystanders... The soldiers and the royal family are all gone.. Where did they
go? Why don't you ask that question to the rebel standing by the entrance/exit
gate... He'll explain to you that they are up north, camped just below Fynn.
The reason? To eliminate the enemy forces that terrorizes Fynn regularly. Let's
go there, I guess.

The camp is to the left of Gatera, you shouldn't have any problem finding it
in the woods.

Once in the camp, you could tell that the army is already ready to attack.
Behind the men, Hilda and Gordon are both waiting for your arrival. Hilda 
won't really say anything except praise you. Instead, talk to Gordon. He will
say no unnecessary details and get to the point... (unlike me in this guide, 
haha) His command? Go into the castle of Fynn and make sure the commander sees
his last daylight as soon as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Fynn Castle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 1000 Gil; 2000 Gil; 1000 Gil; Golden Mail; Gold Shield; Gold Plate;
       Werebane; Aura Scroll; Potion; Titan's Gloves; Break Scroll; Doom
       Scroll; Toad Scroll;
Monsters: Captain; Chimera; Deadheads; Deadringers; Doom Petals; Ghast;
          Revenant; Sergeant; Sorcerer; Specter; Splinter; Stunner; Warlock;
          Wizard; Wraith

Well, if you want to gauge your skills against the Captains in the town, it'd
be a good idea because they are pretty similar to the ones in the castle.
Anyway, go into the castle. There's no guards... very strange, perhaps they're
too conceited to have one? Ha. Go up to the first opening up to 2F and you
will see the first human being in this castle: Leila! She will, after only one
line, re-join your party. Yahoo! 

Now, the enemies here are VERY annoying and the credit ALL goes to the 
magicians. Warlocks, Wizards, and Sorcerers, you name it. They will suck
the life out of you, literally. Your MP is exposed to them, too. They can
cast Banish, Toad, and whatever. Make sure you save after every 5 minutes on
your Memo File because it's worth it, believe me.

Another note: It'd be really wise if you ignored every chest and went up the
stairs on the every floor because once you beat the boss, the random 
encounters here will be vanquished, giving you full access to the chests
without resistance. 

  1F
  --
Before going up the stairs, make sure you get those chests: 2000 GIL and 1000
GIL to the northeast, and another 1000 GIL to the northwest. If you want some
more items, don't go on the central stairs... go to the western hallway and go
down. Another staircase! Follow the path up to 3F and go right. At the end of
the narrow hall, you find a room with three decent scrolls (kinda): BREAK
SCROLL, DOOM SCROLL, and TOAD SCROLL. Now you can backtrack to 1F. (can't
warp here! *scowl*)

Heal up at Gatera if you need, then come back to the original staircase that
you saw when you recruited Leila.

  2F
  --
The next step is right front of you, up to 3F. But there are a lot of goodies
to find, if you want them. Most of them are old crap that you already have,
but you know that if you want the 100%... To the left, there are three alcoves.
In the middle version, some monsters guard a chest with AURA SCROLL, a new
one! In the south alcove, there's a hidden passage on the west wall. Find it
and go up to get a WEREBANE. 

Going to the other side... again, a chest speared into the middle. A GUARDED
POTION?!?! *shrugs* Looks like Square has some humor under their sleeves. To
the east of the chest, there's another false wall for you to walk through.
If you take this path, go down to get a TITAN'S GLOVES, one of the best gloves
in the game due to the increase in the attack and defense power. Go up to 3F.

  3F
  --
Step up the pace!

  4F
  --
A large, empty room... what could it mean? Maybe it's the throne room? *gasp*
Why don't you walk up and find out? Save on your Memo File before doing 
anything!

BOSS: Gottos
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 2000

  Yah, it's THE commander. Did anyone notice that if you neglected ALL of the
  items in the dungeon, you could only fight little to no enemies here all of
  the way to the boss since the stairs are front of you! Haha! So much trouble
  for nothing! Anyway, back to the point! (sorry!) The boss is a solider so it
  would make sense if he attacks a lot with his trusty sword. It does so he
  will do so. Restore to the usual Blink method and destroy him. 

  Some holes can be exploited: cast Sleep on him... it works well on him. Or,
  you can raise your best fighters' physical damage with a new spell, Aura.
  Magic is okay, but not that effective. Otherwise, just think him as a tough
  enemy, not a boss. Heal up when necessary.

Killing the commander will bring the random enemies down with him! Congrats,
you have made the Fynn holy again! 

Hilda and Gordon will be rewarded with their throne again so they're back in
their original home, Fynn. Talk to them several times to learn the following
pass codes: MYSIDIA, MASK, ULTIMA SCROLL, and EKMET TELOEZ. Learn about them
and go back to the town of Fynn.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fynn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guess what? No more Black Knights here! Whoo! Now you can access the Inn,
shops, people, bar, and the air without the fear of fighting a dangerous
jerk. Sell some of your items to empty your inventory, you're going to fill
it up soon if you don't. The only notable things here is in the Armor shop,
so check the new armor out, they're solid gold so they has to be somehow 
useful. 

Back to the storyline progress... Gordon told you to ask Pavel about the
Mask so seek him in his house, in the southwest corner. In the house, you
see Pavel pacing back and forth (like everyone does in this town). Tell him
the password (Ekmet Teloez) and he will reveal the secret: the hidden path
is in the throne room of Fynn, in the upper right corner!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Fynn Castle (Underground)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Knife; Shirt; Eye Drops; Maiden's Kiss; Potion; Potion; Silk Web;
       Flame Shield; Potion; Blood Sword; Flame Mail; Backstabber; 
       Orichaldagger; White Mask
Monsters: Adamantoise; Brain; Ghast; Killer Mantis; Ogre Chieftain; Ogre Mage;
          Parasite; Revenant; Rhyos; Screamer; Specter; Splinter; Stunner;
          Swapper; Wraith

Go up to 4F, the throne. As usual, go to your destination, the upper right
corner. If you click on the X button while facing the east wall, the 'ask'/
'memorize' menu comes up. Talking to a wall? How strangely erotic. Only
thing that would make sense: Ekmet Teloez! The wall suddenly bursts open...
Follow the newly found avenue to B1F, the secret gates of the battered Fynn!

*Note: Before going down to the Underground (the very stairs before, on 1F),
go right and examine the east wall. You should eventually get to the other 
side. If you do, go down to the next wall, the one that you couldn't get to.
Look around there to find another secret passage. When you finally pop in,
open the door for a GOLD SHIELD, a GOLDEN MAIL, and a GOLD PLATE.


  B1F
  ---
Hmm... This place is a nice drawback to your quest... the enemies are a bit
out-dated so it should be facile. However, the items are spaced apart so you
might have to fight quite more than a few monsters in six open-ended floors.

As a prelude to this dungeon, Square has presented you with three downright
PATHETIC items: a Shirt, a Knife and Eye Drops. Fun! The KNIFE is stabbed in
the southeast, EYE DROPS to the northeast, and SHIRT draped on the heart of
the floor. Done with them all? Northwest... you know what to do.

  B2F
  ---
God, what a joke. The items are still pathetic. We aren't sex slaves, you
know, Square! We need good ones! A POTION is in the same circular hallway as
the one you entered from B1F, and there's one more POTION in the southwestern
corner. The northwestern one has a MAIDEN'S KISS. The last corner, the 
northeast? Yeah, the stairway to heaven.

  B3F
  ---
Yet another corner-based maze. I'll make it quick, so I wont bore you out.
Southeast=POTION. Southwest=FLAME SHIELD. Northwest=SILK WEB, and a few steps
below that chest has the stairs.

  B4F
  ---
A bit more complex than just a chest-in-every-corner theory. In the first
fork, head to the right first to find a GUARDED chest with a BLOOD SWORD
inside. Now, a blood sword can suck the enemy's HP and make it yours but it
has ridiculously low HP so I guess it's worthless but keep it for now, don't
sell it some merchant. Go to the central point of the room and head northeast
for a FLAME MAIL. Southeast is the exit, but don't forget the BACKSTABBER by
the stairs. (God, how can I say 'stairs' differently? So repetitive)

  B5F
  ---
Getting closer to the waterways, as evident by the floods in this floor. Wade
through the waters to the third hallway to the right. On that hallway, there's
a chest guarded by a new monster: Rhyos. He has 750 HP so be extremely careful
fighting him. The reward? Worth it! It's an ORICHALDAGGER, one of the best 
daggers in the entire game, if not the best. Now, there's no stairs this time.
Instead, you have to find the right door. There are several doors here...
which one's the right one? Go to the northeastern passage and enter the second
door from the right. 

Grab the ultimate treasure, the WHITE MASK and go further north and step into
the portal to complete this quest!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fynn Castle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After getting the ridiculously hidden White Mask, go back to your informer,
the royal family in their respective throne in Fynn. Talk to Princess Hilda
(where's the queen, then?) and she will direct you to Mysidia, to the far
south.

Going to Mysidia can be incredibly long or incredibly short. Why don't you
bring up the world map to make it easier? Look at the town that you know as
'Altair'. To the south of the town is, well, a big whole body of water. Beyond
that is another continent. On that piece of land, there are two brightly-
marked dots... The top one is Mysidia. Now that you know where it is, you
can ride your sail to a nearby shore and walk on your own from there. OR...
you could opt to walk along the thin land bridge connecting the continents,
to the west. Up to you. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mysidia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably my favorite town, because of its homely feel with the uber-
sexy black mages (anyone read www.nuklearpower.com's comics?) and its down-to-
earth aura. The shops here are the best ones you have seen yet but probably
not the best you will see. The magic shop has EVERYTHING, every magic you've
seen up to this point! Buy anything you want that you have missed the first
time, it's a great catch-up! The armor shop is a bit weak, not up-to-date BUT
the weapon inventory has some of the STRONGEST weapons you will ever see:
Ogrekiller, Power Staff(!!!), Flame Lance, and Ice Bow (it's ok). Power Staff
is a must-buy. Great time to shop right here.

Talk to the pointy-hat citizens about this very town, the Ultima Scroll, and
the mysterious island out in the sea. As you walk around the town, you might
have seen a stairs down to some underground tunnel. Enter.

In that damp hallway, you see a white goddess that resembles a lot of the
goddess in the Roman myths. If you paid attention what the Princess had to
say, you'd know what to do. Place the White Mask on the statue and it will
attach itself magnetically onto the face. One down, one to go!

Get back to your ship and sail to the southern sea, past the S-like canal to
the right. If you're lost, just bring out your world map (Cirlce+Start) again.
Look at the full map, not the spherical version. At the extreme bottom of the
map, there's a small dot in the middle of nowhere. That's your next 
destination, the Tropical Island. Aye, it's a long ride!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Tropical Island
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Eye Drops; Hi-Potion; Hi-Potion; Ether; Silk Web; Slumber Stalk; 
       Poison Scroll; Poison Scroll; Blind Scroll; Blind Scroll; Silk Web;
       Garlic; Phoenix Down; 1000 Gil; Gaia Drum; Slumber Stalk; Sleep Scroll;
       Thanatos; Black Mask
Monsters: Deadheads; Deadringers; Ghast; Ghoul; Poison Toad; Red Mousse; 
          Shadow; Stunner; Wererat; Wild Horn; Wraith; Yellow Jelly

Don't be spooked by the number of items, the monsters are old and weak. Hell,
you could've literally blew this place apart a long time ago, when you first
got the ship. No worries here, just take your time and get all of the items
before opening the chest to the second mask. However, the paths here are
varied, over-laying so you will get lost occasionally... but again, the
monsters shouldn't cause you any kind of trouble. (However, make sure you
have some Ice and Bolt Magic handy because Red Mousse and Yellow Jelly can
be only damaged heavily by the magic)

  B1F
  ---
The first chest you come to has EYE DROPS, you can't miss that. Go to the
next northern path to find two concaves with a HI-POTION each, your first
encounter with a HI-POTION, this late in the game. Strange. Moving on...
The next path down has another treasure, with an ETHER. After taking all of
those off-paths, you have only two paths left: to the southwest and to the
northwest. Go to the SW first go for a SILK WEB before going northward for
the first deep step.

  B2F
  ---
Head up to find yourself under some ceiling vines, very exotic! To the left
is a prize: SLUMBER STALK. Of course, you'll be overcame with the curiosity
of the nearby staircase... but it only takes you to a chest with an another
SILK WEB. Going further into that path will take you back to the daylight,
but you're still within the Tropical Island. The people here will try to
break your determination of getting the Black Mask, which they preserve.
Ignore them all and seek a Tropical-oid who wears a different clothing than
most of them. He's a shopkeeper so he will sell you some weapons (they suck
anyway so don't buy anything) but he's there for a reason: to clear out
your inventory, give them a breathing room. Go back to B2F.

Continue running the path right of the Slumber Stalk, back in B2F. On the
way, you see three chests: POISON SCROLL, POISON SCROLL, and a BLIND SCROLL.
Cheap crap. There's one more, to the southeast: another BLIND SCROLL! Oh,
well. To the north is the you-know-what.

  B3F
  ---
First, go south for GARLIC and follow the path to the north to B4F.

  B4F

Alright, this level requires a map to explain to you clearly. There are, in
total, 4 primitive stairs to take. All of them lead to a chest. I feel that
words are not required if you have a map so good luck! ^_^

So, if you wanted all of the items, you would go to '5' last. Got it? Good.
The guardians aren't a major challenge so no problem for you and me.

Take the obvious choice right here: open the chest for a SLEEP SCROLL. Go
further south and west for the final door... You see a giant rhino puffing
and huffing before you. Looks like a tough battle here! FOR THE GLORY OF THE
BLACK MASK!!! >_> <_<

  Bah. Yes, bah. All you have to do is attack for 2 rounds and he's down.
  What do he have anyway? Low HP, low armor/defense, low attack power, low
  everything. If you can't beat him, then you should consider training up for
  5 hours. Seriously.

Take the lone chest to uncover the second mask: the BLACK MASK. Like the White
Mask, there's a warp point behind it all.

This one will be a quick one, we got to move on. Heal up and save, as always.
Now, if you're around Mysidia, you would see land on the other side of the
mountain range that borders Mysidia. Go east, following the range to the end,
and go between the ranges once you hit the end. Go west, into the ring of
rockies. Within the open ring lies a collection of peaks with a cave inside.
Yep, the Rod is undoubtedly in there. 

If you're not around Mysidia, just bring your World Map out. On the same
continent the town of Mysidia, you spot another dot to the SE of Mysidia. Yep,
you know what to do. You could either land on the east side, leading to the
opening of the ranges or just take the forestry path from the north.

How to say this... unique? Probably not descriptive enough... Cryptic? Yea,
probably. Each of the floors has two tiers, connected by mini-stairs, which
you WILL use. At first, this may be confusing, but like everything else, you
will get used to it. The items here are pretty impressive, but you probably
have most of them, since you have already visited Mysidia. As for the
monsters... they are pretty tough, all right, but shouldn't prove you any
problems expect for the Flan clan (hey that rhymed!) if you don't have 
strong magic in your lot. I guess that's all. You want more? Too bad.

  B1F
  ---
Remember what I said about the tiers in the floors? Well, you need to go
up to the second tier ASAP. Go left to find the stairs up. Now you rule the
roost! On the left side of the northern passage is a stairs down to a GOLD
HAIRPIN. Then, get on the middle pathway and go right for stairs down to a
NINJA SUIT, a worthy tux to pose. Get back up to the top tier and go down
under to the southern edge. Back on the bottom tier, you see your long-lost
twin! Yay, we're reunited! *hugs* Uh, no... he's a doppelganger, blocking
your way for a reason. You can fondle over him all you want, he won't move.
Your secret weapon? The Black Mask, of course. (bet you came here for this
tidbit info here) He's flash and disappear... Go into the door for the
stairs...

  B2F
  ---
The entrance to B3F is right under you, to the south but the items are to
the northeast. As for the items, one of them is tricky. Get the obvious first
choice, the POWER STAFF in an alcove. Go back up and go view the eastern chest
and drool. How to get there, no stairs?!?! Simple... Just examine every wall
on the lower portion of the east wall that barriers that alcove from the path-
ways. You're bound to find a gap that leads to the alcove with a FLAME LANCE! 
You're done! Go back to the southwestern portion for the door to B3F.

  B3F
  ---
The first chest you should take is to the northeast, to save you some trouble
of fighting extra battles. It can be only accessed by a hidden path... It
should be obvious, it's on the east side of that alcove, somewhere in the
lower part. Take the ICE BOW from the chest. The correct door to take is on
the middle of the east part, but you have to go to the southeast and make a
winging turn. Go down the stairs on the SE and grab the OGREKILLER from a
chest (guarded, though. But bah, you can handle it) Continue going east
and skip the first door you see and follow the path north to the REAL door!

  B4F
  ---
Pretty simple, finally. Follow the path and step up to the top tier. The only
remaining stairs is to the north so let's go. Open the chest at the base for
a POTION. If you want a PHOENIX DOWN, a MUTE BELL, and a GOLD NEEDLE, enter
the door in the middle, to the left. The correct door is in the southeast
corner. (Boy, I sound so technical now... so much dungeons and I'm running
out of ideas to make it interesting, oh well.)

  B5F
  ---
Get the DRAIN SCROLL out of its grave (well it's guarded by undead foes so
it makes sense to me) at once. Go down to find the stairs up, to the walk-
ways. (Boy, do I HATE this hellhole! Too much secret paths to find) Go on the
east narrow road and check the western wall, around the middle. You should pop
into the alcove with 5 chests: POTION, POTION, POTION, POTION (yay, another
one I really needed that NOT), and MINI SCROLL. Return to the original path
and walk to the southwest, past the set of stairs that you entered with. After
dipping down a tier, follow the path to a lone door.

FINALLY! Man, I hated the door searching and hidden-path testing... You're
lucky that I'm here to help you so you don't have to battle countless times
to get what you want. Ugh. Get the treasures: DRAIN SCROLL, OSMOSE SCROLL,
and the CRYSTAL ROD, what you came for. Warp your sorry but happy ass out
of here. *yells expletive words* [This message has been deleted by a GameFAQs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to the Mysidian Tower (NOT the Cave! It's just above here!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heal up and empty your inventory as usual, raking in some serious cash! At
this point, I had approximately 400K Gil... I'm a rich bastard, fear me. Back
to the point... go to the seas north of Mysidia and look for a crescent-shaped
island with the opening facing downward. Now, before you go in there, un-equip
Leila and take what you think is valuable. (Yep, she's going bye bye)

Enter the ring of fire... Viola! You get sucked into the waters!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Leviathan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Headband; Power Sash; Power Armlet; Diamond Shield; Terra Shield
Monsters: Boltfish; Manta Ray; Sea Dragon; Shrieker

Bah, this one barely qualifies as a dungeon, in my opinion. Just a warm-up
to an insanely HUGE tower that's coming up. Also, it's a terrible filler and
an excuse for an intro to a new fourth party character. Ugh. Leila will be
gone... forever. She joins the likes of Gordon, Mindu, Josef, and Leon (!) as
a fallen fourth member.

Intestines
----------
Pretty cool name, huh? You come across a weird liquid substance... If you
step on it, you lose 1 HP. But that's nothing to you right now. Follow the
path and pick up the HEADBAND and a POWER SASH on the way. 

Stomach
-------
No monsters here! Looks like we're not alone... Talk to the guy (looks like
Kain from FF4j for a reason) blocking your path. He wants you to 'prove' the
reason why you're here. Why are you here? The Crystal Rod, of course! Show him
the Rod and he will approve and joins your party for the quest for the Ultima
Scroll. His name? Gareth the Dragoon! Head up to find a POWER ARMLET... then
go to the NW corner for the shutter up.

Mouth
-----
Pretty linear here... To the north is a chest with a TERRA SWORD, which should
be equipped on Gareth right away. To the south is a GUARDED chest with a
DIAMOND SHIELD. Walk past the gigantic, out-of-place teeth and you see a worm-
like creature swirling on the edge. Guess what's behind it? Your ship, of 
course! Heal up and memo file your progress and win your ship back!

BOSS: Barrel Worm

  A quite tricky monster... but that can be solved. His attacks are quick and
  powerful so cast Blink on your party right away. Shell? Nah. His defense is
  tough, but keep attacking with your weapons. Gareth with the Terra Sword is
  lethal against him, probably causing the most damage from your party. You
  will usually use your weapons to attack him so it is a good idea to cast
  Aura or Berserk on your party to boost your attack power. I conquered him
  in only 2 and a half rounds. 2000 HP goes down fast if you have a decent
  party!

Grab your ship back and snob that damn monster away! That Leviathan! *scoff*

Go back to Altair (or wherever) to heal up if you like. Either way, go to the
Tower with your Crystal Rod!

DUNGEON: Mysidian Tower (This one is VERY long, so be READY, I MEAN IT!!!)

Items: Staff; White Robe; Staff; Staff; Flame Shield; Flame Bow; Flame Lance;
       Flame Helm; Flame Mail; Flame Sword; Ice Shield; Ice Mail; Ice Gloves;

O_o A million items to find, a million monsters to face. Well, there are 10+
levels in this towering tower so what did you expect? Let me tell you RIGHT
NOW, something important... Make it several things. It'd be a REALLY great
idea to gain several MP for your primary healer(s) because this is a grueling
test of your party's endurance. Once your MP runs out, you're pretty much
toast, if you're nowhere close to the top. Next one: it's helpful if you head
straight to the next set of stairs on the every floor, ignoring distant chests
and moving on because it saves you HP and MP and time. There are 4 BOSSES 
here (yes, FOUR!) so... I guess that explains for itself. The monsters here
lives up to the expectations and challenges you. DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE THE
WARP SPELL! My heart goes out to you...

*Another helpful tip: (yes another one! yay) Memo-save after every level like
you're a cheating bastard. Cheaters always win, you know that! *wink*

  1F
  --
After PWNING the tower with your great Crystal Rod, you're finally in! Yahoo!
Now, the stairs forward is in the middle of the floor, but if you're gunning
for a perfect 100%, you have 4 chests to find. There are three STAFFS here,
one in NE corner, one in NW corner, and one along the wall on the east side.
The final one? Directly to the north, a WHITE ROBE, which is the only decent
item on this floor. Go on the west side of that isolated room and find a
secret path in (on the west wall surrounding the chest). Well, this is only
the beginning of hell.

  2F
  --
Sweating yet? This is a fiery place, literally. Red everywhere. Again, the
stairs up is so close by (to the south) but the items make this a hassle.
Remember, you can bypass them to save lives. Think of the children! Anyway,
the items: from the entrance stairs, take the northeast fork (out of 6
different paths) to a room with two items: FLAME BOW and FLAME LANCE. Simple
so far. Go back to the rendezvous point and take the southwestern one. At the
end of that path: another fork. To the north is another chest, with another
Fire item: FLAME SHIELD. To the south? The stairs!

  3F
  --
Getting HOTTER!!! Now, there are 4 doors to choose from... as always, there
is only one that will allow you to press on. It's the left-most one. Go
through the painful lava (1 HP damage per step) and enter. You're in the
upper half of 3F now. ignore the concrete floor and go east and pick up a
FLAME SWORD. Now, go back to the solid floor you saw earlier. Here, you will
get A LOT encounters because the makers over at Square likes to torture you.
:( To the left of the stairs is a FLAME HELM, and to the right is a FLAME
MAIL, don't forget them! Go into the door in the middle.

Alas, you face your first true battle of this tower: Fire Gigas. Heal up (but
not too much, it's not that hard) and Memo-save. If you have some OgreKillers,
equip it on those who are fluent in the Axe class. Blood Swords works fine,
too. Talk to the mage and he will suddenly grow and evolve into a gigantic
giant!

________________
BOSS: Fire Gigas
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1800

  If you have the OgreKiller(s) or Blood Sword(s), this battle can be gone in
  a flash. If you don't have them or unequipped, then I guess you're going to
  have a tough time. With the given weapons, just attack and attack and he
  should go down in 2 or 3 rounds. If you don't... casting Ice spells works
  best. Berserk and Aura your attackers to make them stronger because the boss
  won't give in so easily.

After the battle, you may proceed.

  4F
  --
A relatively simple one. Grab the ICE SHIELD to the NW, then enter the steps
just below (no, it's not over yet :P we can only wish...) It leads to a dead
end in 5F with a ICE LANCE. Not bad. Going back to 4F, follow the path to the
south... it leads you into the stairs to 5F, the RIGHT one :P. On the way, you
see two chests, with ICE GLOVES and ICE MAIL.

  5F
  --
Thank God. Only one path exists. Only one chest and it's right on the path.
Just follow the path (it's plagued by sharp ice so be careful) and pick up
the ICE BRAND and enter through the door for the second Gigas: the Ice
Gigas! Make sure you have your OgreKillers/Blood Swords ready again and
heal up/save.

_______________
BOSS: Ice Gigas
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 2000

  Just do what you did with the Fire Gigas again and you've solved him. Use
  Fire instead of Ice, of course. Blink and Shell is a good insurance policy
  against him. That's all. 

At this point, you must be very weary after all of those battles. This is the
half-way mark so don't think you're almost there. Go back and heal up, it's
going to be easier for your second run because you don't have to go out of the
way for items and the first two bosses are gone.

  6F
  --
Before taking the down road, hang a right to grab a easy one: POTION. Now, you
can go down the path you saw earlier. Make your way to the southwestern corner
and get the best staff you have seen yet, by far: SPELLBINDER. Take the south-
west-most door to find a room with the steps up to 7F.

  7F
  --
The floor has a few obstacles and you can just go directly up to find the door
to the next mage/boss. You could, but if you want the items, you'll have to
circle the room. To the east of the entrance: a puny SILK WEB. After that, go
to the northeastern corner for a HERMES. Go west, to the north portion, for
the last item: UNICORN HORN. That's all, just go to the NW corner and enter
the NW-most door.

*sigh* Yeah, another Gigas to kill. This time, it's even tougher and I mean
it. OgreKiller is a must here. HEAL YOUR PARTY TO THE MAX and MEMO SAVE! If
you're like me in my first run, you will die about 3 times... Hardest boss yet
due to the sheer power and the weariness the tower has caused.

___________________
BOSS: Thunder Gigas
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 2500

  Man, is he a m***********! Even my Gus with a OgreKiller, berserked and on
  the drugs (Aura) can only damage him 250 IF HE'S LUCKY! Most of time, you
  can only damage him for about 50 to 100. His attacks ranges from magic
  (Thunderbolt) to physical attack to Boulders. The most dangerous one would
  be either the lightning magic or his physical punch. Boulders are nothing,
  only 200 or so to one character. How to kill him? The art of reviving! He
  can only hit one character per turn and I used that to my advantage. I
  didn't even heal once, just revived. So... once he kills one of my 
  characters, somebody else revives him/her and resumes. The process goes and
  goes on until he dies or my MP runs out and I'll bet you $100 that he goes 
  down first. It's a good strategy... if you have enough MP left (well, I had
  Ethers to re-fill mine). Otherwise, just pummel him with your strongest
  attacks. If you have a strong Poison magic, use it, his only weakness is
  that. What else...? Shell and Blink can get you a fast start but it won't
  carry you far since this Gigas will punch you down fairly quickly. Good
  luck, little warrior.

Three down, one to go!

  8F
  --
Another easy one. The door to the stairs is on the third hall on the right.
Chests? Only one, and it's on the fourth hall to the right, the very last one,
in the back. It contains a FLAME SCROLL and is guarded by Gottos, a former
Commander. He's a blow-off despite his 2000 HP.

  9F
  --
The final actual floor!!! Aren't you excited! Pipe down! Go directly north for
a crappy HOURGLASS. Go to the southwestern corner for yet another sucky 
present: CROSS. Walk up to a flight of stairs to the next tier. You see a 
treasure chest waiting for you, tucked away in a corner... It's a BLACK ROBE,
but a 2500-HP monster guards it! So, save and heal. it's not that tough
as Thunder Gigas, which has the same amount of HP. It's a White Dragon... just
cast Shell and Berserk on your party and hack away. Please do cast Cure and
Life, it's going to be a long battle. Not hard, but long.

Go to the end of the path to find a quad set of doors. Take the second door
from the left to meet your buddy, Mindu!!!

  10F
  ---
Mindu greets you sheepishly and starts trying to break the seal to the Ultima
Scroll right away. After a few seconds of uber-1337 DBZ beams, the screen goes
white and the seal is broken! Sadly, Mindu has over-exerted himself and dies.
*sniff* That's the second 'fourth' character that has died! It's like bad 
luck... :P Anyway, fulfill Mindu's mission and enter the highly sought-after
room.

In the room, you see a yellow orb erected in the middle of the room. Yeah,
it's the Ultima Scroll, but don't go there yet... Look around the room and
you notice there's 4 more orbs... Go up to them and you will receive a stat
boost for one of your characters (random). It's not much, but it's better
than nothing. After getting them all, walk up to the incomparable Ultima
Scroll...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fynn Castle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sail back to Altair and you notice something different: it's destroyed! But by
what? Continue on northwards, toward Fynn. You also notice the enemies around
here suddenly gets harder, no more lame Bloodsuckers and such. Oh well. Looks
like Gatera is vanquished too... But Fynn isn't, YET! Whew! Go into the castle
to talk to Hilda. She will explain to you that a cyclone to the north has
destroyed the towns to the south and is coming for this very castle. I'm so
scared. Learn the term CYCLONE, but don't leave yet. Ask her about the Wind
Drake and she mentions something about the Mirror around here and its 
connection with the Pendant. Let's look for it!

Go to 1F and take the left hallway down to a set of stairs. Once in 3F, go on
the left narrow hall up to a room. That's the Mirror room that Hilda was
talking about. Not too hard, wasn't it? Go up to the mirror and use your
Pendant. The egg that you put into the spring appears within the mirror,
hatching! The Wind Drake has revived and rejoined with the Dragoons, its care-
takers. Yay! You get the item WIND DRAKE into your inventory. 

Go to the town to heal up and sell some stuff if you need. Buying some Ethers
could be a good idea, too. Go to Pavel's house and ask him about the Cyclone
and he feels that he needs to help you out. How do he do it? He'll point you
over to the wall by his bed. Go to his bed and walk into the eastern wall.
You've found a secret room, with 8 items: NINJA SUIT; THIEF'S GLOVES; ELIXIR;
SILVER PLATE; RUBY PLATE; GOLD PLATE; GOLD HAIRPIN, and BLOOD SWORD! Keep your
second Blood Sword, it's extremely useful against the final boss! Thanks,
Pavel!

Go back outside to have a sight at the Cyclone, which is really CLOSE to 
terminating its intended target, Fynn! Walk up to it and press X to bring the
Wind Drake out. He'll fly you up, into the eye. man, what a huge metropolis
the Emperor has right there!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Cyclone
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Ripper; Venom Axe; Diamond Gloves; Diamond Helm; Diamond Mail;
       Defender; Zephyr's Flute
Monsters: Bomb; Captain; Cockatrice; Evil Bud; General; Gottos; Hecteyes;
          Hill Gigas; Lamia; Mezzo Malboro; Royal Guard; Succubus; Wizard;
          Wood Golem

If you are using Ultima, to get it even stronger, you would seriously need to
bring more than a few Ethers with you. Wizards will occasionally suck your MP
out with Osmose while you're at it. The enemies here, however, are fairly easy
and straightforward. You've fought most of them before, so you should have no
trouble handling the difficulty of this temple.

  1F
  --
Two stairs here. You want the dead end first, to get the items, right? If so,
go to the upper right stairs, the first one you will see. It leads you up to
2F with a RIPPER. If you continue on the same path on 2F, you'll get on 3F
with some electrocuted floors (same as lava and bad water). Get across those
floors to get the best Axe yet: VENOM AXE. Go back to 1F and take the upper
left stairs.

  2F
  --
Bah. Onward!

  3F
  --
Another floor with an option. Both sets go up to 4F, but the first one you
will see leads to the upper portion, with two chests and a dead end. The
chests are stationed on the upper sides of the room, with the left being
a DIAMOND GLOVES. To the opposite side is a DIAMOND HELM (looks like the
Emperor has a girlfriend).

Back to the original level, just follow the path around to the next set.

  4F
  --
Go to the right to find ONE more fork. The stairs are literally right next to
each other, so which one to take? The left one goes to two chests and the
right one goes further up. If you took the left one, make sure you bypass the
electrical floor because there's NOTHING to see behind it all. Just go to the
south end and pick up the DEFENDER and Memo-Save because the next chest has a
tough squad of Generals, which attacks for a good number of damage and has 1800
HP. The reward: a DIAMOND MAIL.

  5F
  --
Only one path to take. Only one stairs to climb. Hello!

  6F
  --
Follow the hall to the right and up. You see a set of stairs and a chest right
next to it. Well, it's kinda like a trick. You savor the moment to see what's
inside, but why don't you do it the safe way? Heal up and save! Then you may
open the chest for a battle! Yes, I told you... it's with a 3000-HP Green
Dragon! Moo! If you have a Blood Sword handy, it will damage the Dragon for
about 1500 points, making this battle a cinch. Otherwise, use high-level Bolt
spells. I cast Shell, Haste, and Berserk on my party on the first turn and it
worked well. Good luck! Claim the ZEPHYR'S FLUTE afterwards.

  7F
  --
Yep, the final floor. Go up to the throne and heal/save. Time to battle the
Emperor himself! Is this the end?!?!

_____________
BOSS: Emperor
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1290

  He will summon two squads of his henchmen to fight you but kick their asses.
  If you can't finish the soldiers off, then you can't beat the Emperor 
  himself. As for the actual battle itself, it is extremely easy. Emperor has
  a Wood Golem and two Royal Guards to aid him in the battle but once you kill
  the Golem, it's over. Use your Blood Sword to take the Golem down quickly.
  After that, 2 or 3 hits will kill the Emperor! Yeah, he's THAT easy! You
  know what to do with the Royal Guards.

The slain villain flashes and vows that he will be back. You return to Fynn
automatically.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fynn Castle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hilda and Gordon congratulate you and throw everybody a party and dances!
When I first saw this, I was like O_O then o_O. They can't dance. After some
wacky stuff, a soldier comes slumping in, injured. He declares, in your face,
that Leon is the Emperor now! What a twist! But why do we have to fight more
and more? -_-;;

Talk to Hilda about your next destination and she suggests you go to the
Palamecia Castle but she doesn't know how to get into that barriered castle.
Ask Leila about the Castle and she recommends you to Pavel. 

Back in Pavel's house, if you ask Pavel about it, he won't know. Luckily, you
catch Cid in his house, right there. Talk to him and he will walk groggily to
the bed and asks you to take care of his child, the airship. Guess what? We
have one less person in this world. Curses! :P

Go back to your ship and go to the town of Poft to claim the airship. Hover
above the ground and head to the Palamecia, the place where you fought the
Behemoth and got tossed into prison. To the northern proximity of the 
Coliseum, there's a large factory-like complex stranded in the middle of
the mountain chain. Position yourself to the northern part so when you land,
you get on the upper part, to 7F.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Castle Palamecia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Diamond Plate; Garlic; Hourglass; Buckler; Thunder Spear; Slumber 
       Stalk; Saint's Spirit; Mage's Staff; Healing Staff; Spellbinder; 
       Sunblade; Hellfire; Zephyr's Flute; Elixir; Elixir; Elixir
Monsters: Black Knight; Captain; Cockatrice; Coeurl; Deathmask; Doom Petals; 
          Fallen Emperor; General; Gottos; Hecteyes; Killer Mantis; Lamia; 
          Lamia Queen; Stone Golem; Vampirette; Winged Ray; Wizard; Wood Golem

New monsters are aplenty here and they will introduce themselves with a good,
tough fight throughout. The enemies' HP got turned up by a notch, so be 
prepared to dish your best attacks often. You know the drill so I'll let you
go.

  7F
  --
Yep, you landed on the roof, therefore you're on 7F first. Follow the only
path you got to a room. Approach the crest on the wall and you will get on
a trap, causing you to fall down to 1F. Oh man... All of the way to 8F? Looks
like it.

  1F
  --
Go down for a quickie: DIAMOND PLATE. Go back up to the alcove you dropped in
and turn right. Skip the first path down, take the second one and enter the
first staircase for a small room in 2F with a HOURGLASS to pick up. Now, all
you got to do is to get the GARLIC in the lower left corner and enter the
second stairs.

  2F
  --
Go down first for a KNIFE, easy enough. Follow the only remaining path to
circle the floor to the next level. You can pick a BUCKLER up on the way.

  3F
  --
Ugh. Levels like this piss off easily, those damn developers just made those
levels to make the game longer. Let me explain: you start off in the middle,
you go to the northern passage... then you go left and down to the SW corner
for a THUNDER SPEAR (to add injury to insult, it's guarded by a Fallen 
Emperor!), then you have to walk all of the way over to the north and east 
then south to the stairs. Ugh, indeed.

  4F
  --
Take the obvious choice and get the chests to the south and east. After
picking a SLUMBER STALK and SAINT'S SPIRIT up, look to the southwest. There's
a door right over there. It leads to a room with three canes: MAGE'S STAFF;
HEALING STAFF (!!!); and SPELLBINDER. Only Healing Staff is worthy but it's
worth it anyway! ^_^ To get there, take the left path when you come upon a
fork to the north. To the right of that fork is the stairs. To where? Guess.

  5F
  --
No items here, for your information. Right out of the gate, you face two 
paths. To the left leads you up to 6F and a nice prize: SUNBLADE (guarded by
Lamias and Coeurls). Do go further, around the hall to another stairs. Follow
the path on 7F to a small door to a room with three ELIXIRS. 

  6F
  --
Not a problem. Just play the 'Follow the Leader'.

  7F
  --
Meh. Look above.

  8F
  --
The final one... When you see the steps up to the middle, ignore it and go
further left and up for two chests: ZEPHYR'S FLUTE and HELLFIRE. This is the
last chance to get those items and the previous ones since this goddamned
place is GOING DOWN! MUAHAHA! *Before you talk to Leon, de-equip any valuable
equipment that Gareth might have right now.* Go to the throne and have a 
serious man-to-man chat with Leon, your long-lost friend! 

Thought you'd have a nice reunion? Uh no, Leon is overcame with greed for
power. He thinks he is the Emperor, but after saying that, the REAL Emperor
comes back to life! (I guess he didn't like hell that whole much) Leon is
stunned with disbelief that he has been stripped away from his power. The 
Emperor starts to cast a magic that would eliminate every member of your party
before Gareth the Dragoon saves the day by sending the Wind Drake to pick you
up. However, he is to be not seen again... 

Back at the Fynn Castle, Hilda demands you to explain to her what's going on.
Firion does it, but vaguely. Leon has joined your party to aid you! All that
fourth-party-member swapping is making my dizzy.

                          CHAPTER 8 - PANDAEMONIUM!
                          =-----------------------=
                           -Enter the Jade Passage
                   -Receive powerful weapons in the Passage
                            -Survive Pandaemonium
                          -Triumph the final battle
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

So... here we are! The final run to finish it all, for once and for all. Of
course, you should train your characters, especially Leon, for a while. HP is
your main priority, with Magic levels as a distant second. You could beat the
entire game without having to use any magic except Cure and Life without any
serious trouble. Your party's HP should be at least 1500~2000. If everyone
(except Leon) is at least that, you should be able to beat the game. Just 
beat comfortably, not over-power though. 

Another thing: before heading for Pandaemonium, make sure you have about 15
to 20 Ethers if you're going to make one decisive run, no warping back to
heal at an Inn. This can be easily done, especially with that many Ethers or
Elixirs. Sell all of your unnecessary weapons/armor except the Blood Swords
and Healing Staff. Blood Swords are vital to your team's success in the final
dungeons. If you don't have those, then you must fight even harder to win it
all. 

Make sure, if you're gunning for 100% in Collections, that you search for 
missing monsters that might exist in the over-world. ITEMS, too. The list 
can be seen in the Config menu > Collections. Keep in mind that some of the 
monsters missing might be the ones in the final dungeons.

EXCALIBUR, you need to get this!!! I made this way so you couldn't miss this!
 ||
 ||
 ||
 \/
LOL. I have one MORE thing to write about: you should get the ultimate holy
sword EXCALIBUR before doing anything... You want it? Read on. Go to the
city of Deist and talk to the widow again. Ask her about the Dragoons. She
will give you the clan's treasured memoir: the EXCLAIBUR! Make good use of
it. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Castle Fynn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done with the item searching? Done with the monsters? Done with your HP train-
ing? Done with the Excalibur? Done with the crapping? Good. Go up to Hilda and
talk to her. She will tell you of a Jade Passage. Memorize the key term 
because she won't tell you much more. Ask Leila and Gordon about it and they
reveal a much clear insight about the passage. It's around Mysidia, by a sea
appropriately called Jade Sea. It's a passage to hell, so fittingly.

Get on your damn ship and head over to Mysidian area. On that continent, ride
the ship to the northeast corner. If you're looking at the map, you see a
small gap dividing the western continent (Mysidian) and the eastern. The gap
is kinda like a canal, an S-shaped one at that. The Jade Passage is on the
land that borders it, on the Mysidian side. Get over there!

Upon arrival, you realize that the passage resembles a lot like a lake. Land
on land and walk to...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Jade Passage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Hellfire; Diamond Mace; Hellfire; Notus; Cat Claw; Rune Axe; 
       Backstabber; Aegis Shield; Dragon Mail; Holy Lance; Yoichi's Bow; 
       Hi-Potion; Protect Ring; Hi-Potion
Monsters: Abyss Worm; Frost Lizard; Gazer; Great Malboro; Green Dragon; 
          Lifesucker; Maximus; Salamander; Scissorjaws; Succubus; White Dragon

As you can see above, the enemies here are spooking, tough, and powerful. 
Hell, even the White Dragon is a random enemy! There are indeed more Dragons
in that dungeon, but they are guardians for chests. So, I suggest you to take
your time and open all of the chests in one run and return to the overworld
and do your thing and come back and head for the stairs all of the way,
cutting the damage all of the way down. Sounds like a deal? ;-)

Here's a tip: Equip the Healing Staff on a character and heal whomever up
when they need it, it saves you a LOT of trouble and MP! Seriously!


  B1F
  ---
You game? OK! Follow the waters to the east to find a small niche with a
DIAMOND MACE. Go to the southwest to a corner with a HELLFIRE. You're done
with this level. Sadly, the monsters are not done with you. Fight your way
to the stairs to the southeast, through the door.

  B2F
  ---
Head up and down, ignoring the doors. Grab the HELLFIRE (NW corner) and the
NOTUS (in the middle, can't miss) before finding the third and final chest on
this level. DO NOT OPEN IT. Just wait. The chest contains a POWERFUL weapon,
CAT'S CLAWS, but because of its sheer power, it has to be guarded by a BLUE
DRAGON! To beat this 3500-HP titan, you got to have a Blood Sword or two
equipped. You can beat him if you don't have those anyway. Heal and save...
I'm not going to call him a boss because you fight White Dragons here and this
one is essentially similar to those so you know what to do. Good luck.

After the battle, follow the path to the east up to the northeast-most door.

  B3F
  ---
Only one path so take it, a swirling one with a ton of stairs going up and 
down. Ignore the doors until I say so. The paths are hidden behind the water-
falls (damages your party , tho, so be careful!) so don't think the paths ends
there! ^_^ When you see a chest... guess what? That's another guarded chest. 
The bastard? Mr. King Behemoth himself. Luckily, the 5000 HP goes down QUICKLY
because his stats are kinda shaky, not too powerful. He has no magic, he just 
attacks, allowing you to heal one person at a time instead of multiple ones. 
This guy is actually easier than the Blue Dragon so vanquish him to hell, 
where he belongs. Take the RUNE AXE and follow the path to the end, where 
there are three doors. Take the far one, the right one.

*NOTE: If you go into the waterfall in the last floor, you find a shopkeeper 
with Doom, Haste, Berserk, and Flare scrolls! Thanks a bunch, Mista Spinner!

  B4F
  ---
Immediately go up to find a chest with BACKSTABBER. Continue upwards to find
a door. Behind that one is three chests made for a Dragoon: (too bad he's 
gone) HOLY LANCE; AEGIS SHIELD; DRAGON MAIL. Holy Lance won't work well
because there's far more powerful weapons already in your inventory (well,
there should be!). In the mainland, go to the northeast corner to find the
final chest... guarded by another Dragon: the Red version. Heal and save.
What do I say? It's just another Dragon (5000 HP) so you know the drill by
now. Cast Ice spells, use Blood Swords, cast stat-enriching spells, etc. Make 
'im pay and get the YOICHI'S BOW. Go to the south and enter the SE door.

  B5F
  ---
Bah. The path here is singular and very narrow, you can't miss ANYTHING. Get
the HI-POTION, PROTECT RING, and HI-POTION en route to the eastern door.

  B6F
  ---
Oh la la... Get on the portal, duh!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNGEON: Pandaemonium
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Ether; Eye Drops; Genji Gloves; Genji Helm; Masamune; Ribbon; Genji
       Armor; Sage's Wisdom; Acid Bottle; Hellfire
Monsters: Barrel Worm; Blood Fiend; Blue Dragon; Bomb; Coeurl; Death Rider; 
          Evil Bud; Fenrir; Fire Gigas; Frost Lizard; Great Malboro; Ice 
          Gigas; King Behemoth; Lamia; Lamia Queen; Mantis Devil; Mythril 
          Golem; Red Dragon; Thunder Gigas

Now, this is the best time to warp back to some town and buy some Ethers/
Elixirs because you don't need your money anymore. You might have your
inventory near to full so you might have to sell some or use up some to make
some room for upcoming items. The monsters here ranges from the olden times
to the newer ones. Introducing Evil Bud, which you have fought so many times.
Introducing Red Dragon, which now appears here as a random enemy! Ha, scared
to even step one step?

  1F
  --
Bah. Bad opening display. The first floor has nothing except drawn-out path
to the next stairs. Never mind the holes in the base, it doesn't lead to any-
where. Yeah, I know, you get to fight so many tough enemies! Isn't it fun?

  2F
  --
After you go up the stairs, continue walking north to find an ETHER. Go down
the other stairs and follow it to the portal.

  3F
  --
First, go south to find one EYE DROPS. Go back to the original position and
take the northern path and go east. Make your way to the southeastern path,
where the next portal lies.

  4F
  --
*sigh* You have four doors to take, and all of them has something that would
undoubtedly aid you greatly in defeating the final boss. Let's start with the
left-most door, shall we? (You could skip them all and go to the second from
right door, the one that leads you further)

LEFT
----
Two great chests are found through this door. This is on 5F, BTW. Go under
various arches and stairs until you see a set of stairs RIGHT next to an arch.
Go up the stairs to find a room with a chest guarded by a Zombie Borghen. The
undead Borghen isn't even hard, it has only 2500 HP so I don't think you need
any help (just don't use the Blood Sword). Get the legendary GENJI GLOVES, the
first Genji of the trio. Before going down, go under the arch that's right 
next to a stair. Go under four more arches and you find a statue of some kind
of a cup. Go right and examine the bottom part of the eastern wall. You find a
hidden room! Inside is a chest with MASAMUNE, the MOST powerful sword, no
other sword comes close to out-powering it! Seriously! Go back to 4F.

SECOND FROM LEFT
----------------
Follow the choppy path to a chest. Heal and save, for there is a dangerous
test coming up. Open the chest to fight... the world's most famous 4-headed
freak, Tiamat! This guy is actually easy because he tends to cast magic, which
isn't as effective as the physical attacks. Destroy him with the Masamune,
Excalibur and Blood Swords. Grab the GENJI ARMOR and head to 4F again.

RIGHT
----- 
Yes, I skipped one but if I went there first, we would skip THIS one! Anyway,
follow the short path here to a chest. Guarded, you ask? Yep. Beelzebub is the
guy this time. He is a cinch if you have a Blood Sword (I know I say this
every time and it's annoying but it is THAT important.) because it hits for
2500 damage on this boss! (SEE?!?!) He has 5000 HP so you have 2 Blood Swords=
2 hit kill. Otherwise, keep your HP high with your healer's Healing Staff. He
usually casts Magic on a person, not the entire party. Not that hard at all.
The prize: Genji Helm.

SECOND FROM RIGHT
-----------------
Yep, this is it. Congrats to you if you've gotten all of the Genji and the
Masamune. With those, you're unstoppable! Follow the path to find one final
guarded chest... Yeah, seriously, this is the LAST guardian here! It's a
7000-HP gigas, Astaroth. If you can beat the previous guardians, you can
easily beat this one. Masamune does about 800 HP to her, X-Cal can do the
same. Blood Sword? Not as useful, but it's still good. She can suck some of
your HP to make it hers with its regular attack. Its magic is really, really
weak so don't make it a concern. Just heal when needed, as always and win! 
The RIBBON is yours... Continue walking the direction you were going and get
on the portal, finally!

  4F
  --
Back here, follow the L-shaped path to another portal, which takes you up 
to...

  7F
  --
Start walking to the west and grab the SAGE'S WISDOM, which is sitting a bit
to the north. Walk around the room to another portal.

  8F
  --
Oh well, you start in the southwestern corner and the other stuff here are
also in the corners so you have to travel great distances to get them all.
NW corner = ACID BOTTLE. SE corner = HELLFIRE. NE corner = portal to 9F.

  9F
  --
Nothing happening here, just a translation to 10F. Go down until you hit the
wall and walk left.

  10F
  ---
So.. what do I say? I mean, this is the last level. Think of the dungeons you
have endured... All of that is for this moment, to fight the final boss and
witness the ending. Heal your party to the MAX!!! Use everything you got to
heal up your HP _AND_ MP. Make final adjustments for your equipment or what-
ever. Here's my equipment for the characters, so you can compare yours to
mine, which PWNED the boss quite quickly.

Firion              Maria              Gus              Leon
------              -----              ---              ----
Masamune            Healing Staff      Rune Axe         Excalibur
Aegis Shield        Dragon Shield      Gold Shield      Blood Sword
Genji Helm          Ribbon             Ribbon           Diamond Helm
Dragon Mail         Diamond Plate      Genji Armor      Diamond Mail
Power Armlet        Genji Gloves       Protect Ring     Protect Ring

Notice that I divided the three Genji to three characters so they could be
balanced. Healing Staff may be questionable to you, but it's a quick way to
heal 1300+ HP to a character without any MP. I had only one Blood Sword but
if you have two, use it both!

If you have a memo save on 8F or nearby, leave it... If there's no memo file
then I guess you should save now. You can't go back to 9F from here so it's
not a good idea to save here if you have a file on the previous floors.

Walk up to the Emperor and make yourself heard!

_____________
BOSS: Emperor
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 10000

  Bah. 10000 HP goes down fast if you have Blood Sword. I mean, look at my
  battle record below. 'Nuff said. But if you don't have it... it's going to
  be a LONG battle. I've been there, my first run through this damn game. 
  The status-enriching spells are your best friends in this battle. Berserk,
  Haste, Shell, Aura, Blink, whatever. The boss has the Life-Absorb ability 
  endowed into him so it makes the battle a bit tougher. Sometimes the
  Emperor makes stupid decisions like casting Blind or Dispel when it doesn't
  matter so take advantage and show no mercy!


         Turn 1             Turn 2               Turn 3
         ------             ------               ------
Firion   Attack (300)       Attack (600)         Attack (550)
Maria    Haste              Attack (Maria-heal)  Ultima
Gus      Berserk            Attack (0!!!)        Attack (3)
Leon     Attack (3400)      Attack (3000)        Attack (5000!!!) KILL!
Emperor  Attack (900-Maria) Blind (Gus-miss)     Attack (Firion-900)

It's all done! Too easy, all thanks to the Blood Sword, the dirtiest secret of
FF2!!! *shrugs* See how many Attacks I did? It's all simple, not too many
plugs to push.


After the battle, the Emperor is overcame with shock and dies in horror. Enjoy
the ending, you get to see every fourth member in the game in this one!

The ending kinda sucks, by today's standards, though. Maybe we expected too
much, no? Make sure you save at the end, for the Collections record and the
Normal mode.

Very few, but they do deserve their own full section. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Ship Mini-Game

I'm sure you've heard about this already but if you haven't... I'm here for
you! Get on your Ship (the water one) and hold down the X Button. Still
holding the button down firmly, tap the Circle button 55 times. Play the Tile
Game! Not that hard at all, just practice. 

The record starts off at 3 minutes flat... If you get the 3rd place,
you get 2000 Gil. Get 2nd place, and 5000 Gil is yours. 1st place?
10000 Gil! Always remember what the best time is, so when you're
about to beat the game fast, you can finish no more than 2-3 seconds
faster than the best time.  This way, you get 10000 Gil and it's still
possible to beat the best time a lot of times before it gets
impossible.  Believe me, at the beginning of the game, you'll
appreciate all this money to buy the Mithril weapons and the
level 3-4 spells, especially if you're not playing the Easy mode.
A lot of Gold Needles as prizes is also very useful as they cost
a lot and you will need them soon.

(The above paragraph was written by ShiningV67! Kudos to him for doing all
of that! I <3 you, seroiusly!)

Also, if you make it under 6 minutes, you get a Potion. An Antidote and a
Potion are given to you if you make it under 4 minutes. As for 2 minutes,
you get a Gold Needle, an Antidote, and a Potion. (Pretty crappy, I know.)

--Hard-to-Find Monsters

Warmech: In the same room as the boss Tiamat, just walk around. There's a 
1/64 chance of meeting him but he's extremely powerful so level your party 
better be ready!!! 2000 HP is waiting for you! (I put down Kraken earlier, 
Brad Thibodeau pointed that out that it is in the Tiamat's floor. Thanks,
man!)

Tyrannosaur: Remember Lufenia? To the north of that town, there's a pond. Walk
around the pond and if you're lucky, you will fight this mofo. Not too tough
as Warmech. (1/62 chance)

Iron Golem: B4F of Temple of Chaos-Past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Best Weapons/Armor

WEAPONS
-------
Masamune- Simple: Go to the Temple of Chaos-Past. Go down to B4F. The chest
          to this greatest weapon is to the southeast.

Excalibur- In the Flying Fortress, get the Adamantite (2F). With that item,
           go back to Mt. Duergar and go to the north room for a blacksmith.
           He will form your Adamantite into Excalibur.

Thor's Hammer- Not powerful, but it's the best one for WW. Found in
               Tower of Mirage.

Cat Claws- For Ninja, RW and BW. Bought for 65,000 (Normal, 52000 on Easy) Gil
           in Gaia.

ARMOR
-----
Black/White Robe- Best ones for your WW and BW. Flying Fortress.

Dragon Mail- For your Knight, in Tower of Mirage.

Diamond Armlet- For everyone! However... only one: Sunken Shrine.

Protect Ring- Great for everyone... 2 in Flying Fortress, 1 in Temple of Chaos
              Past. You can buy this in Gaia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Unlimited Healing

Get two of those: the Healing Staff from the Citadel of Trials, and Healing 
Gloves (1 at Flying Fortress, 1 from Tower of Mirage). Now, do NOT equip them.
So whenever you need healing, you go to your items (preferably with your Mages
or Wizards) and use the Staff or Glove. Everyone in your party will be healed.
Repeat with one more guy and double healing! I went through the Temple of
Chaos-Past at level 30 WITHOUT using any magic for encounter battles with this
method!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Unlimited Bolt2/Fire2 magic

Good for Normal games, actually. Easy mode has too much MP... Anyway, get the
Gauntlets (Citadel of Trials) and Thor's Hammer (Tower of Mirage). Don't
equip them. Use them in battle and they will cast Bolt2. Nice...

As for Fire2, the Mage's Staff, from Sunken Shrine, does the job.

                        ------------------------------
==============================================================================

What collections? If you asked the preceding question, read on. If not, then
I assume you know... and skip this paragraph. Anyway, collections is a new
reward system that SquareEnix threw into this game (in Origins only). However,
if you want to view it in your game, you have to beat the game once and save.
Start a new game on that file and go directly to the main menu. Go under 
'Config' and select 'Collection'. There ya go, you're there. See the Monsters
and Items lists? You have to get all of the monsters and kill them to complete
the percentage on the Monsters list. As for the items, you have to collect 
every item that you have missed in your first run. If you got them all in the
first run, congrats! 

The rewards? Just some pictures of the characters in the game and some extra
endings. Yep, that's it. As I said before, you have to collect every item
from the chests and kill at least 1 of every monster to get all of the
rewards. However, if you want to view them all, you'll have to complete the
game AGAIN. Why? To see the endings! 

One more thing: to continue from your old file, just load your saved file from
the ending and you can start from there.

                       ------------------------------
==============================================================================

____________
BOSS:Garland (Temple of Chaos)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 106
EXP: 130

  Magic is ALMOST useless... except for Fire1. So cast Fire with your BM. For
  the rest of the classes, attack. WM or RM should heal every time the boss 
  attacks. Not too hard, but if you haven't trained up to level 3, you're in 
  trouble. Hell, with my Lv 3 Fighters (2), Lv 3 WM, and a Lv 2 BM, I beat 
  this creep in 2 rounds. TOO EASY.

___________
BOSS: Astos (Marsh Cave)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 168
EXP: 2250 (yay!!!)

  This boss is very strong and has a good-sized health points. This boss has
  a lethal spell: Reaper. This move = instant kill, so be very afraid! A good0
  way to win is with Haste (will only work if you're LVL 8). Have your RM or 
  BM cast Haste on your strongest fighters and pummel him with attacks. Your 
  RM or WM should heal EVERY time with Cure2. The boss has level 2 magic 
  spells so he will damage every member of your party. Strong, yes, but not
  tough. Fire2 or Bolt2 could easily damage him heavily (60 points!). Finish
  him off with attacks from your physical fighters.

  If you're having some trouble, you can clamp him down with Silence.

_____________
BOSS: Vampire (Terra Cavern)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 156
EXP: 1200

  So easy yet so tough to keep all of those alive. Well, not that hard. This
  boss has HIGH attack power so you better heal your party up if you want all
  of them alive. The HP is ridiculously low for a boss so it should be no 
  problem for you. Fire2 and Dia2 are the killer spells against him. Physical
  attacks also work wonders. I killed him with only 3 attacks: 2 Physical 
  Attacks and a Fire2. However, he killed my WM before I could kill him. Sad.


__________
BOSS: Lich (Terra Cavern)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 800
EXP: 2200

  As you can see, this boss has a LOT of HP. This boss also has level 2 Black
  Spells such as Ice2, Bolt2, Slow2, Sleep2, etc. They are very damaging, too,
  inflicting damage upwards to 150. Despite the size of the HP, you have to 
  make this battle swift. Don't heal too much, your WM have to use the Dia2
  spells, it works WONDERS on this boss, 150 easy damage points. Your 
  attackers should keep hitting on the boss, for maybe 50-60 points each 
  attack. Your BM should cast Haste because Lich as high defense against Magic
  so it's worthless to cast Magic. If you're having trouble... it could be a 
  good idea to cast NulIce or NulBolt to cease the heavy damage you receive
  from the magic. Don't stop pressing him with attacks and he should go down 
  within 5 rounds. Remember, try to maximize your attack options. If you have
  a Black Mage, cast Haste or Steel on your attackers... 


______________
BOSS: Marilith (Mount Gulg)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1200
EXP: 2475 (not bad...)

  The first thing... This boss is OBVIOUSLY a fire lover, since it is buried
  within the raging lava. What do you do? Cast Ice on him? Nope... Cast 
  NulFire, you fool! Along with your Flame Mail and Shield, you should be all
  right. After that, don't cast any Ice spells because she is not weak to 
  those spells... Just use your BM or RM to cast Haste or any status enriching
  spells to your attackers. After that, you may cast the magic to damage the
  boss. The healers should just keep watch and see if anyone need some help.
  Cure3 is always helpful! 

  You need some more tips? Shield2 is not a bad idea, considering that the 
  boss tends to attack more than cast magic. Level 3 spells are a very good
  alternative for your BM even though it may not damage Marilith a lot.

______________
BOSS: Evil Eye (Ice Cavern)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 162 (yes, 162!!!!!!!)
EXP: 3225 (For a 162-HP boss? Pretty good!)

  A very simple boss. SIMPLE. Just do 162 worth of damage and he's down. 
  Wait... there MUST be a catch in this! He can't be THAT easy! Well, there
  is a small catch... Doom. He knows THE nasty spell, Doom. It, if connected,
  will result in a fatal hit. Remember, he has only _162_ HP! Just attack 
  with everything you got and you're done!

  You wanna know how I beat the boss? Well... I commanded my two Fighters
  to Attack, my WM to cast Invis2 (just in case it makes the Doom attack miss)
  and make my BM cast Bolt3. My WM came out first and cast the seemingly
  worthless Invis2... Then my BM cast Bolt3 for 172 damage. Battle over. :) 

____________
BOSS: Kraken (Sunken Shrine)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 1600
EXP: 4245

  This battle is a VERY anti-climax one. While the boss is gigantic, the
  size of the HP is off the charts, and the strength of this boss is over-
  whelming, this one is simple to master. This boss has no magic other than
  Bolt2 to damage you so he depends on his brute strength to kill you. Now,
  to take away the 1600 HP he has, you use your attackers. With their pure 
  strength, they will damage him for about... 15 points. Yes, 15! It does make
  it even tougher, doesn't it? Well, no. If you've gotten the GIANT'S GLOVE
  earlier, you can master this battle without any trouble. The Giant's Glove
  heightens your attack power and it seems to 'remove' the defense of 
  Kraken's. Use this   glove as an item to boost your fighter (he must be 
  choosing it). After that,   boost your fighters even more with your BM/RM's 
  Haste. With those, your fighters can attack for upwards for 450 damage! Your
  WM/WW should cast physical barriers (Shld2 and Invis2). I have the entire
  step-by-step that I used to defeat this mother in the walkthrough if you
  want to see it.


____________
BOSS: Tiamat (Flying Fortress)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 2000
EXP: 5496

  A menacing boss and she look tough to slay... and she is! Especially with
  2000 HP... She throws a variety of attacks at you such as physical claw
  attacks, Thunderbolt, Toxin (VERY lethal!), and some other minor ones. Make
  sure your WW keeps your party's HP at the VERY HIGH levels! Toxin can throw
  your party off if you're not careful enough. As usual, your Knights/Ninjas
  should use the Giant's Glove and have your BW/RW cast Haste on them. With
  those, your Knights can attack for about 500 Damage! Pretty nice! Your WW
  and BW can barely scratch the boss so let them concentrate on the healing
  and the status boosters. Your WW could cast NulBolt to prevent the high
  damage from the Thunderbolt spell. After that, you could heal or cast Shld2
  to shut down the physical damage all of the way. Again, like Kraken, you 
  have to reply on your physical attackers to win this semi-tough battle.

  One more tip: Break can wipe her out in a single fierce blow. (Thanks, Red
  Scarlet.)


___________
BOSS: Chaos (Temple of Chaos-Past)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HP: 4000 (!!!)

  He has a lifetime's worth of HP AND he casts Cure4, which heals himself
  ALL OF THE WAY to the MAX, OFTEN! (Did all of that caps hurt you? too bad.)
  He has, like most of the bosses, has a high defense against magic so don't
  waste your Flare and Holy on him. Your WM should cast NulAll while your BM
  or RM casts Haste and Steel to your party. Your attackers MUST use the 
  Giant's Glove or you're going to have a tough time! 

  In other words, this is just another regular boss battle... it's just a
  prolonged one. Here's my battle report:

          Round 1         Round 2         Round 3         Round 4
          -------         -------         -------         -------
KN-Neo    Attack          Giant's Glove   Attack          Attack
KN-Fox    Giant's Glove   Attack          Attack          Attack
WW-Slut69 NulAll (Neo)    Shld2           Life 2 (Jesus)  NulAll (Jesus)
BW-Jesus  Haste (Neo)     Haste (Fox)     Dead            Steel
Chaos     Attack          Blaze           Tsunami         Tornado

          Round 5
          -------
KN-Neo    Attack          
KN-Fox    Attack (KILL!!!)
WW-Slut69 Cure4 (69)
BW-Jesus  Flare
Chaos     Attack

  That's about it. Luckily for me, Chaos never cast the ever-annoying Cure4
  so I was able to kill him quickly.

Before you read this seemingly pointless list, you have to know several 
things. After you beat the game, you can re-start the game with your saved 
file that you saved after the ending.  In that game, go to the Menu and go 
under 'Config'. On the end of the 'Config' menu, there's a new option:
Collections. You see four different options... the Bestairy is one of them.
This is directly linked to the rewards: Art Gallery and Endings. As you find
and capture new monsters, you get more and more pictures in the Art Gallery
and the Endings. Even if you get all monsters, you might not have all of the
rewards because the chests have to be opened too. 

That's why you need this list (not so pointless now, eh?) and I put down the
locations of every monster to help you find them if you never got them. Good
luck!

Dia4            45000     30000     Useless. Your WM needs to heal, not to
                                       damage. You will get Holy soon anyway.
Holy            60000     40000     The most powerful one.
NulAll          60000     40000     Not that useful as you might think, but
                                       get it anyway.

                        XIII. FINAL FANTASY II SECRETS
                       --------------------------------
==============================================================================

Again, not much, but where would I put them?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Concentration

Hold X and press Circle 15-20 when you have the Snowcraft. There are 32 boards
in all, so if you memorize the first board, skip the next 31 boards and you're
back at the original board! Beat that game (try for zero misses) and get an
easy prize! The prizes:

1st place: 40000 Gil, a Phoenix Down and an Elixir
2nd place: 12000 Gil, a Phoenix Down and a Cottage
3rd place: 3000 Gil, an Ether, and a Gold Needle
4th place: 1000 Gil, a Hi-Potion, and a Maiden Kiss
5th place: 300 Gil, a Hi-Potion, and an Antidote
Finishing: 100 Gil (woo-hoo!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Chocobo Forest

YEAH, the ultra-cute Chocobo is back! Well, not back, since this game was the
ONE that introduced the named beast! (Chocobos were at its peak in FF9 but
that's not the point) Chocobos, as expected, can transport you across land
with a greater speed. What's more... no random encounters while on it! You
want it even more, right? 

To get it, you have to advance the plot until you get the Canoe. Then go to
Poft and walk over the mountains to the east, to Bafsk. Continue walking to
the southeast, to Kai'son (or just take an air ride from Cid for 400 Gil).
Directly south of Kai'son is a small EMPTY patch in the middle of the forest.
Walk into the patch. Ta-da, the Chocobo Forest! 

Once in the Chocobo Forest, find the Chocobo and talk to it to mount. Now you
can walk to anywhere available faster! REMEMBER, once you dismount (X again),
the Chocobo will fly back to the Forest! You have to go back to the Forest
again to get it back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Normal Mode

Beat the Easy Mode and you have the NES format of FF2j! No, no, you won't see
Japanese text! It's just that you will play it in the same format. For 
example, you have to SELECT the enemies to attack. If you decide to make 
everybody attack on one of the enemies and it dies after the first attack,
the other guys will still attack at that space, missing (for sure!). 
Therefore, you have to PREDICT. Divide the attacks evenly or something. Same
thing with FF1 on NES. Dashing is gone here too. Map? Globe always.

Think this as a HardType of FF2, with the original game on FFO as EasyType.
For those who knows about FF4's Types, you should understand those. If 
not... I suggest you to research (on google or boards or whatever)!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Rare Enemies

I've seen some rare ones, but I cannot remember all of them. I'll try my best
to get them all, but PLEASE, PLEASE DO tell me about the ones that I might
have missed! Thanks!!!

GOBLIN PRINCE: Castle Kai'son
BLACK KNIGHT: A lot of those in Fynn before the rebel's victory.
SUCCUBUS: Jade Passage
PIT FIEND: Jade Passage
GAZER: Jade Passage (again!)
MANTIS DEVIL: Pandaemonium
GIGAN TOAD: Palamecia Desert
MAXMIUS: Jade Passage only
SCISSORSJAWS: Jade Passage only
MEZZO MALBORO: Found in Cyclone and Mysidian Tower only!!!
KING BEHEMOTH: Chest in Pandaemonium (4F?)
IRON GIANT: Very rare, only found on 5F or 6F of Pandaemonium. A lot of
            people have said that he is tough but I find him a pushover.
ZOMBIE BORGHEN/TIAMAT: Chests on 5F of Pandaemonium
BEELZEBUB/ASTAROTH: Chests on 6F of Pandaemonium

                      XIV. FINAL FANTASY II COLLECTIONS
                      ---------------------------------
==============================================================================

(from FF1 section)

What collections? If you asked the preceding question, read on. If not, then
I assume you know... and skip this paragraph. Anyway, collections is a new
reward system that SquareEnix threw into this game (in Origins only). However,
if you want to view it in your game, you have to beat the game once and save.
Start a new game on that file and go directly to the main menu. Go under 
'Config' and select 'Collection'. There ya go, you're there. See the Monsters
and Items lists? You have to get all of the monsters and kill them to complete
the percentage on the Monsters list. As for the items, you have to collect 
every item that you have missed in your first run. If you got them all in the
first run, congrats! 

The rewards? Just some pictures of the characters in the game and some extra
endings. Yep, that's it. As I said before, you have to collect every item
from the chests and kill at least 1 of every monster to get all of the
rewards. However, if you want to view them all, you'll have to complete the
game AGAIN. Why? To see the endings! 

One more thing: to continue from your old file, just load your saved file from
the ending and you can start from there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   MONSTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can check which monster you don't have here and highlight that one and
press CTRL + C, CTRL + F, then CTRL + V and Enter to find its monster listing
in my Bestiary to find its location. Pretty useful, eh?

list, guaranteed). All of the items are there, but some aren't in the same
part of the guide such as Castle Fynn. You get the Potions and the White Mask
at the different times. Remember that...

Swords           Attack +     Comments
------           --------     --------
Ancient Sword    25           Curse it its attack, pretty good for a while.
                                Found in Snow Cavern.
Blood Sword      0!           One of the best swords in the game, it sucks
                                the HP out of the target and makes it yours.
                                It is in Pavel's possession (Fynn), attained
                                before going into the Cyclone. There's one
                                more... in Fynn Castle (Underground)
Broadsword       8            A good starting weapon, found in many shops.
Defender         78           GREAT weapon! Your EVA goes up along with 78
                                points of attack power! Cyclone.
Excalibur        100          The legend. Before going to the Jade Passage,
                                talk to the woman in Castle Deist and ask her
                                about the Dragoons and she will give this up.
Flame Sword      63           Powerful stuff! Of course, it has the fire
                                element in it. Found in Mysidian Tower.
Ice Brand        72           Great one, with an ice element, of course. In
                                Mysidian Tower. 
Long Sword       13           Not a bad upgrade from Broadsword, also found in
                                shops.
Masamune         150          THE sword. Cuts through anything. In B4F of 
                                Pandaemonium, check my guide for more info.
Mythril Sword    20           An excellent one. In shops after you get the 
                                Mythril from the Snow Cavern.
Sunblade         83           Good against undead, found in Castle Palamecia.
Terra Sword      52           Not bad when you get it, in Leviathan.
Wing Blade       42           I LOVED this one! In shops and in Castle Deist.


Axes             Attack +     Comments
----             --------     --------
Axe              10           Meh. Gus starts with it, found in many stores.
Battle Axe       15           Shop for it.
Demon Axe        27           Decent! Also found shopping, I believe.
Mythril Axe      22           Buy one right after you get the Mythril!
Ogrekiller       58           Surprisingly powerful. Effective against Ogres,
                                as the name implies. Bought at Mysidia and
                                found at various places.
Rune Axe         95           The best Axe. B3F of Pandaemonium, guarded by a
                                King Behemoth. Worth it.
Venom Axe        76           Has the effect of Poison... A great alternative
                                of the Rune Axe. In Cyclone.


Bows             Attack +     Comments
----             --------     --------
Bow              1            LOL.
Flame Bow        42           Another Fire-based weapon. Found in stores and
                                Mysidian Tower.
Ice Bow          56           Ice-based, of course. Vastly better than the
                                Fire version. Shops has it along with the
                                Mysidian Tower.
Longbow          5            Buy this at once, anything's better than a Bow.
Mythril Bow      13           Meh. It's alright but not worth it, IMO.
Shade Bow        25           Useful at the time you pick it up in Dreadnought
                                but throw it away when you get the Ice Bow.
Yoichi's Bow     90           The best one. Somewhere in Jade Passage, a
                                Dragon guards it. If you use it in battle, it
                                will cast Berserk on the party. Nice!


Knives           Attack +     Comments
------           --------     --------
Cat Claws        86           First in the list and the best! It is guarded
                                in the Jade Passage. 
Dagger           7            I guess so, buy this and get rid of Knife.
Knife            3            Bah.
Main Gauche      32           Powerful and you get it early in the game, 
                                (Dreadnought) so keep it until you get the
                                Orichaldagger.
Mythril Knife    14           Maybe buy one, you get the Main Gauche early.
Orichaldagger    50           You get it too late but whatever. In Fynn, I
                                think.
Ripper           69           It's badass, gives you an extra attack if it
                                hits. In Cyclone but you would get the Cat
                                Claws shortly after.


Spears           Attack +     Comments
------           --------     --------
Demon Spear      42           It's alright... The shop in the Tropical Island
                                has it, I think.
Flame Lance      54           Good, but you get the Ice Lance, which is more
                                powerful in the same place (Mysidian Tower).
Holy Lance       90           UNGUARDED! Yay! In Jade Passage, this one packs
                                a whoop.
Ice Lance        66           It's a good one, but you get ANOTHER one in the
                                 Mysidian Tower: the Thunder Spear! HA!
Javelin          6            Heehee. Such a weakling.
Mythril Spear    18           Not bad. Buy one.
Spear            11           Well, better than a javelin, I guess.
Thunder Spear    78           The best spear you can find in Mysidian Tower.
Trident          30           A good jump from the Mythril version... Buy this
                                 one in a shop.


Staves           Attack +     Comments
------           --------     --------
Diamond Mace     90           Yep, the best thing here. In Jade Passage.
Healing Staff    78           This RULES! Use it to HEAL your party not damage
                                the baddies! Except if they're undead! In
                                Castle Palamecia.
Mace             9            Buy one to shun off the Staff.
Mage's Staff     40           Nice one, found in Desit Cavern and Palamecia.
Mythril Mace     16           It's alright... I recommend you try some other
                                weapons at that time (after the Mythril part).
Power Staff      53           Powerful stuff. Want this one? In Mysidian Cave.
Spellbinder      64           Venom is stored within this one, pretty cool. If
                                you USE it as an item in battle, it will cast
                                Venom 16. Found in Castle Palamecia.
Staff            4            The primitive. Hah.
Werebane         28           Funny, I thought this was a SWORD! Heh. It's
                                effective against anything that starts with
                                Were. Can be bought.

Shields          Blocks    Defense Rate   Comments
-------          ------    ------------   --------
Aegis Shield     6         10 percent     The best one... No Genji here. This
                                            one is the only one that can block
                                            special attacks. In Jade Passage.
Bronze Shield    2         5 percent      Decent, but you can get Mythril
                                            Shield shortly after.
Buckler          1         4 percent      Bah.
Diamond Shield   4         7 percent      Resistant to Bolt, very decent. No
                                            complaints here.
Dragon Shield    5         9 percent      Second to Aegis. I'm not sure where
                                            you get this, tho. If you recall,
                                            please tell me, I'll credit you!
Flame Shield     4         7 percent      Another decent one. Mysidian Tower.
Gold Shield      4         7 percent      You get this pretty early, in Castle
                                            Kai'son! Also can be bought.

 that amount, it can't block anymore in that battle. The Defense Rate is the
 percentage/chance that the shield would block the attack.

Body Armor       Defense +     Comments
----------       ---------     --------
Black Robe       35            INT +10 and +5 more DEF than White Robe. Also
                                 in Mysidian Tower.
Bronze Mail      5             Same as Copper Plate, but heavier.
Copper Plate     5             Okay... Not a big jump from Leather Armor but
                                 whatever.
Diamond Mail     43            Resistant to Thunder. In Cyclone.

                                 Palamecia.

                                 Awesome! IN the same room as the Holy Lance,
                                 in Jade Passage.
Flame Mail       29            Resistant to Fire, of course. Mysidian Tower.
Genji Armor      75            Genji is always the best... In Pandaemonium,
                                 guarded by Tiamat.
Gold Plate       22            El cheapo for a +22 armor! 
Golden Mail      15            It's GOLD, but only +15? HA! Resistant to
                                 poison, though. Don't buy this, just find it
                                 in various dungeons instead, to save money.
Ice Mail         36            Resistiant to Ice. Another Mysidian Tower item.
Knight's Armor   22            This one sucked in FF1 but it's okay here. A 
                                 tad too expensive so get it in Deist Cavern
                                 for free.
Leather Armor    2             Minimal increase from Shirt but that's all you
                                 got in the start.
Mythril Mail     10            Gah, more expensive than the Silver Plate,
                                 which has the same DEF amount. Weight doesn't
                                 do much. (this one is heavier)
Ninja Suit       40            AGL +10! w00t! This must-have item is in
                                 Mysidian Cave.
Power Sash       25            STR +10! Awesome stuff. In Leviathan.
Ruby Plate       15            Nothing special, just a +15 Armor. In Fynn.
Silver Plate     10            Buy this one rather than Mythril Mail.

                                 Borghen.
Ice Gloves       20            Resistant to Fire. Found in Mysidian Tower
                                 along with all that Fire/Ice/Thunder things.
Leather Gloves   1             o_O
Mythril Gloves   6             It's alright, buy several once it releases.

                                 STR by 10! Only one... Leviathan. :(
Protect Ring     18            Can't get KO automatically (Death, etc.) Not
                                 as useful as you would think so... In Jade
                                 Passage, only one...
Thief's Gloves   15            VERY useful at the time you pick this up. AGL

Titan's Gloves   15            This, too! STR goes up by 10. Thief's Gloves 
                                 and Titan's are both great.


Head Armor       Defense +     Comments
----------       ---------     --------
Bronze Helm      2             Meh.
Diamond Helm     17            Only 17, but it's next to the best, Genji. It's
                                 Diamond so it's resistant to Thunder. Found
                                 in Cyclone.
Flame Helm       13            Resistant to Ice... Mysidian Tower.
Genji Helm       30            As expected, it is the best. Pandaemonium...

Gold Hairpin     11            Resistant to Thunder... Bah. In Mysidian Cave,
                                 and in Pavel's possession.
Headband         12            Strangely enough, this one adds 2 to your STR.
                                 In Leviathan.
Mythril Helm     4             Gah. Buy this if you wish.
Ribbon           10            Protects you from some special attacks but it's
                                 not that good. If you're low on money, sell 
                                 this, it rakes you some good money. Only one:
                                 Pandaemonium. (Astaroth!)
Titan's Helm     6             STR +10! Buy, buy, buy!

                        XVIII. FINAL FANTASY II MAGIC
                       -------------------------------
==============================================================================
ALL magic can reach to Level 16 as its maximum level possible. ALL. What 
does leveling up has in effect? It makes the spell more easier to hit or
connect; more powerful; more useful; increased in the function. Common sense.

Also, most of the spells can be bought at Mysidia but I won't put them down
unless its the only one to buy it. If it can't be bought (None), then it has
to be found as a chest discovery item. Keep your eyes open!
