1. Introduction
---------------

Hi, people.

For your information, this is not exactly a true non-spoiler walkthrough. It
is more like a quick guide through the game. Most people who come to FAQs that
we FAQers make only need that ONE tidbit of information and that's it. They
will never use that walkthrough again, ever. Yet they have to go through 300+
KB guides (like mine! ^_^ I'm guilty, yay) and find that damn thing, cramped
within a 300+ pound haystack. Therefore, I will still state the names, the
key terms, the bosses, the places, you name it like it is a regular walk-
through.  If you're one of those people, I think you will find this guide 
VERY helpful! BUT I won't tell you what levels/HP you should be/have. The 
games aren't even that hard so no worries. Shopping are your problem too.

A few tips in using this guide: Know which place you just was in and skim to
that position and you should know what to do! Use the items I submitted as a
checklist, so you won't miss anything. That items thing is for the players who
want 100% in their Collections, so they know they have found every item in 
that castle/dungeon/floor and move on. Also, I will NOT tell you when you
should heal or go back to heal, that's your problem so you figure it out.

As for Final Fantasy II, I have added a few 'checkpoints' (should be obvious
to you) around so you can detect where in the guide you're looking at. FF2
has a LOT of encounters with Altair and Fynn Castle that you could be confused
where you're at. FF1 doesn't have that problem so it doesn't need those. 

REMEMBER: you figure out when to heal/save by yourself. This is a HELPING
HAND, not a BABY-SITTER.

This is Fox, over and out.
