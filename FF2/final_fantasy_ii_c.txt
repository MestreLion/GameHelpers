I.) GAME BASICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.) Game Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Fantasy II was made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
The available buttons are A,B, Select, Start, and the control pad (up,
down, left, right). A: On the field, it will search the square you are
facing. In battle and in the menu, it confirms a selection. B: Cancels any
selected action, closes windows. Start: Opens the menu on the map or in
the field, pauses in battle Select: In the field or on the map, allows you
to change the positions of your characters. B and Select: Opens the World
Map (must have the Ring item first).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.) The Menu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By hitting start on the map or in the field, you'll open up the menu
screen. There are several sub-sections of the menu: Item, Magic, Equip,
Stats, and Save.

1.) Item: Allows you to use the items that you've acquired. Note that some
items can't be used in the field.

2.) Magic: Allows you to use the magic that you've acquired. Note that
some items can't be used in the field.

3.) Equip: Allows you to equip weapons, shields, armor, helms, gauntlets,
and items. You can only equip two items at a time.

4.) Stats: Allows you to view the statistics of your characters: Agl, Hit
Points, Int, Magic Points, M. Pwr, Pwr, Soul, Vit, Weapon Skill, Att, Def,
Hit%, Evad, and M. Def.

5.) Save: Allows you to save your game.  This can only be used on the
world map. You can have a max of four saved games.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.) Battle System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battles in FFII are turn based.  As the battle opens, you'll have four
options: Attack, Run, Magic, and Item.  If you choose to attack, then you
choose a target that the character will attack.  If you choose to run, the
character will try to run (could you guess?).  If you choose to use Magic,
you'll have to choose a spell and a target.  Note that you can select all
foes and all of the party. Finally, if you choose to use an item, you can
use your two items and whatever is equipped in your right and left hands.
Pretty simple, eh?  The game ends when all of your party is dead or
petrified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.) Status Ailments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) These Status Ailments last even after Battle is finished.

Poison: At the end of each turn in battle or with each step on the map, a
poisoned character will lose HP.  Cure it with an Antidote or the spell
Heal (Lv.1).

Dark: Darkness lowers hit percentage, causing complete misses or just a
lower number of hits.  Cure it with an EyeDrop or the spell Heal (Lv.1).

Curs: Curse lowers attack and defense. Cure it with a Crucifix or the
spell Heal (Lv.2).

Dumb: Dumbfounded prohibits spell casting.  Cure it with an EchoScn or the
spell Heal (Lv.3).

Frog: Frog lowers attack and defense and prevents you from using magic or
items. Cure it with a MaidKiss or the spell Heal (Lv.4).

Ston: Stone prohibits action.  Cure it with a G. Needle or the spell Heal
(Lv.5).

Dead: Death prohibits action.  Cure it with a FenixDn, at a Shrine, or
with the spell Heal (Lv.6).

2.) Battle only Status Ailments
These Status Ailments are cured after battle or randomly during the
battle.

Conf: Confusions causes you to lose control of your characters actions.
The character will act randomly.

Hold: Paralysis prohibits action.

Mini: Mini lowers attack and defense.

Mute: Silence prevents spell casting.

Sleep: Sleep prevents action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.) Building Your Characters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Fantasy II was the debut of a new status system.  There are no
levels; characters progress in ways reflecting their actions in battle.
For example, if Frioniel attacks 100 times, he'll gain a weapon skill
level, allowing him to hit 1 more time in battle.  If he casts a spell 100
times, he'll gain a magic skill level, improving the effectiveness of the
spell. If he loses over half his HP, he'll gain more HP; the same goes
with MP. In this fashion, characters are built up.  See the Tricks section
for some tricks on how to gain statistics faster and the Statistics
section for more info.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.) Rows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In FFII, there are two rows: the front row and the back row.  Characters
in The back row can only be hit by magic attacks (unless everyone in the
front row is dead).  The same goes for enemies.

=========================================================================
II.) WALKTHROUGH
=========================================================================
CHAPTER I: THE REBELLION'S NEW HOPE
=========================================================================
A.) Altea
Enemies: DkKnight, LegEater, Hornet, Goblin
Treasures: Potion
Boss: None
=========================================================================
You'll be given the chance to name four characters.  There is no default
option, but the names are, in the order that you'll name them, Frioniel,
Leonheart, Maria, and Guy.  As the game starts, you are immediately thrown
into a fight against 4 DkKnights. Your party will be wasted quickly, so
don't even try to put up a fight. Frioniel will awake in Altea after a
short dialogue between Hilda, the Princess of Phin, and Ming-Wu, Phin's White
Mage.  Apparently, your group was escaping Phin as the Paramekian empire
was invading it. You were ambushed on your way out. Once Frioniel awakes,
he steps outside and re-unites with Guy and Maria. Leonheart has yet to be
found, unfortunately. Your party then seeks audience with the Princess.
Listen to her speech, then learn the password Wild Rose. Repeat it back
to her and she will suggest that you search for Leonheart in Phin.

You're now free to head for Phin, but I suggest talking to the townsfolk
and rebels to learn what's going on. After talking to the King, who's
wounded, head down the stairs and grab the Potion. Be sure to talk with
Paul, Gordon, and Tobul (disguised as the old man in the weapons shop).
Now, head for the armor shop and buy a Buckler, three Leather Gauntlets,
and two Leather Helmets.  Give Guy a Leather Helmet, Buckler, and Leather
Gauntlet. Give your other Leather Helm to Frioniel, and give him a Leather
Gauntlet too. Maria has to get stuck with the leftovers, no Helmet for her
just yet=). Hit select and move Maria to the back row. You should have
some gil left, but not enough to buy anything. It's time to earn some
cash, and gain some skill levels while you're at it.

After exiting the town, wander around, butchering the Hornets,
LegEaters, and Goblins that attack you.  Right now, your hit% is
probably terrible; well, it is terrible. This goes especially for the
Bow, which is not only weak, but pretty innacurate.  Although many
players choose to equip Maria with Canes, Knifes, or Javelins rather
than Bows, I believe that Bows are the best of the choices.  Although
finding a 'good' bow will take a while, once you get one, you'll see the
bonus of being be able to attack forcefully and not fear retaliation.
Canes are typically good for their 'as item' powers, which can be used
whether the item is equipped or not.


I would recommend building Frioniel's Sword and Shield skill level to at
least level 4.  Also do this for Maria's Bow level.  This will prove
very useful, and give you an extra edge in the beginning.  Once you get
the money, buy Maria a Cure Spell and a Leather Helmet.  Once that's
finished, head north to Gatea. At Gatea, you'll want to purchase the
Leather Armor for Maria, at a rather hefty price of 100 gil. It's worth
it, though.  Now, head for Phin, a bit north of Gatea (across the lake).

=========================================================================
B.) Phin
Enemies: Captain, LegEater, Hornet, Goblin
Treasures: Potionx3, Ring
Boss: None
=========================================================================

In Phin, take care to avoid the "citizens."  They are really soldiers of
the empire that will decimate your party mercilessly.  Instead, walk north
and go one pace further than the wall.  Move east, then south, around the
wall, and enter the pub.  In the pub, go talk to the bar tender.  Say
Wild Rose, and he'll tell you that Scott, Prince of Kashuon, is dying.
Follow the secret passage to Scott's bed, and talk to him.  Say White
Rose, and Scott will give you a Ring.  He wants you to tell his brother,
Gordon, to have pride in his abilities.  He also wishes you to inform the
King that Phin was only captured because Duke Borgan betrayed the rebels,
and is now an Imperial General (you'll cross swords with him soon enough).
Scott then perishes, after mentioning Hilda.

Take the Ring, and open the three treasure chests for Potions. Head back
to Altea. Show the Ring to Gordon on your way to the Hideout (not
needed, but improves the story a little). Inside, talk to Hilda. She'll
beg you to find the legendary Mithril, thus allowing the Rebels to be
better equipped.  Learn the keyword Mithril, and repeat it to her.
She'll now mention the Warship, a terrifying Imperial weapon that's
being built in Bofsk.  Learn Warship, and recite it back to her.  She'll
tell you that it's even better than Cid's Airship.  Cid, by the way, was
the Captain of Phin's White Knights, and is now a transport pilot.  Ming-Wu
says he'll accompany you on your quest for Mithril, and brings along his
Canoe. Talk to the rebels; one of them will tell you that Josef in
Salamando may know the whereabouts of the Mithril.  Talk to the King,
and he'll issue a death sentence on Borgan (right, like he has any power
anyway). Now, you can head for Palm, a town northeast of Altea, by means
of Canoe, but you should wait.  Before you leave, you might want to buy
Fire, Ice, and Bolt for Maria and Ice, Bolt, and Cure for Guy.  This
will cost you 2400 gil, so be patient->It's worth it. Also, give Ming-Wu's
Copper Armor to Frioniel, and give Frioniel's Leather Armor to Ming-Wu.

Now that you have Ming-Wu, you might stand a chance against Mysidian enemies.
If you have a reasonably strong Bolt and Fire spells and reasonably high
HP, walk around on the tip of the peninsula south of Altea.  The enemies
here are from later in the game.  If you're lucky, you'll run into Mallows
and Puddings.  Use the select-cancel trick (see secrets section B) here,
and when you're done, blast the Mallows with Bolt and Puddings with Fire.
Use Ming-Wu to Safe and Cure the party.

=========================================================================
C.) The Mithril Mine
Enemies: Soldier, Goblin, G.Goblin, Balloon, Slime, Zombie, LandTrtl
Treasures: Potionx2, EyeDrop, 261 Gil, Fire, Exit, Mithril
Boss: Sargeant
=========================================================================

Once you have the Canoe, you're free to row northeast from Altea and
follow the short trail to Palm, a small town.  There's nothing of real
worth in Palm as of yet, though there is some new armor.  If you want, get
a Copper Gauntlet for Guy and Maria.  Talk to the pirate near the entrance
and he'll take you to Poft for a small price of 32 Gil.  Poft doesn't
offer much in terms of weaponry or armor either, but it does have an
airship service.  In the pub, talk to Cid's attendant, she'll offer to fly
you to various locations: Bofsk, Salamando, Semite, and Kashuon.  Since
you may be making some hefty purchases, I suggest walking east of Poft to
Bofsk, rather than flying there. On a side note, mention the Warship to
Cid to get his "professional" opinion on the craft.

Bofsk has been occupied by the Empire (it's teeming with Imperial
soldiers) and its citizens are being forced to construct the mighty
Warship (that huge thing in the valley northwest of Bofsk). The commander
standing in the middle of the town is the Dark Knight, a new villain hired
by the Empire to oversee the Warship's construction. In the southwest
corner is an Imperial commander that's actually a spy, but he can't help
you since the Dark Knight is present.  Go to the armory and buy Silver
Armor for Frioniel, Maria, and Guy. Give the Copper Armor back to Ming-Wu, and
sell the Leather Armor.  The Bronze equipment isn't worth the gil it
costs, mainly because the defense boost is paltry.

Head back to Poft, and this time go northwest to Salamando.  This town has
also been occupied by the empire; much of the population has been forced
to mine Mithril in the cave behind Semite Falls (The Mithril you want is
there).  You can talk to Josef in the northeast house, who asks you if you
are Imperial spies (really, who would admit to being a spy?). Ask him
about the Warship and Airship and he will pass you off for fools. Ask him
about the Mithril and he'll tell you that it's being mined in the cave
behind Semite Falls. Say Wild Rose to him and he'll poke fun at the
rebels for getting kids to do their work.  Once you're done interrogating
Josef, go to the Weapon's Shop and buy a Long Sword for Frioniel and a Long
Bow for Maria.  Sell the Broad Sword and Bow. Buy the Battle Axe for Guy,
and give his old Axe to Ming-Wu. Sell the Cane. Rest at the inn, if you need
it, and then head out west until you reach a river/lake, and then paddle
your way to the small cave.  Save, and enter the Semite Cave.

Get the treasure in the northwest for 10 gil, then head to the southeast
for 200 gil.  Head west to the stairwell (southwest corner). On the
second floor, get the EyeDrop from the northwest treasure, then head up
the north path for a Potion.  Grab the second Potion from the southeast
and head the easternmost of three doors. You can go south for a 1 gil
fortune, then head east for 50 gil (that's more like it).  Take the
easternmost door to enter a room full of miners, including Paul. Nellie,
standing next to Paul, is Josef's daughter. She's a hostage of the
Empire. Talk to Paul and he'll agree to free the slaves and return to
Salamando. However, he informs you that he, a master thief, could not
find the Mithril. Head east to the staircase. On the fourth floor, be
sure to get the spell Fire from the north treasure chest. Give it to
Guy.  The exit is in the southeast.  If you happen to run into Slimes in
this area, blast them with Maria's Ice Spell for a quick
victory...physical attacks are useless (just as they were on Mallows and
Puddings, the big brothers of Slimes, which you may have fought south of
Altea). On the fifth floor, head past the door to the northeast corner.
Open the treasure chest to get the Exit spell. However, LandTrtl shows
up to reclaim what's his. He has 140 hp, and is weak to Ice.  Have
Frioniel attack, have Maria cast Ice, Guy cast Ice (if he doesn't have
it, attack), and have Ming-Wu cast Safe on the party. If anyone is badly
hurt, have Ming-Wu heal them.  The LandTrtl should die quickly. Give Exit
to Maria. Now return to the door and head inside.  Heal up, then talk to
the Imperial Sargeant guarding the Mithril.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sargeant
Hp: 140 Mp: 5
Weakness: None
Reward: 200 Gil, Mithril Axe, Mithril Helm, Mithril Armor, Mithril Bow
Attacks: Bow3, Physical Attack
Strategy: Have Frioniel and Guy attack.  Maria should either cast Ice or
Fire, whichever is at a higher level.  Ming-Wu should first Safe the party,
then cast Dispel. From there, he can attack and cure when necessary.
Although the Sargeant is pretty tough, he'll go down soon if you cure
weaker character.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note: The Sargeant doesn't always drop the Mithril equipment.*

Grab the Mithril, then cast Exit.  Cure Maria (as Exit drains hp).  Save,
and head back to Salamando.  There, Josef will give you information about
the Warship and Airship.  Head back to Altea via Poft and Palm.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER II: THE WARSHIP
=========================================================================
A.) Bofsk
Enemies: Soldiers, G.Goblins, LegEaters, VmpThorns, Balloon
Treasures: Long Sword, Long Bow, Pass
Boss: None
=========================================================================

In Altea, show the Mithril to Gordon (not necessary, but if you like to
see him belittle his own worth=)).  Head upstairs and show it to Hilda,
who will tell you to take it to Tobul immediately.  So, head for the
weapons shop and give the Mithril to the Old Man.  Now the Altean Weapon
and Armor shops carry Mithril equipment, a lot more powerful than the
previous armor and weapons. Definitely get the Mithril Sword and Shield
for Frioniel.  You also want to get the Mithril Axe (if you don't have it)
and Mithril Shield for Guy.  Everyone (but Ming-Wu) should get a nifty
Mithril Helm.  If you have enough cash, get Mithril Gauntlets for Frioniel,
Guy, and Maria.  If you want, give the Battle Axe to Ming-Wu, and sell the
Axe.  Head back to Hilda. She'll tell you that the Dark Knight was called
back to Paramekia on assignment, so Borgan was placed in control at Bofsk.
Borgan's security is lax, and Hilda believes that her spies can now help
you sabotage the Warship. Basically, you're to go to Bofsk and either
destroy the Warship or delay its construction.

Head to Palm (buy the Mithril Bow here if you don't have it!), then Poft,
and then walk (or fly) to Bofsk. At Bofsk, you're now free to talk with
the townspeople.  You'll learn that you need a Pass to board the Warship,
which is surely going to attack Palm, Poft, and Altea.  You'll also learn
that Borgan is a corrupt moron. With that in mind, talk to the spy in the
southwest corner of town.  Tell him "Wild Rose" and he'll tell you to
reach the Warship via the sewers. So head for the sewers, which are
accessed by the little stairs. Take the left path to grab a Long Sword
(not good at this point, but you can sell it for cash). Follow the
straight forward path, grabbing the Long Bow in the southwest. The stairs
are in the southeast. The second floor is even more simple than the
first=).  Take the right path and follow it until you reach...the Dark
Knight!? Apparently, he would never leave until his work was done.  He
informs you that the Rebellion will be crushed by the completed Warship.
He then departs, followed by Borgan, who calls you a "spoony guy."  You
automatically follow them outside and watch the Warship take off. Quickly
go back inside the Sewers and head east.  Take the door, grab the Pass and
step onto the pentagram.  You'll find yourself standing outside of Bofsk.
Head back inside to sell your Long Sword and Bow. Also, talk to the
townspeople for some information on the towns attacked.

When you're ready, head to Poft. You should notice that half the people
of Poft were killed in the attack. Head to the Pub and talk to Cid.  Ask
him about the "Airship."  He'll tell you that it runs off the "Sun
Flame." The Sun Flame?  Ask him about the Sun Flame, and he'll tell you
that enough Sun Flame in an engine will cause an explosion (Guess how
the Warship will be destroyed). Hitch a boat ride back to Palm. Lots of
people died here too, including the "sleaze" that was hitting on Maria.
The Empire must pay... Head to Altea, and go to the hideout.  Most of
the refugees fled there after the Warship's attacsk.  Un-equip Ming-Wu,
then talk to Hilda. Ming-Wu will leave the party and will try to help the
King. Hilda will beg you to find a way to destroy the Warship.  Ask her
about the Sun Flame.  She'll say that its on the first floor of Kashuon,
and you'll tell her that it can be used to destroy the Warship.  So, you
need to get the Sun Flame. But to open the gates of Kashuon, you'll need
the Goddess Bell, hidden somewhere to the north.  Go talk to Ming-Wu, and
ask him about the Sun Flame. He'll mention the Fire Festival of Kashuon,
and that you must get the EgilTorch to carry the Sun Flame.  Now, ask
the King about the Sun Flame. Finally, he'll mention the Goddess Bell
(and you can actually learn the keyword this time!!!). Learn it, and say
it back to him, Ming-Wu, and Hilda. Hilda will tell you that Josef in
Salamando may know the whereabouts of this bell.  Guess where you're
going next?

=========================================================================
B.) The Snow Cave
Enemies: Snowman, Icicle, Ghoul, Zombie, Shadow, DeathHead, DualHead,
Grenade, G.Goblin, Goblin, Balloon
Treasures: IceSled, 250 gil, Battle Axe, Antidote, Mithril Cane, Ice Wind,
Potionx2, Ice, Mithril Lance, Ancient Sword, Silver Armor, Goddess Bell
Bosses: Adamanti, Borgan
=========================================================================

Head back to Salamando and talk to Josef.  He'll join your party if you
mention the Goddess Bell to him.  He'll also tell you that the only way to
get onto to Snow Field is by using the Ice Sled, which Josef hid in the
Semite Cave. Head for the Semite Cave and go to the Ice Block on the first
floor.  Check the corner to the northeast of the ice block and you'll get
the Ice Sled. Head for the Snow Field entrance northwest of Salamando and
head east until you reach the Snow Cave.  On the first floor, grab the
northwest chest for 100 gil and the southeastern one for 150 gil.  The
exit is straightforward and easy to find. The second level has no
treasure, so take the stairs.  From the entrance of the third floor, head
northwest for an IceWind.  Take the northeast stairs to enter a treasure
room.  Grab the Battle Axe (southeast), Antidote (center), and Mithril
Cane (northwest). The Mithril Cane is guarded by Grenades (4-5) who are
easily defeated by physical attacks.  Head back to the main room of the
third floor. The exit of the third floor is in the southwest corner. Take
the Potion in the northwest and head east to get Ice. You can get another
Potion in the south-center. Finally, grab the Mithril Javelin from the
southeast corner.  The fifth floor is also easily tractable, be sure to
get the Ancient Sword (guarded by a Shadow and two Ghouls) in the
southwest corner of the room and the Mithril Shield in the northwest. The
Ancient Sword has terrible accuracy, I personally didn't equip it over the
Mithril Sword.  Still, the weapon sells for a good price.

Take the southeastern door to enter a lake-like area.  You can try to
talk to the wandering beavers, but you won't understand them at all. For
some odd reason, Guy can understand the leader beaver (the guy in the
northwest corner).  Ask him about the Goddess Bell and he'll tell you
that the right wall is fake.  So, head through the fake right wall.
Follow the path until you reach a grotto with a treasure chest in the
center.  Pop it open for a suit of Silver Armor, which you should give
to Josef.  Give Josef the IceWind item you were saving from earlier in
the Cave.  Then talk to the beast in front of the plaque, the Adamanti.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adamanti
Hp: 450 Mp: 0
Weakness: Ice
Reward: 500 Gil
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: Frioniel should attack, while Guy and Maria cast Ice.  Josef
should use the IceWind, then attack.  Thankfully, the Adamanti is not
strong enough to kill any one character in one blow, so you always have
the chance to Cure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After cracking the Adamanti's shell, examine the Plaque to get the Goddess
Bell. Now, follow the path through the door (you'll end up on floor 1).
Before going down the staircase to the exit, heal your characters.  Then
follow the stairs downwards until you run into Borgan, who valiantly
attacks you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borgan
Hp: 240 Mp: 20
Weakness: None
Reward: 400 Gil
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: For an Imperial General, Borgan is a joke.  Hack him to
pieces, magic won't help.  I killed him in 1 turn->he's VERY easy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After butchering Borgan, de-equip Josef (though he only has Leather and
Silver equipment, money is money).  Then head down the stairs.  A boulder
will start to follow, and your party will run.  Josef throws himself
against the boulder, and though Guy pleads for him to run, you're forced
to escape at the cost of Josef's life. Despite your grief, you have to
complete the mission, or Josef's death will be meaningless (yes, it's a
classic line). Head back to Salamando to rest.  The man in the upper left
corner talks about a race of birds, called Chocobos, which live south of
Kashuon.  This will be important a little bit later. Sell everything you
got in the Snow Cave(that you're not using) except the Mithril Javelin and
Josef's equipment.

You can now head back to the Rebel Hideout, where you'll be told to head
for Kashuon, or you can head for Kashuon yourself. I recommend going to
Altea and buying Cure for Frioniel.

To reach Kashuon, you have two options.  You can of course fly there, or
you can walk (I advise the latter).  Head southeast of Bofsk, and follow
the path until you see a gap in a mountain range with forest near it.
Head to the center of the circle this mountain range forms, and you'll
see Kashuon surrounded by another mountain range.  Save, and head inside.

=========================================================================
C.) Kashuon
Enemies: Ogre, WzOgre, Adamanti, LandTrtl, Shadow, Ghoul, Ghast, Wraith,
Mine, Balloon, WereRat, LegEater, VmpThrn, Goblin, G.Goblin, DesAngel,
Soldier
Treasures: Cure, 300 gil, Gold Shield, Mithril Sword, Were Cane, Mithril
Axe, Antidote, EchoScn, EyeDrop, Gold Armor, EgilTrch, SunFlame
Boss: R.Soul
=========================================================================

Upon entering, you can see the Sun Flame in the center of the entrance
area. Unfortunately, it won't be that easy...you need the EgilTrch to
move the blasted thing.  Use the Goddess Bell on the locked door north
of the Sun Flame. Head inside.  You'll meet Prince Gordon (remember
him?) here. Apparently, he tried to get the Sun Flame himself but
couldn't fight the monsters.  He has 64 HP  and no spells.  Give him
Cure, the Mithril Javelin, and any better armor you have.  He sucks, and
may die several times...but he is someone to take extra hits, so keep
him around.  In the southeast corner of this area is another Cure
booklet, give it to Frioniel.  The exit is in the southwest corner.  Head
east on the second floor and grab the 300 gil.  The exit is on the path.
 The third floor is a bit convoluted, so take the second path and grab
the Gold Shield in the southwest corner. It's guarded by WereRats, which
Guy and Frioniel can kill in one hit. The fourth floor is full of rooms,
but the northeastern room (the one that's facing a hall, slightly north
of the other room) holds some great treasure: Were Cane, Mithril Axe,
Mithril Sword.  Give the Were Cane to Gordon. Leave the treasure room
and progress to the stairwell. The next floor is disturbingly inhabited
by Adamantis, blast them with Ice, just as you did in the Snow Cave. Go
to the northeast room on the fifth floor for an Antidote, EchoScn, and
EyeDrop. Grab the Gold Armor from the middle. Finally, take the exit to
the sixth and final floor.  Make sure that you have enough mp to cure
the party forfour turns and make sure that you have full hp.  Then, talk
to the R.Soul blocking the path to the torch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
R.Soul
Hp: 540 Mp: 35
Weakness: None
Reward: 100 Gil
Attacks: Fire8, Bolt8, Ice8, Aero8, Physical Attack
Strategy: This boss is pretty tough.....A lot tougher than most others.
He'll blast your whole party with level 8 Ice, Fire, Aero, and Bolt spells
which do considerable damage at this point in the game.  To make matters
worse, elemental spells heal him, so you have to stick with physical
attacks (which frequently miss).  Have Maria cure the entire party and Guy
cure a damaged person while Frioniel and Gordon attack the beast. After 4
turns, R.Soul will run out of mp, and will be forced to attack you
physically.  He frequently misses, so this is your chance to finish him.
It'll take 3 or 4 more turns, but the R.Soul will die.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head north and grab the EgilTrch from the chest.  Cast Exit, and save,
cure, whatever.  Now head back inside Kashuon and go up to the Sun Flame.
Use the EgilTrch on the Sun Flame to obtain the powerful fire. Now head
back outside Kashuon.  You'll see the Warship persuing an airship and
ultimately catching it (the ship being attacked is obviously Cid's airship).

Walk directly south of Kashuon and you'll enter a forest/grassy
clearing. You'll see a white bird moving around. Catch it and you'll get
a Chocobo. Step outside and mount the Chocobo. Head to Bofsk (or any
other town), and rest up, sell excess equipment, make some space in your
inventory.

=========================================================================
D.) The Warship
Enemies: Soldier, Mage, Panther, Stunner, WereRat, Eagle, Ghoul, Ghast,
Wraith, Shadow, Sargeant
Treasures: 400 gil, Sleep Sword, Potionx2, Blind Bow, Thief Gauntlet,
Trident, Gouche Dagger, Ice Shield, Giant Helmet
Boss: None
=========================================================================

*Note: You need not head back to Altea, though it will tell you where the
Warship has landed.  Since you have this walkthrough, you won't need
that.*

In Altea, you'll learn that Cid had flown Hilda to greet you at Kashuon,
but the Warship intercepted them and have Cid and Hilda as prisoners.  How
are you going to get on the Warship now that Cid's Airship is gone???
Well, the Warship needs to refuel, and the Rebels believe that it landed
somewhere north of Phin.  Well, not only did it land north of Phin, it
landed in the most remote and isolated location in the world (well,
almost).  Open up your world map and scroll north of Phin.  The warship is
parked on that peninsula stretching for miles. Don't even try to walk
there unless your really strong or need a lot of gil...still, it's not
worth it.  Instead, return to the Chocobo forest and head south from
Kashuon.  You'll soon see the Warship parked, with its entrance ramp
extended.  Dismount, save, and head inside.

You can only go a couple of steps before you meet an Imperial soldier who
asks for a Pass.  Give him the Pass you found in the Bofsk Sewers, and
head east to the stairwell flanked by two soldiers.  Don't talk to anyone
in the Warship, other than Hilda and Cid, or you'll have to fight a
Captain (more than a match for you at this point).  After descending the
stairs, head east through the false wall (directly west of the treasure)
to get into the cell.  Open the treasure chest for the Sleep Sword, which
is guarded by Sargeants, Soldiers, and Mages.  Kill the Soldiers, then
Mages, then Sargeants.  Give Frioniel the Sleep Sword, as it *ACTUALLY*
puts some enemies to sleep. Head back to the entrance level. Head up the
stairs in the northwest and grab the treasure chest for 400 gil. Ignore
all the rooms along this catwalk, they are empty.  Follow the path until
you have the chance to go down and head to the northeastern room.  From
here, descend into another important area.  Get the two Potions in the
southeastern corner.  Also get the Blind Bow in the southwest and the
Thief Gauntlet in the South.  Give the Blind Bow to Maria and the Thief
Gauntlet to Frioniel.  You should be able to see Hilda and Cid in a cell.
Head over there, and push the gratings twice ("talk" to them) to fully
destroy the bars.  Talk to Cid and he'll tell you that he'll escort Hilda
outside.  That said, head back up to the first floor of the Warship.  This
time, follow the path all the way until the stairs, and head to the
southeast exit.  Follow this simple level to the exit (ignore those
captains wandering around under the grating). The third floor is full of
treasure, so head to the northeastern corner to see four treasure chests.
Get the West one for a Trident, the second to West one for a Gouche
Dagger, and the east one for a Giant Helm. Give the Giant Helm to Frioniel.
The remaining treasure chest holds the Ice Shield, but is guarded by
a Gigas and a Soldier.  The Soldier is a piece of cake, the Gigas is not.
Don't bother with this treasure chest, just go to the next level.  Proceed
through the straight forward levels (the maze area, where paths are
guarded by Captains, is easily tractable by going to the outer path
first).  Once you reach the Engine, examine it and use the SunFlame.  It
will begin to explode and the Dark Knight will show up, warning you that
it's not over yet.  Why is that voice so familiar?  Who could the Dark
Knight be??  You'll automatically exit the Warship and fly off in Cid's
Airship just as the Imperial weapon explodes.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER III: REBEL FLAME
=========================================================================
A.) Dist: Land of the Dragoons
Enemies: Shadow, Wraith, LandTrtl, Adamanti, WzOgre, Ogre, GrOgre,
Gigas, Stlctite, Ghoul, Ghast, Revenant, DualHead, Soul, G.Soul
Treasures: Curse, Stone, Stop, 30 gil, Pendant, Egg, Potion, Flame Bow,
Knight Armor, ElderIQ, Heart, Mithril Helmet, Mithril Armor, Magic Cane,
Mirror, Mithril Gauntlet, DrgnBean
Boss: Chimerax3
=========================================================================

You'll land outside of Altea.  Sell all excess weapons but the Gouche
Dagger. De-equip Gordon, keeping his Mithril stuff for Raila, your next
fourth party member.  Head to the rebel headquarters and you'll learn that
the king is dying. Head for his room, and he'll tell Gordon to take over
the Rebellion, Ming-Wu to unlock the sealed power, and you to go to Dist and
get the friendship of the dragoons.  So, you now have your mission.  Head
to the throne room and talk to Gordon. You'll learn that Dist was invaded
by the Empire recently. Learn the keyword Dragoon and say it back to him.
He'll say that the Dragoon's had a Hiryuu that will be of use.  Learn the
word Hiryuu, and head out.  You can learn from townsfolk that Dist is on
an isolated island to the east of Altea.  You can also pay a visit to
Hilda, who says Huhu.  What's with that? Forget it, and head for Palm.
Upon entering, talk to the other pirate (Raila) and she says she's heading
for Dist and wants to travel with you.  Maria smells a rat, but Guy quells
her fears and you agree.  Exit Palm and you'll see the ship docked a bit
east of the town.  Go board it, and it'll start sailing south.  Then, in
the middle of the ocean, it'll stop.  Raila and some pirates will surround
you, asking you to surrender your possessions.  You'll be thrown into a
fight with 8 pirates.  This fight is incredibly easy, as the Pirates do
from 0-10 damage and frequently miss.  It takes three turns to beat these
guys, maybe four. When it's finished, Raila will join you, bringing her
ship with her. Finally, you sail the far seas of FF2j...YES!!!

First thing's first, give Raila all of Gordon's equipment.  You may have
noticed (or not) that Raila has two weapons equipped, but only attacks
with the one in her left hand, because she's left handed.  So put her
shield in her right hand and weapon in her left hand.  There is only one
other character in the game like this, so you can't get confused =). Sell
her excess equipment, and give her Goldpin Helm to Maria. Now's a great
time to head for Mysidia, not located on the map.  From Altea, sail
southeast until you pass through the strait in between the land areas (on
the map it looks like a long finger).  Sail west now until your ship
reaches the mouth of a river.  Canoe up the river for a little bit, then
head east towards the mountain range.  You should see a town around the
area. If you run into Mallows and Puddings, beware that physical attacks
don't hurt them. Blast the Mallows with Bolt and the Puddings with Fire.
Upon entering Mysidia, you can visit the weapons and armor shops (which
have some of the best equipment in the game), or the magic shop.  First,
buy a Thief Gauntlet for Raila, Maria, and Guy (Frioniel should have the
one you got in the Warship).  Also, get an Ice Shield for Frioniel, Guy,
and Raila. Finally, get Knight Armor for everyone.  At the weapons shop,
get the Ice Bow for Maria and the Ogre Axe for Guy. Decked out with this
awesome equipment, the rather tough Dist Cave will become a piece of cake.
 If you want, swing by the Magic Shop to take a look at their Holy and
Change spells, though I doubt you'll want it right now.  This may prove
costly, but it's worth it.

When you're done in Mysidia, sail to Bofsk, and rest up. Now, sail
directly east of Bofsk to Dist, the land of the Dragoons.  Walk to the
castle and enter. You'll see a boy, who runs from you.  Follow the path he
was blocking. You'll see him again, and he'll say that he'll tell his mom
about you. Well, follow him again.  You can see him and his mom standing
in front of a door.  Before talking with them, get all the treasure in
Dist Castle.  On the second floor, get the Cottage from the northwest,
then head to the southwest stairs.  Get the FenixDn.   Take the stairs to
the third floor.  Grab the Unicorn from the southeast chest, then work
towards the eastern room.  Get Stone, Curse, and Stop.  Curse is pretty
good, as for Stone and Stop you may want to sell them or give them to
Frioniel. Go to the northeast room to get a load of treasures: ElderIQ,
Heart, Winged Sword, G.Needle, Eyedrop, Antidote, Crucifix, and an
EchoScn. Unlike the Ancient and Sleep Swords, the Winged Sword has a
decent hit%. Equip it immediately.  Make sure you have two spaces in your
inventory, then head for the two citizens of Dist Castle. Elina, the
mother, will say that her husband, the last Dragoon, died; the Dragoons
are finished. Ask here about the Hiryuu and she'll say that she can't
communicate with the only remaining Hiryuu, which was poisoned by the
Empire. She'll say that you need a Dragoon's pendant to do that.  Try
talking to the Hiryuu and you'll see her point.

Exit the castle and head north to the Dist Cave. From the entrance,
simply head east, grab the 30 gil, and descend the staircase.  Talk to
the skeleton to get the Pendant. Head back to Dist.  Go talk to the
Hiryuu, who will give you an Egg to plant in the Spring of Life (in the
Dist Cave).  When asked, he'll tell you that a Dragoon named Richard
left to look for Ultima before the Empire attacked, and may still be
alive.  Talk to Elina for some info about the Spring of Life (not
needed), then head out, save, and check your stats. Make sure that
everyone has at least 400 hp, Maria has at least 50 mp, and Frioniel has
a sword skill level of 9. To build up weapon skills, wander around the
Dist Island; the monsters here give more weapon points than in previous
areas.

When you're set, head back to the Dist Caves. There are three
stairwells on the first floor of the Dist Cave.  The northeast one leads
to the Pendant.  The southeast stairs lead to the Spring of Life. The
Southwest stairs lead to the Knight Armor, Flame Bow, and other
treasures, not integral. Since you already have the Knight Armor and the
Ice Bow (which is better than the Flame Bow), you need not take the
southwest stairs. I'll give you the directions anyway, as you may need
the gil after your..."ambitious" purchases in Mysidia.  So, take the
southwest stairs. On your way to the stairs, grab the Potion. Proceed to
level three (northwest exit to level four) and then four.  The Knight
Armor, guarded by an Adamanti, is in the southeast.  The Flame Bow is in
the northwest, the ElderIQ in the northeast and the Heart in the
Southwest.  Either hike back up or Exit and re-enter the cave. Either
way, take the southeastern stairs this time. Get the Mithril Helmet
(easternmost passage), the Mithril Armor (Second), and the Magic Cane
(third).  The Magic Cane is guarded by G.Souls which can easily be taken
by your newfound weapons. Take the southwest stairs (the southeast
stairs will ultimately net you a Mithril Gauntlet and a Mirror (not
really worth it). On the third floor, be careful to avoid the bridge
(Which falls to an area you may have passed on your trek to the Knight
Armor).  On level four, get the DrgnBean (an okay attack item).  At the
four-door wall, take the door second from the east. Heal up, then talk
to the fiends blocking the path to the Spring of Life. It's a pack of
Chimeras, rather easily defeated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chimerax3
Hp: 640 Mp: 80
Weakness: None
Reward: 600 Gil
Attacks: Fire7, Physical Attack
Strategy: Though conceivably hard, the Chimeras are just a weaker R.Soul.
They pack less magic power, a weaker spell, and are fighting tougher
characters.  To balance it out, there is more than one Chimera. However,
take them out one at a time (everyone hits one) and they will die in
three, maybe four turns.  Plus, your Ice Shields should be protecting you
against their fire magic, so it should be an easy fight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Chimeras vanquished, head to the Spring and use the Egg.  With
The mission accomplished, cast Exit.  When passing Dist, you can swing buy
The Castle and learn that the Hiryuu has died. What's in store for the
Dragoons?? Head back to Altea.

=========================================================================
B.) The Arena
Enemies: Column, DualHead, DualZomb, Revenant, Flower, Spectre. Captain,
Sargeant, Sorcerer, Wizard, Ray, Antlion
Treasures: Antidote, Cottage, Ether, Elixir
Bosses: Q. Lamia, Behemoth
=========================================================================

Upon entering Altea, head for the rebel hideout.  Avoid the southeast
room, for now.  You'll learn that Hilda has been acting very strangely
lately. Gordon will ask you to find out what's wrong. Save, de-equip
Raila, and head for the southeast room.  Talk to Hilda, who'll crawl into
bed and ask Frioniel to join her.  The rest of the party will leave, though
Raila is suspicious. Frioniel goes to the bed, then realizes that it's not
Hilda at all, but the Queen Lamia. The party joins you as you battle the
monster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Lamia
Hp: 1290 Mp: 370
Weakness: None
Reward: 10000 Gil
Attacks: Wink9, Blnk16, Physical Attack
Strategy: This fight is supposed to be hard, and if you didn't go and get
superior  equipment, it would've been (look, I like saying that okay?).
Now, you have  three  good attackers (okay, mainly Frioniel and Guy) and
Raila (de-equipped) as a semi-magician (bolt). So, cast Bolt  with Raila
and hammer the Q. Lamia with Frioniel, Guy, and Maria. The thing will die
in two turns, or at most four.  However, there is a rogue possibility that
your attackers will all be confused, in which case...ouch. But still, the
boss is quite easy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, Raila will tell you to never trust a female.  A
messenger will arrive bearing bad news: The emperor is hosting a
tournament at Paramekia. The winner will receive as a prize Princess
Hilda.  Gordon will rush in, asking to help you rescue the Princess.
Raila leaves to help train the Rebel Army, and Gordon joins.  Give him
all of Raila's equipment, then sniff around for info. Apparently, the
tournament will not be held at Paramekia Castle, but at the Arena.  Both
are located in harsh territory. The Arena is located next to a forest
blocked to the east by a mountain range and to the west by a desert.
It's overshadowed by the dark citadel of Paramekia Castle.  You
should've seen this on your way to the Warship. You'll also learn that
the Rebellion is planning a sneak attack on the Emperor while you get
the Princess back.  Well, I'm fairly sure you know where to go. Sail to
Poft and fly to Kashuon. Grab the Chocobo from the forest and head south
into the desert.  Save in front of the Arena and head inside. Follow the
very, very complicated path to the courtyard and head up to the
Emperor's throne.  He'll tell you to fight for the Princess, and a
Behemoth will crawl out of the grating and attack you. This is the first
REAL boss in FFII, it's a shame that he's a piece of cake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behemoth
Hp: 1620 Mp: 0
Weakness: None
Reward: 0 Gil
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: Hammer him with your weapons, magic is useless.  He's too weak
to kill anyone in three turns (except Gordon) and it only takes three
turns to defeat him. His physical attacks do about 200 damage-> your
attacks should do that or more.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After defeating the Behemoth, you'll talk to the Emperor, who reveals that
he recognized you (it's not like you made any attempt to mask your
identity anyway).  He'll vanish, and two Captains and the Dark Knight will
appear. They'll throw you in prison. When you come to, "talk" to the bars.
Paul will appear, sneaking up to the white cloaked Imperial guarding your
cell. He'll kill the Imperial and free you, as a gesture of thanks for
saving him in Semite Cave (he hates owing favors). What're you waiting
for? It's time to get the hell out of here. You can get an Antidote in the
southeast (not worth it) and a Cottage, Ether, and Elixir in the east room
(worth it). Head up the stairwell to the second level.  Move around the
wall until you can see the Princess in her cell (and you are to the east
of her). There is a fake wall here, so go through it.  De-equip Gordon,
then free the Princess.  She'll leave with Gordon.  Now follow the path to
surface in the southwest corner of the Arena. Exit, save, and trek north
to the forest south of Kashuon (Chocobo Forest). Along the way you'll
fight Antlions and Rays, which are not very hard to kill but may require
several turns.  When you get the Chocobo, ride it back to Poft. Rest at
the inn, then sail your ship south to Altea.

=========================================================================
C.) The Rebels Strike Back
Enemies: Captain, Sorcerer, Wizard, Sargeant, Soldier, Stunner
Treasures: None
Boss: Gotus
=========================================================================

A messenger in Altea will tell you that the Rebels are going to invade
Phin And set up camp west of Gatea.  Head northwest to that orange tent.
You'll find it swarming with rebels beseeching you to help them capture
Phin while monsters swarm about causing havoc.  Gordon tells you to leave
no survivors. So, head for Phin. This is not as fun as it may seem.  Your
goal is not to wander around the town of Phin butchering the Imperial
Captains.  You just need to defeat the commanding Imperial Officer,
Commander Gotus. So head to the castle and walk straight to the throne
room, ignore the treasure.  Raila will join again, so equip her. Heal up,
then talk to Gotus (who has a great dialogue, right?).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gotus
Hp: 2000 Mp: 80
Weakness: None
Reward: 2000 Gil
Attacks: Hast6, Drink, Physical Attack
Strategy: Depending on how Gotus decides to play, this fight can be
anywhere from incredibly easy to mildly difficult. Gotus can greatly
enhance his attack by using a Bacchus Wine.  This casts Drink on him,
raising his attack power. His haste spell increases the number of hits he
deals.  With both increased attack and increased hits, he'll pose a
serious threat to your party. Otherwise he'll only hit for 100-350 damage.
It should take little more than two turns to destroy him.  If he does use
the stat-enhancing spells/items, cure whoever he attacks with your fastest
character, as there is a great chance that he'll attack that same
character again the next turn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Commander Gotus defeated, Phin Castle is turned over to the rebels.
Now, all the monsters are gone and you are free to roam the castle.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER IV: THE SEALED POWER
=========================================================================
A.) Catacombs
Enemies: Revenant, Ghast, Wraith, Column, Stunner, Sucker, Changer, Brain,
Mantis, Adamanti, WzOgre, GrOgre, G.Chimera
Treasures: 4000 Gil, Potionx5, Giant Gauntlet, Aura, Were Cane, Gold
Shield, Gold Armor, Quartz Armor, Knife, EyeDrop, Clothes, Flame Shield,
Thread, Fang, Flame Armor, Blood Sword, Orhacon Dagger, W.Mask
Boss: None
=========================================================================

Talk to Hilda and Gordon, who'll tell you to retrieve the sealed power
Ultima. From Hilda, learn Mysidia.  Say it back to her to learn about
Ultima, the sealed magic.  Again, say the keyword back to her.  She'll
mention the masks, which you need to learn.  Now, ask her about the Masks
and she'll tell you that one is hidden in Phin and can be found using the
chant Ekume. She doesn't know where to use the chant though. Ask Gordon
about Ekume, and he'll tell you to ask Paul (good idea, for once).

You'll want to return to the castle and take all the loot, so go there
before buying any new equipment. On the first floor, get the 1000 gil in
the northeast, another 1000 gil in the northwest, and 2000 gil in the
north. Head up through the southeast stairs.   Go into the next area.  In
the northeast room are three spells: Toad, Break, and Death. Now, head
back to the first floor and take the center staircase. There's a Potion to
the west which is guarded by Ghasts, Stunners, Revenants, and
Wraiths...not really worth it.  From the Potion, head east through a false
wall and get the Giant Gauntlet.  Give it to someone who doesn't have a
Giant Helmet. The Spell Aura is to the east, and is guarded by Sorcerers
and Sargeants. The Spell isn't very good, but can be sold. Pass through a
false wall a bit south and west of Aura and head northwest to the Were
Cane.  Now, head into the throne room and go to the northeast corner of
the room.  Talk to the walls, one will give you the option of saying
Ekume.  Say it, and pass through the wall. Follow the path down until you
reach and area where you can see the rest of the cast (you can see grass
to the east.  A part of the east wall is fake, pass through it and
carefully head south.  Now pass west through a false wall in this region,
and head for the treasure room. Grab the Gold Shield, Quartz Armor, and
Gold Armor.  Now, exit through the grass and head to Phin Town.  Sell the
Were Cane, Gold Armor, and Quartz Armor. Make sure everyone is rested. You
can ask Paul about Ekume, and he'll tell you to look in the northeast
corner of the room (you already knew that, though).

Head for the passage in Phin Castle.  This time, keep going down the
stairs and you'll end up in Catacombs. The first floor is inhabited by
Revenants, Ghasts, Wraiths, and Stunners, so there is nothing to worry
about.  You can get a Knife in the Southeast, an Eyedrop in the
northwest, and Clothes in the northeast.  The exit is near the Clothes in
the northeast. The second floor is inhabited by Suckers, Changers, and
Brains: new yet easy to kill enemies. You can get a Potion northeast of
the entrance, another Potion in the southwest, and a MaidKiss in the
northwest.  Again, the exit is in the northeast. The only monster on the
third floor is the Mantis, which is actually pretty strong. You can get a
Potion in the southeast, a Thread in the northwest, and the Flame Shield
in the southwest.  Give this Shield to Frioniel.  Head for the northwest
exit. The foes on the fourth floor are Adamantis, GrOgres, WzOgres, and
Columns. They give quite a bit of gil and occasionally drop Blink, Ice,
and Blind. Get the Blood Sword in the northeast, which is guarded by
Ghasts, Spectres, Revenants, and Wraiths. After butchering the Undead,
you'll get what is quite possibly the best weapon in the game.  It is
completely useless until the final boss, to which the sword deals
tremendous damage. So, equip on Frioniel as an item, not as a sword.  Now
get the Flame Armor in the Northeast and give it to Frioniel. Also, there
is a Fang in the southeast.  Take the southeastern exit to the fifth
floor. In the southeast, get the Orhacon Dagger. It's guarded by
G.Chimeras, who are only a little stronger than the Chimeras you butchered
in Dist.  Give the Orhacon to Raila. Head northeast.  You'll eventually
come to a wall with six doors, take the door second from the east. Proceed
up the steps and get the W.Mask, then head north and exit through the
pentagram. You can ask Hilda and Gordon about what to do next: they'll
tell you to sniff around in Mysidia for clues.  So, head for Mysidia.

=========================================================================
B.) B. Mask Cave
Enemies: Mallow, Jelly, DualHead, DualZomb, WereRat,Stunner, Tusk, G.Toad
Treasures: EyeDrop, Xpotionx2, Ether, Threadx2,Aerox2, Blindx2, Garlic,
1000 gil,  FenixDn, EarthDrm, Valiumx2,DeathGod, Sleep, B.Mask
Boss: BigHorn
=========================================================================

In Mysidia (which you've visited before), you'll learn that you need the
two masks and a crystal rod to unseal the Tower of Mysidia and thus obtain
the ultimate magic, Ultima.  One person will tell you to place the White
Mask on the goddess statue, so go ahead and do that (the goddess statue
he's talking about is the one that can be accessed by stairs).  Finally,
you'll learn that the Black Mask was hidden somewhere on an island cave.
Well, when you were sailing here, you did notice that small, isolated
island, right? That's the Black Mask Cave.  Before heading there, swing by
the magic shop. You'll want to get Change and Holy for your three main
characters.

When your done, head for the B. Mask Cave. You can get the EyeDrop in the
southeast, the two Xpotions (one in the northeast, one in the northwest),
an Ether in the south and a Thread in the southwest.  Take the western
exit. On the second floor, there's a Valium in the northwest, an Aero
spell in the northwest, a Blind Spell in the southeast and southwest, and
another Aero spell in the south.  There are also two staircases here.  The
northwest staircase will lead you to the Mask Village, a small town
inhabited by mask-wearing freaks.  One of them sells an EarthDrm, Ruby
Armor, Demon Axe, and Demon Lance.  None of these items are
extraordinarily good, so I don't think you should go there.  But if you
want to go there, there is a Thread on the floor directly below the
southwest staircase (east). Proceed to the fourth floor and the fifth
floor will be the Mask Village. If you choose (rather wisely) to not waste
your time with the Mask Village, take the center staircase on the second
floor.  Get the Garlic in the south and head for the stairs.  The fourth
floor has a 1000 gil chest in the northeast. There are four staircases on
the fourth floor (not counting the initial entrance).  The southeast
staircase will take you through two levels, taking you to a secluded area
of the seventh floor  The treasures have two Valiums and an EarthDrm
(guarded by Tusks and a G.Toad).  Retrace your way back to the fourth
floor and take the southwest staircase.  You'll get a FenixDn here, it's
guarded by Shadows, Wraiths, and Ghasts.  This time, take the northwest
staircase.  Procure the DeathGod from the center. Finally, take the one
remaining staircase, the northeast one.  Get Sleep in the northeast, then
go to the west.  You'll have to face BigHorn, the guardian of the BMask.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BigHorn
Hp: 1140 Mp: 0
Weakness: None
Reward: 1000 Gil
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: At 1140 hp, this boss is a joke.  You might have fought him
around Mysidia.  The simplest way to kill him is to attack him every turn.
He should die on the third turn, or sooner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the BMask and warp out of the cave.  Head back to Mysidia.

=========================================================================
C.) Mysidian Cave
Enemies: Brain, Coctrice, Molbor, Sucker, Changer, Spectre, Wraith, Ghast,
Pudding, Mallow, Jelly, Soul, R.Soul, Flier, P.Toad
Treasures: Goldpin Helm, Black Armor, Flame Javelin, Power Cane, Ice Bow,
Ogre Axe, G. Needle, FenixDn, SilentB, Potionx5, Mini, Aspil, Drain,
CrystRod
Boss: None
=========================================================================

You'll learn that the CrystRod is buried in the Mysidian Cave.  The cave
is east of Mysidia, enclosed in a mountain range (don't worry, you can
still get in on foot).  Rest up, sell your excess items, and head for the
cave.

Dock your ship near the desert and make your way north to the cave. Get
the Goldpin Helm in the north and give it to Frioniel.  Give the Black
Armor you can find in the southeast to Maria.  Head to the exit, which is
blocked by a doppelganger of Frioniel.  Remember, the Black Mask is
supposed to go on a drone?  Use the Black Mask on the doppelganger and
he'll vanish. Head through the exit he was blocking. On the second floor,
there's a Power Cane in the north and a Flame Javelin in the northwest. To
reach the Flame Javelin, you'll have to walk through a fake wall.  Now,
head to the exit and descend to the third floor.  Here you can grab an Ice
Bow in the northwest (again, there's a fake wall) and an Ogre Axe in the
southeast.  The Ogre Axe is protected by Bombs, which are easy in a nearly
obscene way.  Head to the exit and the fourth floor.  The fourth floor
doesn't have any worthwhile treasure.  You can get a G.Needle, SilentB,
and FenixDn in the center room (you can buy the FenixDn and G.Needle, and
the SilentB sucks) and a Potion in the northeast (Potions are long
outdated).  Head to the fifth floor. The fifth floor actually contains
some good treasure.  In the northeast you'll find Drain (it's protected by
Ghosts, slightly stronger than Spectres).  Of the  five treasures
protected by the fake wall, the eastern one is the best (Mini), the rest
are Potions.  When you're done, head to the northeast room (a bit annoying
to find the path to the stairs, but it's linear).  The room contains
Aspil, Drain, and the CrystRod.

Once you have the CrystRod, warp outside and head back to Altea (don't go
near the crescent bay with a tower in it).  Heal up, rest, sell excess
items, and de-equip Raila.  Now, head for that crescent bay.  As you enter
the crescent, tidal waves will wash over your ship and you'll awaken in
strange area, with Raila nowhere to be seen.

=========================================================================
D.) Leviathan
Enemies: SeaDrgn, ElecFish, MantaRay
Treasures: Spiral Helm, Power Armor, Power Gauntlet, Diamond Shield, Earth
Sword
Boss: Worm
=========================================================================

This area, which in reality is the stomach of Leviathan, is fairly easy To
navigate, yet contains enemies that actually put up a fight.  The Colored
liquid is not water, but stomach acid.  You'll lose 1 HP for step inside
the liquid, but no monsters will challenge you there.  Grab the Spiral
Helm and give it to Guy.  Head north, and get the power armor in the
northeast corner. Give it to Maria.  Take the northwest exit. You'll
arrive in a town built by victims of Leviathan.  Supposedly, the Leviathan
protects the seal by consuming those who have Crystal Rods. You'll also
learn that there is a boat on the third floor, but no one has defeated the
monster guarding it yet.  (Of course, you'll have to defeat the beast).
There is a man blocking your path, show him a CrystRod and he'll join,
introducing himself as Richard the Dragoon. Richard is pretty good, but he
has no spells.  With Richard, head through the northwest exit.  The
southeast treasure contains the Diamond Shield and is protected by R.
Souls (remember the guy in Kashuon?).  Now that you are MUCH stronger,
just smack them to hell in one hit. Give the Diamond Shield to Frioniel and
the Flame Shield to Richard. Now get the Earth Sword from the northeast
corner.  Give it to Frioniel. Finally, head west and attack the beast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worm
Hp: 2000 Mp: 0
Weakness: None
Reward: 2000 Gil
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: The Worm hits for 150-350 damage, which is pretty good. However,
you should also hit 250-350 damage, and all four of your characters should
be attacking. The Worm should fall in four or five turns, maybe three.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After killing the Land Worm, get on the boat to find yourself at the mouth
of the crescent bay.

=========================================================================
E.) Tower of Mysidia
Enemies: Spectre, Revenant, Basilisk, L.Molbor, DvFlower, Chimera, Mallow,
Pudding, Flower, Mantis, VmpGirl, Imp, Werewolf, Gigas, Bomb, BigHorn,
Flier, Basilisk
Treasures: Canex3, WhtRobe, Flame Shield, Flame Bow, Flame Javelin, Flame
Helm, Flame Sword, Flame Armor, Ice Armor, Ice Shield, Ice Gauntlet, Ice
Javelin, Ice Sword, Potion, Evil Cane, Unicorn, Thread, Shoes, Flare,
Eggtimer, Crucifix, BlkRobe, Ultima
Bosses: F. Gigas, I. Gigas, T. Gigas, Dragon
=========================================================================

The Tower of Mysidia can be extremely annoying and challenging.  I would
recommend going in with everyone over 1700 hp (preferably 2000). Your
Three main character should have 150 max MP or higher (at least if they
have mediocre magic abilities, that is).  You should also have an Aero
spell of level 5 or higher.  Sound hard?  Well, it's actually not that
difficult to dramatically increase your stats.  Simply walk around Altea
and cast Change (on level 3 or higher) on Goblins, Leg Eaters, and
Hornets.  Doing so will cause an increase in HP, MP, VIT, SOUL, and M.PWR.
See the tricks section for more info.  I would also recommend having a
character with Level 5 or higher Heal, so you can cure petrifaction.  If
you want, you can also head to Dist or Phin with Richard in your party for
some added dialogue.

When you're ready, head for the Tower of Mysidia. The first floor has four
treasures, only one actually worth getting. There is a Cane in the
northeast, northwest, and southeast corners that I suggest you ignore.
Instead, get the WhtRobe from the north area (walk through the fake wall).
Take the central stairs to level two. Get the Flame Shield from the
northwest. You can get a Flame Bow and a Flame Javelin in the northeast,
but considering you already have an Ice Bow and none of your characters
are using Javelins (or are they?) it's not necessary to get them. To
actually reach the exit, take the southwestern path.  Take the
southeastern exit to level three. This floor is covered in steaming lava
which behaves like Leviathan's stomach acid.  Head for the western door
and take it to enter a new area.  Here, get the Flame Sword in the
northeast (give it to Frioniel and give the Earth Sword to Richard). Also
get the Flame Armor in the northeast and the Flame Helm in the northwest.
I usually give the Flame Armor to Richard, and give the Flame Helm to
Maria (since Guy already has a Spiral Helm, if not give it to Guy). It
doesn't really matter who has it, as long as somebody does. When you take
the northern door, it'll lead you to a staircase blocked by a mage. Heal
up, then speak with the mage, who becomes the Fire Gigas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
F. Gigas
Hp: 1800 Mp: 240
Weakness: Ice
Reward: Flame Sword, Flame Armor
Attacks: Fire12, Rock9, Physical Attack
Strategy: The F.Gigas only hits for about 300 damage, while you can rack
up 700 max damage to him per turn.  If you have strong Ice spells (lv.8
and above), blast this sucker with them.  He'll go down pretty fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the F.Gigas dropped a Flame Sword or Armor, give it to Richard.  If
not, don't worry, you'll get a better sword and another suit of armor soon
enough . The fourth floor is suddenly cold, a contrast from the molten
lava below.  You can get an Ice Shield in the northwest, an Ice Gauntlet
in the southwest, and some Ice Armor in the southeast.  Go ahead and give
the Ice Gauntlet to Frioniel.  Give the Ice Armor to any character for whom
the defense is better (probably the guy who has the Power Armor).  The
western staircase will lead you to the Ice Javelin.  Whether you choose to
get it or not, head to the northeastern staircase. This level is covered
in freezing water which behave like the lava.  Make sure to get the Ice
Sword to the east for Frioniel.  Head to the door.  Heal up, and speak to
the mage, the Ice Gigas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Gigas
Hp: 2000 Mp: 240
Weakness: Fire
Reward: 1000 gil
Attacks: Ice12, Rock9, Physical Attack
Strategy: Though considerably tougher than the Fire Gigas, the I.Gigas is
still fairly easy. Attack with everyone, or use Fire8+ spells.  He should
be taking 300-500 damage a turn, making this a short battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sixth floor looks more like the earlier floors of the tower. There's a
Potion in the northeast corner that you should ignore. Instead, follow the
Path leading southwest.  Be sure to get the Evil Cane from the chest.
Equip it as a battle item on Richard.  Head through the door and to the
seventh floor. You can get a Unicorn in the north (center), Shoes in the
northeast corner, and a Thread in the south (center).  When you're
finished, head for the western room. Heal up, and talk to the mage, who
becomes the terrifying Thunder Gigas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
T. Gigas
Hp: 2500 Mp: 370
Weakness: Aero
Reward: 1000 gil
Attacks: Bolt12, Rock9, Physical Attack
Strategy: Unlike his brothers, the Thunder Gigas is actually challenging.
Have Frioniel attack as usual, or if he has a level 5+ Aero spell, use
that. Maria should cast Aero5+, and Guy should heal. Richard, who has the
Evil Cane, should use it as an item.  It casts Aero16 on a random target
(e.g., I used it at this boss and the cane cast Aero16 on the Emperor). If
it connects with the T.Gigas, it will do massive damage (700+).  Follow
this strategy and the T.Gigas will eventually die.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With that beast killed, head up to the 8th floor.  Be sure to get Flare
from the northeast treasure.  Flare is guarded by Gotus and a DvFlower
(what the hell is an Imperial Commander doing here?) that die easily and
sometimes drop a Ripper Knife.  The exit is the door below Flare. The
water on this floor is not harmful, so enemies can attack you in it. Get
the Eggtimer to the east and the Crucifix to the southwest. Now, head to
the northeast treasure chest.  It's guarded by a Dragon that is basically
the I.Gigas on steroids. If you feel up to the fight, heal up and open the
chest for BlkRobe armor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon
Hp: 2500 Mp: 140
Weakness: Fire
Reward: 10000 gil
Attacks: Ice16, Physical Attack
Strategy: The Dragon is the first of four Dragons that guard treasure in
FF2. His Ice16 spell will hit for 100-200 damage to all, and his physical
attack will do 300-400 damage.  This is the last boss in the Tower of
Mysidia, so hit him with high end Fire spells (if you have any) or just
plain attacks.  He'll die eventually, without taking too much of a toll on
the party.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give the BlkRobe to Frioniel or Guy.  Then head to the northwestern terrace
And take the door second to west. Head north and talk to Ming-Wu, who says
he'll give his best shot to destroy the seal.  In doing so, he dies.  Head
through the door that Ming-Wu gave his life to open.  You'll enter a room
with five crystals in it.  The southeastern one raises your agility, the
northeastern one raises your intelligence, the northwestern one raises
your soul, the southwestern one raises your strength, and the center one
gives you the sealed magic, Ultima (Give it to Maria when you get a
chance). You'll be warped outside the tower, the sealed magic in hand.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER V: THE FALL OF AN EMPIRE
=========================================================================
A.) Whirlwind
Enemies: Coctrice, Gotus, DvFlower, Corpse, Captain, Lamia, Bomb, Gigas,
Golem, Wizard
Treasures: Hiryuu, Ripper Knife, Poison Axe, Diamond Helmet, Diamond
Gauntlet, Defense Sword, Diamond Armor, WindFlut
Bosses: General, G.Dragon, Emperor
=========================================================================

In your absence, the Emperor used his magic to summon a Whirlwind that
began ravaging the lands. It destroyed Poft, Palm, Gatea, and Altea.  It
has also attacked Phin, killing almost everyone. The whirlwind has thrown
everyone trying to attack it out to sea, and if you try to enter it on
foot you'll be ripped apart.  What to do?  Head for Phin Castle. You can
see that Raila has made it back safe and sound.  Learn Whirlwind from
Hilda or Gordon and recite it back to them.  They'll hint at a solution to
entering the Whirlwind.  Ask Hilda about the Hiryuu and she'll say the
Pendant can bring out the light of our mirror.  Head to the Hall of
Mirrors (southwest staircase on first floor of Phin, then northwest).  Use
the Pendant at the Mirror and you'll see the Hiryuu egg hatch.  The Hiryuu
will fly right through the windows of Phin castle and approach you.  The
Hiryuu and Dragoon are re-united again, and its time to kill the Emperor
(who's inside the Whirlwind). You also have the Hiryuu Flute item now,
which can be useful. First, say Whirlwind to Paul and he'll tell you to
check near the bed. There is a fake wall to the east of his bed that leads
to 8 treasure chests. They are the Black Armor, Ruby Armor, Thief
Gauntlet, Quartz Armor, Elixir, Goldpin Helm, Silver Armor, and Blood
Sword.  Keep the Blood Sword (you should also have the one you found in
the Catacombs), as it will be useful for the final battle.  Now, sell all
your excess junk and useless battle items like Thread and Valium, if
you've got any of those.

Rest up, and head for the Whirlwind directly northeast of Phin. On the
first floor, take the northeast staircase for now.  Get the Ripper Knife
in the northeast and continue onwards.  On the third floor, get the Poison
Axe in the southwest chest and give it to Guy. Head back to the first
floor. Take the northwest exit this time.  Pass through level two, then on
level three take the north staircase.  Get the Diamond Helm from the
northeast and the Diamond Gauntlet from the northwest.  Head back to the
third floor, this time taking the southwest staircase.  Take the southern
staircase on the fourth floor.  Get the Defense Sword in the southeast and
give it to Frioniel (give the Ice Sword to Richard).  Then, go to the
southwest treasure chest and prepare to fight a General for the Diamond
Armor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
General
Hp: 1800 Mp: 0
Weakness: None
Reward: 2000 gil, Diamond Gauntlet, Rune Axe
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: He hits for 500 damage, but he's outnumbered. Just attack him
mercilessly and he'll die.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now head back to the fourth floor and take the southeast staircase. Head
up to level 6, and go to the northeast corner.  Heal up, then prepare to
fight the G.Dragon for a WindFlut.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.Dragon
Hp: 3000 Mp: 190
Weakness: Bolt
Reward: 10000 gil, Fang
Attacks: Mist16, Physical Attack
Strategy: If you have high end Bolt spells (lv.5+) throw them at this
fiend. If not, attack him, making  sure to designated a healer that can
undo his physical attacks (500 damage) and his repeated Mist16 attacks
(100-200 damage to the party). His defense is a lot stronger than that of
the Dragon in the Tower of Mysidia, so although he only has 500 more hp,
it'll take several more turns to defeat this one (barring a good Bolt
spell).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now head through the door, heal up, and go into the courtyard.  The
Emperor will tell you not to waste his time and call a squadron of Corpses
on you. Kill them, and he'll call yet another one.  Finally, he'll take
you on himself (of course, with bodyguards).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emperor (with 2 Corpses and a Golem)
Hp: 1290 Mp: 190
Weakness: None
Reward: None
Attacks: Slow9, Barr8, Bolt10, Blnk8, Physical Attack
Strategy: Kill the two Corpses first, then butcher the Golem.  Have
someone ready to cast Cure on the party in the case of serious double
teaming (the Golem and Corpses may attack the same party member).  The
Emperor himself will die in two hits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After defeating him, the emperor will say he's immortal, yet somehow he'll
die and you return to Phin, victorious.

=========================================================================
B.) Paramekia
Enemies: DvFlower, Skull, Golem, DkKnight, General, Gotus, Amoeba, Lamia,
VmpGirl, StGolem, Coctrice, Mantis, Flower
Treasures: Diamond Armor, Garlic, Eggtimer, Knife, Buckler Shield, Bolt
Javelin, Heart, Valium, Magic Cane, Greed Cane, Evil Cane, Sun Sword,
Elixirx3,WindFlut, Hellfire
Boss: Shade
=========================================================================

Upon hearing news of the Emperor's death, celebrations begin in Phin. They
Are interrupted, however, when a messenger arrives saying that the Dark
Knight has crowned himself emperor.  Not only that, but the Dark Knight
is....Leonheart! You have to head for Paramekia to and either convince him
to join you or kill him.  The only problem is, Paramekia is surrounded by
mountains and cannot be accessed by foot or water.  Head into Phin and go
to Paul's house.  He'll tell you that Cid is in pretty bad shape.  Go talk
to Cid, and you can tell that he's dying.  The Whirlwind caught him and
tore him up pretty badly.  He tells you to look after his Airship, then
dies. Now you know how to get into Paramekia, don't you?  Head for Poft
and board the Airship there.

You can now go anywhere in the world, but your destination is Paramekia,
the dark castle overlooking the Arena southeast of Kashuon. Position your
shadow over the highest part of the castle and land. You'll appear near
the top of the castle, so follow the path. Unfortunately, you'll be thrown
to the first floor. NOTE: The General enemies possess very valuable
treasure.  They have Diamond Gauntlets (which are very good) and rarely,
Rune Axes.  There is only supposed to be one Rune Axe in the game, which
you'll find later on, but if you can get that super-powerful weapon
earlier, there's nothing wrong, is there?  In addition, Gotus enemies drop
Bacchus, an item that boosts attack power and is helpful during tough boss
fights.  Try to have at least one for Frioniel's use at the final boss,
though having more is not a bad idea. Get the Diamond Armor to the west,
and give it to Guy.  There is a Garlic in the southwest that I don't think
you'll want to get, it's pretty bad.  If you want another Eggtimer, take
the eastern staircase on the first floor. Follow the path for this
mediocre battle item.   That done (or not), take the southern stairs.
Here, you could get a Knife in the southeast and a Buckler Shield in the
northeast, but there's no point at all to get those items.  What's up with
putting basic equipment in later dungeons!? Follow the linear path to the
third floor. The southwest treasure chest contains the valuable Bolt
Javelin, which is guarded by Shade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shade
Hp: 3000 Mp: 240
Weakness: Cure
Reward: None
Attacks: Deth8, Curs8, Physical Attack (Curse)
Strategy: Have your primary curing characters cast cure on Shade if they
have level 6 or higher cure magic, it'll hit for 250-300 damage.  Guy's
Rune Axe will do 900 points of damage, so if he's your curing character,
just use him to attack. Frioniel and Richard should attack. Hopefully his
death spell won't obliterate your party, and he'll die within 10 turns.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the southeast exit.  The fourth floor contains some basic items;
there's a Heart in the southeast and a Valium in the west.  The southwest
room contains three canes, the Magic, Greed, and Evil Canes. Those in
hand, make your way to the northeast exit. The fifth floor has two
stairwells, not counting the entrance.  Take the northern one.  The
powerful Sun Sword in the southwest is guarded by a Q.Lamia and several
Krulls.  Stay alert for their confusion/paralysis spells and you'll be
fine.  Give the Sun Sword to Frioniel, and give the Defense Sword to
Richard.  Go on to the sixth floor. Take the three Elixirs from the
southwest room and return to the fifth floor. This time, take the
southwest stairs.  Head through the sixth and seventh floors.  On the
eight floor, ignore the central area for now and make your way to the
northwest corner.  Get the HellFire and WindFlut. De-equip Richard
completely, and head to the center area.  Head up and talk to Leonheart.
Maria will try to persuade him to join you, but he's been blinded by
power.  He says that the world is now his, but is cut off by a familiar
voice-the Emperor's!  Back from the dead, he tells Leonheart that his
mission is to make the world a living hell.  He begins to attack you, but
Richard holds him off while you fly off on the Hiryuu.  You can see
Paramekia change into a dark, hellish castle, Pandemonium.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER VI: REVENGE
=========================================================================
A.) The Sea of Jade
Enemies: Sphinx, Abysworm, G.Molbor, Dragon, Salamndr, Mantis, VmpLady,
IceLiz, M.Sucker, G.Dragon
Treasures: XCalibr, Hellfirex2, Icewind, Diamond Cane, CatClaw Knife, Rune
Axe, Fang, Aegis Shield, Holy Lance, Dragon Armor, Xpotionx2, Defense
Gauntlet
Bosses: B.Dragon, Behemoth, R.Dragon
=========================================================================

In Phin, you'll learn that the undead Emperor has resurrected the
root of all evil, the castle of hell, Pandemonium.  Unlike Paramekia,
Pandemonium cannot be accessed by air.  However, legends tell of a back
road, Jade, through which demons travel to reach the world from
Pandemonium. Learn the keyword Jade and say it to Raila, Hilda, and
Gordon.  Gordon tells you that something like that may exist south of
Kashuon...which is where the portal is.  First, equip Leonheart.  He's
left-handed, so put the Flame Shield in his right hand.  Give him the
Defense Sword.  Head for Dist. There, talk to Elina and say Dragoon.
She'll tell you that there are too many memories in Dist, and that she
wants to move on to another town.  But first, she gives you the XCalibr,
the supreme treasure of the Dragoons. Then Elina and her kid vanish for
good.  Give the XCalibr to Frioniel and give his Sun Sword to Leonheart.
Now, head to Mysidia and get Leonheart Change, Holy, Cure, Fire, Ice,
Bolt, Life, and Heal.  It's time to build up some stats, so go to an early
dungeon and change the enemies(the Bofsk Sewers or Semite Cave). All of
your characters should have at least 4000, preferably 5000 HP and your
mages should have 300 mp or more.  You should all have Weapon Skill levels
of 16, except for Leonheart (as that would take a long time to build-he
should have at least level 9 sword skill though).

When you're ready, head for Jade, which is far east of Mysidia (to the
west of the narrow strait a large distance south of Kashuon).  It looks
like a blue circle, as it is the Sea of Jade. You'll enter a watery area,
the first floor of Jade. Jade, for reasons unbeknownst to me, is packed to
the brim with treasure. On the first floor, you'll be able to grab the
Hellfire from the southwest and the Diamond Cane from the northeast.
However, as you probably don't use Canes, you can either pass up this
treasure chest, or grab it and sell it...your choice.  Head for the
staircase and descend to the second floor. In the northeast you can snatch
an Icewind, coupled with a Hellfire in the Northwest.  To the southwest
you'll find the CatClaw Knife, which is dutifully protected by the
B.Dragon, which sometimes drops the Dragon Armor and Holy Javelin, two
great treasures.  Don't worry if this B.Dragon doesn't drop them,
though.  You can also fight more later on (yes, they actually become
random encounters).  This is the best way to get three suits of Dragon
Armor (the R.Dragon drops it, but is tougher).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.Dragon
Hp: 3500 Mp: 240
Weakness: Posion (Aero)
Reward: 10000 Gil, Dragon Armor, Holy Javelin, Fang
Attacks: Bolt16, Physical Attack
Strategy: Blast this guy with high level8+ Aero spells or Tnad13 from
the WindFlut. Have Guy, Leonheart, and Frioniel attack, while Maria casts
black magic and cures after an occasional Bolt16.  The monstrous foe
hardly ever poses a severe threat, since you should be racking up
1000-2000 damage on it per turn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After butchering or avoiding the Bolt Dragon, head to the staircase and go
to the third floor. To the Northeast is a treasure you'll definitely want:
the Rune Axe (unless you got it already from the Generals in Paramekia, in
which case you can pass this up).  The Rune Axe is guarded by the Behemoth
(MegaBehemoth), who isn't as hard as he looks.  First, equip the Blood
Sword on Frioniel and Leonheart, since the MegaBehemoth takes a lot of
damage from the weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behemoth [MegaBehemoth]
Hp: 5000 Mp: 0
Weakness: None
Reward: 0 Gil, Yoichi Bow, Power Gauntlet, Power Armor, Spiral Helmet
Attacks: Physical Attack
Strategy: The quickest way to beat this foe is with your weapons.
Surprisingly, the Behemoth does not have an excellent defense, as one
would imagine.... Rather, his Magic Defense is substantially higher.  Just
hack him to pieces, since the Blood Sword does about 4200 damage on this
foe.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equip Guy with the Rune Axe.  It's interesting to note that there is a
magic shop behind the waterfall here, on the eastern side.  You can buy
some decent spells, such as Flare, Death, Haste, and Berserk.  Get Flare
for your characters that don't have it yet.  You can also sell the items
that you won't need, ex. CatClaw Knife.  My question: what's this salesman
doing here?  I might be wrong, but for a portal that opens every, oh, lets
say 500-1000 years, inhabited by demons, business must suck.  Head to
staircase and the next level. In the northwest, snatch the Fang (if you
want it), then head for the north room. Ignore the treasure chest in the
Northeast for now. In the room, you'll want to get the Aegis Shield, the
Dragon Armor, and the Holy Javelin. Head back to the main area of the 4th
floor.  Proceed to the Northeast.  Its time to slay the last Dragon. Equip
the IceWind on Maria, then open the treasure for a Yoichi Bow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
R.Dragon (Red Dragon)
Hp: 5000 Mp: 450
Weakness: Ice
Reward: 10000 Gil, Dragon Shield, Holy Javelin, Shoes, Dragon Armor
Attacks: Fire16, Physical Attack
Strategy: High end Ice spells would not hurt, but you need not drain your
mp here. Have your weakest attacker, probably Maria, blast the Dragon with
an IceWind.  In the meanwhile, your attackers should hack away at the foe.
Though harder than the B.Dragon (and the Dragon and G.Dragon), he should
go down within 6 turns.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give Maria the Yoichi Bow, and then head towards the staircase. Near the
entrance to the fifth floor is a sign telling you that Hell is near.
(Thanks for the directions, pal.  And by the way, who paid you to put the
sign there?) Anyway, grab the two Xpotions (northwest and northeast), you
may need them later.  Also grab the Defense Gauntlet (though it's not much
better than your current equipment; hopefully everyone already had Diamond
Gauntlets). Head for the sixth floor. There is really nothing on the sixth
floor, so head straight for the terrace are, where you'll be warped to
Pandemonium Castle.

=========================================================================
B.) Pandemonium
Enemies: Lamia, Q.Lamia, WolfDevl, BstDemon, MtGolem, DthRider, DvMantis,
Krull, DvFlower, G. Molbor, IceLiz, B. Dragon, R. Dragon, MegaBehemoth,
I.Gigas, F.Gigas, T.Gigas, Bomb, Worm, Salamndr, IceLiz, Giant
Treasures: Ether, EyeDrop, Masmune Sword, Genji Gauntlet, Genji Helmet,
Genji Armor, Ribbon Helmet, ElderIQ, HellFire, DrgnBean
Bosses: Z.Borgan, Tiamat, Satan, Asteroth, Emperor
=========================================================================

There is no treasure on the first floor, and don't try to walk into the
Gates (they look like a row of doors).  Just follow the normal path to the
exit. On the second floor, you can pick up on Ether to the north as you
again follow the path.  It's interesting to note that packs of Lamias,
Q.Lamias, and Krulls drop Ribbon Helms, a heavily guarded treasure later
in the castle. The third floor of Pandemonium is still straightforward,
but you can grab some EyeDrops if you want in the Southwest.  There's a
passage in the center of an L shaped hallway which leads to the EyeDrops.
The fourth floor, however, is quite different from the others.  It has
four doors, each leading to a convoluted passage with a treasure in it.
First, take the westernmost door.  Follow the passage.  You'll see a
treasure, but don't open it just yet. Instead, follow the path for a while
longer.  You'll have to walk through a wall or two on the way as you
progress northeast, so don't pass that off as a bug in the game.  These
walls will eventually lead you to another room with a treasure.  Snatch
the Masmune sword, and give it to Frioniel.  Give Leonheart Frioniel's
XCalibr.  Armed with the Masmune, it's time for you to do some treasure
hunting.

*The Masmune's room contains some tough monsters, the MegaBehemoth,
B.Dragon, and R.Dragon.  These monsters also drop powerful treasure, but
you might want to reserve the treasure hunting spirit until you get some
better armor.*

Trace your way back to the first treasure.  Open it for a Genji
Gauntlet. Zombie Borgan, however, doesn't want you to keep that...it's
time to put that idiotic Imperial to rest, for good.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Z. Borgan
Hp: 2500 Mp: 370
Weakness: Fire, Cure
Reward: 2000 Gil
Attacks: Flar16, Physical Attack (Paralysis)
Strategy: With the Masmune in hand, this fight should be a piece of cake.
Have Frioniel use the Masmune to Hast11 the party, and have everyone else
attack. Unless you are very unlucky, and Z. Borgan manages to paralyze
your big attackers (Leonheart and Frioniel), this fight shouldn't last over
3 rounds, I killed him in two hits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give the Genji Gauntlet to Maria. Now, progress to the second room from
the west.  Follow the path to the northwest, where you'll find a treasure
chest, and make sure you have good weapons equipped.  Open the treasure
chest to get the Genji Helmet and fight Tiamat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiamat
Hp: 5000 Mp: 450
Weakness: None
Reward: 10000 Gil
Attacks: Fire16, Bolt16, Mist16, Ice16, Physical Attack(Poison)
Strategy: This is not a magic fight, since Fire, Bolt, Mist, Ice, and Aero
heal Tiamat. Theoretically, Flare and Ultima will hurt him, but that would
waste precious MP.  Instead, Hast11 everyone with Frioniel, have Maria as a
reserve Healer, and butcher Tiamat with relentless physical attacks. Do it
fast, as Tiamat's elemental spells can rack up some heavy hp loss.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now take the easternmost door. In the north is a treasure chest guarded by
Satan.  Open it for the Genji Armor, then prepare to kill the devil.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satan
Hp: 5000 Mp: 450
Weakness: None
Reward: 10000 Gil
Attacks: Fire16, Flar16, Chrm16, Blnk16, Dspl16, Ston16, Physical
Attack(Poison)
Strategy: Again, this is not a magic fight.  Rather than waste mp on
Ultima or Holy, begin attacking immediately.  This time, its not worth it
to use the Masmune with Frioniel, because Beelzebub can induce crippling
status effects on your entire party if you wait too long.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the second door from the east.  Follow the path until you see a
Treasure chest.  This chest contains the Ribbon, a fairly strong helmet.
It Offers protection against status effects and elemental attacks, but
lacks in defense. However, this treasure is guarded by Asteroth,
the incredibly difficult Dark Lord.  If you are up to the challenge, that
is, have over 2500 hp for every character (not max, current) and suitable
mp, then you can try it.  In my opinion, the ArchAngel is harder than the
last boss, and the equipment he has is not worth the fight; you can get
the same helm if you keep beating up Krulls and Q.Lamias.  It's your
choice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asteroth
Hp: 7000 Mp: 540
Weakness: None
Reward: 10000 Gil
Attacks: Aero16, Blnd16, Dran16, Fire16, Physical Attack
Strategy: Use Frioniel's Masmune to Hast11 the party.  Ultima with Maria,
and attack with Guy and Leonheart. The next turn, attack with Frioniel and
Leonheart.  If needed, heal with Guy, else attack.  If Maria doesn't need
to heal, cast Ultima. If you are lucky, Asteroth won't physically
attack you or blind Frioniel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Asteroth slaughtered (or avoided), your party has gained the last of
The great treasures of Pandemonium.  With the exception of several items
to Be procured along the path to the final boss, you've gotten everything
the Dungeon has to offer.  Now, you're faced with an important decision:
exit the dungeon, save, stock up on ethers/elixirs, etc., or move on to
face the final boss. Yes, trekking through Jade and Pandemonium again will
be boring and arduous. But it would be better than having to reclaim all
the treasure again if you, say, lost to the final boss. Anyway, I exited
and recuperated...others may choose differently. After defeating Asteroth,
head to the warp in the south corner of the room.  The fifth floor is
straightforward, as is floor six.  On floor six grab the ElderIQ in the
north.  On the seventh floor, treat yourself to a Hellfire in the
southeast and a DrgnBean in the northwest.  From here, move on to the 8th
floor.  The warp is in the southwest corner.

On floor nine lurks the Emperor, reborn from hell. This Astral Plane also
is home to R.Dragons, B.Dragons, MegaBehemoths, T.Gigases, I.Gigases,
F.Gigases, and Bombs. Don't get to close to him, or the battle with start.
Instead, pause, and check your equipment:

EQUIPMENT CHECK 1: NO BLOOD SWORDS
*Frioniel should have the Masmune Sword equipped, along side an Aegis
Shield, Genji Armor, Diamond Helmet, Diamond Gauntlets, Bacchus, and an
Elixir.  He should have over 5000 hp, a level 16 sword and shield skill
level.

*Maria should have the Yoichi Bow, Ice Shield, Diamond Armor, Diamond
Helmet, Genji Gauntlet, and 2 Elixirs. She should have over 4000 hp and
300 mp, an Ultima of level 12 or higher, and a Cure of level 11 or higher.

*Guy should have the Rune Axe, Diamond Shield, Diamond Armor, Diamond
Helmet, Diamond Gauntlet, and 2 Elixirs. He should have over 5000 hp and
300 mp, and a Cure spell of level 11 or higher.

*Leonheart should have the XCalibr Sword, Flame Shield, Diamond Armor,
Flame Helmet, Diamond Gauntlet, a Bacchus, and 2 Elixirs. He should have
over 4500 hp, a level 10 sword and shield skill level.

EQUIPMENT CHECK 2: 1 OR 2 BLOOD SWORDS
*Frioniel should have the Blood Sword equipped, along side an Aegis Shield,
Genji Armor, Diamond Helmet, Diamond Gauntlet, Bacchus Wine, and an
Elixir.

*Maria should have the Yoichi Bow, Diamond Armor, Diamond Helmet, Genji
Gauntlet, and 2 Elixirs.

*Guy should have the Rune Axe, Diamond Shield, Diamond Armor, Diamond
Helmet, Diamond Gauntlet, a Masmune and an Elixir.

*Leonheart should have the XCalibr Sword, Flame, Diamond Armor, Genji
Helmet, Diamond Gauntlet, a Bacchus, and an Elixir.

EQUIPMENT CHECK 3: OPTIMAL EQUIPMENT
*Frioniel should have the Blood Sword equipped, along side an Aegis Shield,
Genji Armor, Genji Helmet, Genji Gauntlet, Bacchus Wine, and an Elixir.

*Maria should have the Yoichi Bow, Genji Armor, Genji Helmet, Genji
Gauntlet, and 2 Elixirs.

*Guy should have the Rune Axe, Dragon Shield, Genji Armor, Genji Helmet,
Genji Gauntlet, a Masmune and an Elixir.

*Leonheart should have the XCalibr Sword, Dragon Shield, Genji Armor,
Genji Helmet, Genji Gauntlet, a Bacchus, and an Elixir.

When you are ready, go ahead and talk to him.  Get ready...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*FINAL BOSS: EMPEROR*
Hp: 10000 Mp:???
Attacks: Meteo1, Blnd16, Curs16, Dspl16, Flar16, Slow16, Physical Attack

*Strategy 1: No Blood Swords* This strategy may be a little risky in the
sense that it puts your main attacker, Frioniel, out of the picture or two
rounds, but it is also a nearly insurmountable method of defeating the
Emperor.  Here's how it goes:

(1) Frioniel uses the Masmune to cast Hast11 on the party. Maria uses the
Yoichi Bow to Bsrk3 the party. Guy attacks the Emperor Leonheart uses the
a Bacchus

(2) Frioniel uses the Bacchus to enhance his attack. Maria casts Ultima12
or higher on the Emperor, or Cures the party (after Meteo), or Cures a
single character that's been attacked Guy attacks the Emperor, or Cures a
single character that's been attacked. Leonheart attacks the Emperor, uses
an Elixir if it fits the situation.

(3) On turn three, Frioniel attacks, uses an Elixir if necessary (though
that will severely hinder the regicide process).  The rest of the party
repeats the above strategy. Frioniel's attack should do 2400+ damage.

Up to this point, the Emperor, if everyone could attack, should have
suffered 1800 damage.  The point? It should take 5 turns, including the
initial one, to defeat this foe.

*Strategy 2: 2 Blood Swords*
(1) Frioniel uses the Bacchus, Maria uses the Yoichi Bow to cast Bsrk3, Guy
uses the Masmune to cast Hast11, and Leonheart uses the Bacchus

(2) Everyone attacks. Frioniel should kill the Emperor in one hit (for me,
he did 11728 damage, displayed as 1728).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sit back and watch a well-earned but not too great ending.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV.) WEAPONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Final Fantasy 2j, there are seven kinds of weapons your characters can
use. Each character can use any weapon s/he pleases.  However, once you
start using one kind of weapon, you're better off sticking to it. Each
time you use a weapon, or more precisely, each time you choose "Fight",
you gain 1 weapon skill point.  After 100 points are gained, the character
gains a weapon skill level.  As the skill level goes up, your character
will deal more damage by hitting the enemy more times. The max skill
level, 16, will allow your characters to hit the enemy 16 times.  Note: 16
is not the maximum number of hits one of your characters can do, since a
hasted character with Lv. 16 weaponry can deal up to 20 hits or more. To
quickly build weapon levels, select fight, cancel, then select fight
again.  This works for the first three characters; to get the fourth
character to a high weapon level, get into lots of fights, and prolong
them, allowing the fourth character to attack ten times per fight.  After
10 fights, they should gain 1 level.  Different enemies yield different
exp points per hit, based on your weapon level.


The seven weapons you can use are axes, bows, canes, fists, javelins,
knives, and swords.  If you don't have a bow equipped, then you can't hit
the enemy from the back row, unless you use magic.  I usually equip my
characters in this fashion: Frioniel-Swords, Maria-Bows, Guy-Axes,
Leonheart-Swords.  NPCs can be equipped with whatever suits them best or
the most powerful weapon on hand (in most cases, the former is the better
choice).

1.) Axes: Axes are physically stronger than swords for the majority of the
game, since high-powered Axes can be bought early on, whereas high-power
swords are usually found.  The strongest Axe is the fourth strongest
weapon in the game.

2.) Bows: Bows are useful since they allow attack without fear of
retaliation.  However, equipping a character with a Bow means no Shield
can be equipped.  This means that the character will have minimum agility,
making them slow.  Natural HP growth will also be smaller.  The strongest
Bow is the fourth most powerful weapon in the game, and has a very useful
"in-battle" use.

3.) Canes: Canes are good for their "as item" uses and are also decent
weapons.  However, they are weaker than Bows and do not provide protection
from physical attacks.  The strongest Cane is the fifth strongest weapon in
the game.

4.) Fists: Fists are the most accurate weapons in the game, and are also
the cheapest.  Fist attack power increases by 8 per level of Fist above
1, so with Pwr. 99 and Fist level 16, the attack power of the
Fists is 169 (second strongest in the game).  However, if you have a
Shield equipped, the character will attack with the Shield and gain
experience for the Shield only.  So, to maximize Fist power, you can't
have Shields equipped.

5.) Javelins: Javelins are fairly strong, but like Canes they are not as
effective as Bows on the longterm scale.  The strongest Javelin is the
fifth most powerful weapon in the game.

6.) Knives: Knives are very accurate, but are also incredibly weak.  Their
low cost and accuracy do not make up for their lack of solid power.  The
strongest Knife is the sixth strongest weapon in the game.

7.) Swords: Swords are very accurate and powerful.  Basically, they are
the most powerful weapons in the game.  The strongest Sword is the
strongest weapon in the game and also has a very useful "as item" use.

V.) SHIELDS <explanation courtesy of Alex Jackson>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shields level up like weapons do, but function in an entirely different
way. Shields play a large role in determing evasion capabilities.  Each
shield has a raw evade rating, which is listed below.  The shield's total
contribution to your evade rating is (level of shield)(raw evade rating).
Fore example, if you have a level 16 Aegis Shield, its total contribution
towards your evade would be 16x20%, which is 320% (listed as 99%).

-------->SPECIAL MAGIC<--------

The spells Aura, Heal, Barrier, and Dispel gain new abilities for each
level they gain.  Barrier level 16, for example, will offer Ice, Crt. Hit,
Posion, Death, Bolt, Soul, and Fire Defense, while Barrier level 1 will
only offer Ice defense.  Below is a list of this progression.

LEVEL:  AURA         HEAL              BARRIER          DISPEL
1       White Aura   Rmvs Dark/Poison  Ice Def    				  Ice defense down
2       Yellow Aura  Rmvs Curse        Critical Hit Def Body defense down
3       Green Aura   Rmvs Dumb         Poison Def       Poison defense down
4       Black Aura   Rmvs Toad         Death Def        Prot defense down
5       Blue Aura    Rmvs Stone        Bolt Def         Bolt defense down
6       Orange Aura  Rmvs Death        Soul Def         Soul defense down
7       Red Aura                       Fire Def         Fire defense down
8                                                       Change defense down

-------->THEORY ON AURA<--------

Below is my theory on how Aura works.  As Aura gains levels, it changes
your character's color.  Below are what I think the colors do (you may
notice that they corrolate with the levels of Barrier/Dispel):

White Aura: Turns a character white, giving them Ice elemental attack.

Yellow Aura: Turns a character yellow, giving them more Critical Hit
chance.

Green Aura: Turns a character green, giving them Poison status attack.

Black Aura: Turns a character black, giving them Death status attack.

Blue Aura: Turns a character blue, giving them Bolt elemental attack.

Orange Aura: Turns a character orange, giving them Soul elemental attack.

Red Aura: Turns a character red, giving them Fire elemental attack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
X.) STATISTICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two kinds of statistics in FFII, raw statistics and function
statistics. They are listed below.  For more information, see the Building
Your Characters and Tricks sections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.) Raw Statistics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agl: Agility determines how fast a character completes an action and
Determines evasion. It can be increased by evading attacks (i.e. equipping
a shield).

Hit Points: Hit Points determine the amount of damage a character can take
before dying.  They are increased by losing over 1/2 your HP in a battle.

Int: Intelligence determines the power of black magic spells.  To raise
it, simply cast a black magic spell several times in one fight (5-100
times, depending on the enemy and the magic's skill level).

Magic Points: Magic Points determine the number of magic spells a
character can cast.  They are increased by losing over 1/2 your MP in a
battle.

M.Pwr: Magic Power determines the amount of Magic Points gained after a
battle, provided that the criteria outlined above has been met.

Magic Skill Level: The amount of damage that a spell does and its
effectiveness is determined by the spell's magic skill level.  To raise it
one level, cast the spell 100 times.

Pwr: Power determines the amount of damage a characters physical attacks
will do.  To increase Pwr, attack several times in a battle (from 5-100
times, depending on the enemy and weapon skill level).  Frequently, an
increase in weapon level comes hand in hand.

Soul: Soul determines the power of white magic spells.  To raise Soul,
cast white magic several times in one fight (5-100 times, depending on the
enemy and the magic's skill level).  It frequently increases with a Cane
Weapon level up.

Vit: Vitality determines HP gains and M. Pwr.  To raise Vit, lose a lot of
HP in a fight.

Weapon Skill: This determines the amount of hits that your weapon
inflicts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.) Function Statistics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Att: Attack determines the amount of damage your character can inflict on
An enemy.

Def: Defense determines the amount of damage an enemy's physical attack
can do to you.

Evad: Evade determines your ability to dodge an enemy's physical attack.

Hit %: Hit Percent determines the chance that your attack will hit the
enemy. The left number represents how many hits you can make, and the
right Number represents the chance that they will connect.

M.Def: Magic Defense determines your ability to resist Magic.  It is
affected by vitality and magic power.  The left number represents how many
magical attacks will be ineffective (in a given battle) and the right
number determines the chance of evading those magical attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XI.) FORMULAE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several important formulae in this game.  Here is a partial list
of them.

Inn Price: (.25)H + M
H: HP lost
M: MP lost

Weapon Skill Points gained: U-L+X
U is the number of times the weapon is used
L is the level of the weapon
X is a pre-determined constant for a set of monsters [See bestiary]

Evade Rate: Agl + (R)(x) + (L)(y) - A
R is the evade rate of the right hand weapon
L is the evade rate of the left hand weapon
x is the skill level of the right hand weapon
y is the skill level of the left hand weapon.
A is the sum of the evade rates of the armor the character has.

Hit% = (Power+80) + W
W is the raw weapon hit % (I've yet to get all of this data, but I'm
pretty sure this formula is right).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XII.) SECRETS/TRICKS/MISC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.) Change Trick
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change is the most powerful spell in the game.  Level it up as soon as you
can To level 5 or higher.  Then, begin to cast it on weak enemies like
Goblins. The point?  Well, a Goblin has 6 HP and 0 MP.  Switching stats
with one will cause HP, VIT, SOUL, MP, and M. PWR increases.  IMHO, this
is MUCH more effective then beating up your own characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.) Weapons/Magic Skills Made Easy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weapon and Magic Skill points are awarded each time you select a target to
attack or each time you select a target to cast magic on.  So, if you
select Fight, pick a target, cancel, and repeat, you'll gain 1 (A) point.
The same goes with magic. Each enemy will give you a certain number of (B)
points per attack made on them.  The number of (B) points acquired in
relation to your (A) points determines how many skill points you get after
the fight. The moral? Weapons will easily level to 4, stay stagnant, then
level up to 2, stay stagnant, then level up to 16.  So, whenever you sense
the monsters will give you skill points, simply pull the trick 100 times
to get a skill level. *Note: By going to advanced dungeons early, you may
get slightly higher sword levels then suggested above.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.) Blood Sword <Courtesy of Yoichi>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two Blood Swords in Final Fantasy 2.  Blood Swords have 0 attack
power, and are useless for the majority of the game.  However, the Blood
Swords do incredible amounts of damage to the final boss. I've killed the
last boss in one hit with the Blood Sword, so it's a good idea to keep
both Blood Swords ready for the last foe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.) Mysidia's Bookcase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The northeastern book case in the southwestern Mysidian house (wow that
sounds weird) contains a book case that holds some interesting
information. It responds to many keywords, giving you the background
information on SunFlame, Goddess Bell, etc.  They are listed below: Jade:
When Pandemonium First terrorized our land, demons used Jade as a transit
between worlds.

Mask: Both masks will be utilized on the path to finding the Rod of
legend. The White Mask's destiny lies with a maiden of solid stone...Black
with the likeness of a drone.

Ultima: Long ago, the sacred mages created a strong spell to contain
Pandemonium.  They sealed the ultimate magic in a giant tower, fearing its
power afterwards.

Mysidia: Mages from long ago knew the power of Ultima.  The magic they
created was so strong, they feared they themselves would ruin the world by
fighting over its power.  So they formed Mysidia as a haven and migrated
there in peace.

Hiryuu: Hiryuus were trained to fight for the Dragoons.  They can carry
many people and items.

Dragoon: The tower of Dist used to be a den of Hiryuus.  One Knight by the
name of Haan spent 30 years to retain friendship with the Hiryuus. He
became the first Dragoon.

Goddess Bell: Long ago, a wealthy king ordered an unbreakable lock,
because his treasure had often been stolen.  The first lock was broken in
a day.  The second lock was broken in two days.  But, the third lock was
never broken.  The King hid the only known key, now known as the Goddess
Bell, deep within an icy cave.  The Bell's sweet sound can open any lock.

Sun Flame: In a time before castles or countries a star fell upon the land
where Kashuon exists now.  One man harnessed the burning core of the star.
He created an altar and worshipped it there.  As humanity progressed, a
castle was built around it as a sign of power.

Airship: Such is the way technology flows...If society keeps progressing,
magic will one day die out.

Mithril: This magical metal can be found deep within the earth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.) FFII in FFIX!?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) The Story of Joseph <Courtesy of Bob the Almighty> At one point in
FFIX, you'll have to piece together the Story of Joseph. Here it is:

"Beginning: Once upon a time, 33 small countries fought together against
an empire. One day, a rebel troop visited a man named Joseph, who lived
this his daughter. Owing a debt to the troop, he gladly accepted their
plea for help. They headed for a cavern in the snow field.

Cooperation: With Joseph's help, the troop defeated the Adamantoise in the
snow field cavern and acquired the Goddess Bell they needed to enter the
empire's castle.

Silence: On their way home, they fell into a trap set by a traitor. Joseph
gave his life to save the troop. The troop left without telling Joseph's
daughter, Nelly, about the tragedy.

Historian's explanation (Hero): Although Joseph's death was not reported
to his daughter, the manner of his death speaks for itself. This is the
story of a true hero.

Historian's explanation (Human): The fact that they didn't report Joseph's
death to his daughter was indicative of their guilt for failing to protect
him. In the end, heroes are also human." ****** Hero outcome: Ramuh: Let
me ask you one thing... How come you chose 'Hero' for the conclusion?

Garnet: People follow a person who keeps on track. That's why I think a
hero who acts in a straightforward manor is remembered for generations.

Ramuh: ...I want to know what you think, in your own words.

Garnet: Me...? I ran away from my country, but I haven't forgotten about
my people...

Ramuh: ...Your soul is very tense right now. Maybe you'll begin to relax
once I become your eidolon...

Garnet: Thank you.

Ramuh: There are many paths. Remember that you alone choose the path on
which you walk. ***** Human outcome: Ramuh: Let me ask you one thing...
How come you chose 'Human' for the conclusion?

Garnet: People pass down stories of other people to whom they feel an
affinity. The people in the story had flaws, as we all do. That is why
they became heroes in the people's mind.

Ramuh: ...I want to know what you think, in your own words.

Garnet: Me...? I ran away from my country, but I haven't forgotten about
my people...

Ramuh: ...Your soul is very tense right now. Maybe you'll begin to relax
once I become your eidolon...

Garnet: Thank you.

Ramuh: There are many paths. Remember that you alone choose the path on
which you walk."-FFIX

2.) Ming-Wu <Courtesy of Bob the Almighty>

There, that was pretty interesting, eh? But there is another interesting
reference to FFII in IX. In Gizamaluke's Grotto, you can obtain the Holy
Bell Key Item (which in itself is similar to the Goddess Bell).  If you
look at the text on the bell, you'll see this quote from Philosopher Minu
(Minu being a translation of Ming-Wu): "We seek the meaning of life
because we are mortal."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.) LIGHT WARRIORS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After capturing Phin from Commander Gotus, take a trip around the town.
One person will say: "WARRIORS, REVIVE THE POWER OF THE ORBS!", a quote
from Final Fantasy.  Guy'll tell him to shut up afterwards.  He disappears
after the Whirlwind incident.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.) PENINSULA SOUTH OF ALTEA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like Final Fantasy's 'Peninsula Northeast of Pravoka', FFII has an
area early in the game where powerful monsters appear.  If you walk
directly south of Altea until you reach the tip of the peninsula, and then
walk around.  You can face advanced Mysidian enemies, like Puddings,
Mallows, and Brains here, which is a good way to build up your weapon
levels, if you survive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.) MASMUNE ROOM/ASTRAL PLANE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both of these areas are home to some tough enemies (the Astral Plane is
the final floor of Pandemonium). This is a good place to go hunting for
extra suits of Dragon Armor and extra Dragon Shields. You may also luck
out and get a Yoichi Bow from the MegaBehemoths lurking around.  If you
want to be optimally equipped, and missed the Dragon Armor or Shield, this
is the only way to get extra sets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.) GIANTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Giants are probably the rarest enemy in the game, but they also have the
best equipment to drop.  They are located on the orange floor of
Pandemonium castle, in the northeast courtyard.  They appear relatively
often if you hang around in that area, but I've never fought them
elsewhere (even on that floor).  Giants usually attack for about 500-1500
damage, then run away.  Occasionally, they'll use Mist16 on the whole
party.  The real secret is that when you beat them, they drop all three
Genji Armors and XCaliburs (not in the same battle, obviously).
Basically, if you want to get the best stuff in the game, kill these guys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XIII.) FAQ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you'll find answers to frequently asked questions. They are basically
paraphrased versions of emails I receive or questions that I bet I'll
recieve.

Q. Can I change the order of the characters? Like switch Guy with Frioniel?
A. No, you can only change their row.

Q. What's the deal with magic!? Ultima sucks, I mean, what the hell? I
take the trouble to level it up to max, and it deals 500 damage?  Geez.
A. The only times i really recommend leveling up spells are: Aero for the
T.Gigas (before the Tower of Mysidia), Change for stat-building, and Heal
for the annoying status effects before/in the Tower of Mysidia. Though
having the high level elemental spells can come in handy too; Fire8 at the
I.Gigas or Dragon, Bolt8 at the G.Dragon, and Ice8 at the F.Gigas and
R.Dragon. Haste is an awesome spell but you'll eventually get the Masmune
which has Hast11. Berserk is good but the Yoichi Bow has Berserk3, and
Flare or Holy are not really worth it.  As you said, they deal max 500-900
damage to enemies where you'd think magic could help.

Q. What's going on with those battle items? They suck worse than magic!
A. Yeah, battle items are definitely useless, with a few notable
exceptions. Bacchus Wine is good, the Hiryuu Flute can be useful
(infinite uses), and the high-level elemental attacks (Earth Drum, Wind
Flute, Ice Wind) can come in usefull at some bosses.  The Eggtimer is only
useful if you want to stop annoying enemies before they use spells like
Death.  If I were you, i would sell all other battle items.

Q. Hey, how come it says "Soul up" and "Pwr up" while I already have 99 of
those attributes?
A. It just does that...for really no apparent reason, I guess.  You may
have noticed weapons level going up, even though you're already at 16.
Same deal.

Q. So you're telling me that only Swords, Axes, and Bows are useful as
weapons?
A. Yes=).  Despite the general uselessness of magic, you'll still need one
powerful mage.  It's advisable that you keep that mage character in the
back row, out of harms way.  Now, for them to attack, they need a bow.  As
for Swords and Axes, they are the most powerful weapons in the game, and
are fairly accurate.

Q. How about Fists, Spears, Knives, and Canes?
A. Canes are only good for their "as-item" uses, such as Aero16 from the
Evil Cane.  Knives are the weakest of the weapons.  Spears are strong, but
not stronger than axes or swords.  Knives just aren't very good. As for
fists, you'll have a good hit% and high power, but, again, it's easier to
attain high power through other weapons.

Q. Is it possilbe to do a solo quest?
A. Yes.  Once you gain control of your characters, give the Axe to
Frioniel. Sell Guy and Maria's equipment, and get the Leather Helm for
Frioniel. Kill Maria and Guy off in a battle, and don't revive them. The
excess money you have should be used to buy Fire and Cure for Frioniel.
Next, get his weapon skill level up to 3 or 4, the hard way.  In addition,
you should shoot for Lv.2 Cure or Fire.  Proceed with the game until you
get Ming-Wu. Give the Copper Armor to Frioniel, and sell everything else Ming-Wu
has [kill Ming-Wu off in a battle].  Now comes the hard part.  Build up
Frioniel's Hp to 200+ and his Mp to 50+, at least.  Buy both Bolt and Ice
for Frioniel, and level them up to level 2.  Now, take the time to gather
14400-15000 gil, which I guarantee will take a while, and buy at least
8-10 potions (use the items spaces that the dead guys have for extra
space).

Head to Poft, where you can either fly to Kashuon for 400 gil or conserve
money and make the long trek there.  From Kashuon, head to the Chocobo
Forest and ride to Mysidia (southwest of Altea-quite a distance).

Here, buy the Knight Armor, Thief Gauntlet, and Change spell for Frioniel.
Sell his old armor.  The hardest part is making the trek, by foot, back to
safety at Altea.  Blast Puddings with Fire and Mallows with Bolt.  Once
there, cast Change on the Goblins, building your HP and MP greatly (you'll
probably need change level 5+ for a 80%+ chance).  When you need to refill
hp/mp, rest at the Inn (if you have financial trouble, try fighting harder
enemies on the peninsula directly south of Altea).  Keep building
Frioniel's HP/MP until he has over a 1000 or so HP and 100 MP.

When you feel ready, beat up the enemies on the peninsula south of Altea
for cash and weapon skill.  Once you get over 21000 gil, head back to
Mysidia and buy the Ogre Axe and Ice Shield.  With the Ogre Axe in hand, you're
set for a long time.  Use the Ogre Axe to garner cash you can use to rest
at the inn while repeating the Change trick.  Use this trick until you are
5000+ Hp and 500+ Mp.  With this, you're set for the game.

My only suggestions for Jade/Pandemonium is to level up the Blood Sword to
lv 10+ as soon as possible.  Also, only get the Masmune and potentially
the Ribbon treasures. Yes, it will take a long time to get the initial
21000 gil, and even more time to get a lot of HP, but then gradually less
time to get more gil for the Ogre Axe/Ice Shield, and even less time
breezing through the first half of the game, not even needing to get the
treasures.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XIV.) BESTIARY

The reward section is not focused on gil, but on the items that monster
may drop.  However, for some bosses, I included gil as well.
