IV. PLAYSTATION CHANGES
=============================================================================

Final Fantasy:
-Graphics and sound have been upgraded to 16 bit quality. The graphics are 
based on the WonderSwan Color version of the game, with a few touch-ups, such 
as increased resolution and Mode 7 support.
-A brand new FMV has been added allowing the player to see a scene from the 
game in super-realistic graphics.
-New music for boss battles and churches have been added.
-The menu system is easier to navigate.
-You can choose either normal mode or easy mode. The easy mode makes the 
game extremely easy compared to its Famicom counterpart. Changes include 
cheaper shop prices better level-up statistics, and easier battles.
-The auto target feature prevents characters from attacking dead monsters.
-The Dash feature increases walking speed in towns and dungeons.
-As you progress through the game, you will unlock an Omake mode, which 
provides information on monsters, towns, and dungeons; it also allows you 
to view media from the game. You must complete the game on both easy and
normal mode to unlock everything.

Final Fantasy II:
-Audio and visuals have been upgraded to 16 bit standards. Like Final 
Fantasy, the updates are based on the WonderSwan Color version of the game, 
with a few touch-ups.
-The game's system has been tweaked in order to make it easier. Spells and 
weapons are much more accurate, and status ailments are far less effective 
for enemies.
-Boss music has been added for each boss; however, the original boss music 
has been removed and replaced by a new one.
-Color palettes have been changed in favor of a more realistic look. For 
example, the Dreadnought is now metal instead of wooden.
-A brand new FMV has been added to enhance the visual experience.
-The battle system has been cleaned up; however, you can still attack 
yourself to gain HP and attack and cancel to gain skill levels.
-A Dash feature has been added to increase walking speed.
-The Auto Target feature prevents characters from attacking dead monsters.
-Item space has been upgraded from 32 from the original to 63.
-Items, equipment, and spells now have icons that tell what they are.
-As you progress through the game, you will unlock an Omake mode, which 
provides information on monsters, towns, and dungeons; it also allows you 
to view media from the game.

Press O and START together to view the overworld map. If you are on easy 
mode, press the O button to dash in towns and dungeons. Enter the town and 
go shopping for goods. Try to balance out your purchases, don't spend all 
your money on equipment and none on magic. You should buy at least one 
Cure spell and one attack spell for your mages. Enter the castle and speak 
to the king on the top floor. When your characters are equipped and ready 
to fight, you should leave town and level up to at least level 3. Once you 
feel confident, head north to the ruined temple. Be wary on the way there, 
there are many strong monsters.

2. Temple of Chaos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

as desired. North east of Pravoca is a peninsula where extremely powerful 
enemies abide. Travel to this peninsula in order to rack up huge amounts of 
experience early in the game. You should be at least level 5 and have 
Dia and Fire spells for your mages. Now that you have your ship you can 
access a hidden puzzle game. To get it, get on your ship and hold down X and

There are several new upper level spells and weapons available here. Talk to

Demons to get the Crown. There is locked door south of this room, ignore it 
for now. Exit the Marsh Cave and travel north to the Western Keep.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Western Keep
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

the two locked doors for treasure. Travel to the Western Keep and open the
locked door for treasure. Finally, go back to the Marsh Cave and travel

to sail out of the Cornelian Bay.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Melmond
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Land on the port west of the Mt. Duergar to reach Melmond. You will notice

both paths. Save time by taking the right path first, and be sure to pick up

the best spells in the game. Talk to all of the Lufenian people and you'll

XV. WALKTHROUGH
=============================================================================

***Introduction to Final Fantasy II's unique game mechanics***
This game's system is untraditional compared to other FFs; however, it is 
very logical and unique. Stats are gained individually by how often they are 
used. If you lose a lot of HP in battle, then you'll most likely gain HP. 
Use a lot of MP in battle to gain more. Use weapons to gain strength, magic 
for magic power, etc. Also, the inn system is untraditional in this game, 
costs are determined like this: one Gil per MP and one Gil for four HP. To 
revive dead characters, take them to a goddess statue in a town.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Altair
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Potion.

The game will begin with the party, Firion, Maria, Gus, and Leon, 
running from the empire's soldiers. An un-winnable battle will commence and 
all of your characters will die within the first few rounds. Firion will 
be revived by Mindu and Hilda, the leader of a small rebellion against the 
empire. Firion will meet Maria and Gus on his way to the throne room, but 
Leon is nowhere to be found. Enter the throne room and talk to Hilda 
twice. She'll give you the Wild Rose password, to learn it, click on the 
highlighted password using the Memorize command. Collect treasure in 
the rebel base and exit to the town. Before venturing out, I would suggest 
buying at least a Cure spell. Take note of what weapons your characters are 
equipped with and change them according to what you want them to master. 
Travel outside and gain HP for a while and prepare to infiltrate Fynn Castle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Fynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Potion ×3, Ring, Canoe.

From Altair travel north. On your way you'll find a small town just below 
the crescent shaped lake. This town is called Gatrea, it's rather small and 
has few new items to offer in its stores. Stay in the inn if needed and 
continue on your journey northward. Walk into the center of the crescent 
shaped lake and enter the town. This is Fynn, and it's been invaded by the 
Paramecian empire. Don't talk to any of the soldiers or they'll attack you 
and you'll be thrown into an un-winnable battle. There are normal battles in 
the village as well, but they shouldn't pose too much threat. None of the 
houses or shops are inhabited at the moment. Walk north and go east along 
the perimeter of the outer wall to reach the Pub. Talk to the bar tender and 
tell him the Wild Rose password by using the Ask command. Walk into the 
basement behind the bar and talk to the dying man on the bed. His name is 
Scott, and he was the ruler of Kas'ion before it was destroyed by the empire.
He is also the older brother of Gordon, who you may or may not have met in 
Altair, and he is in love with Hilda. Before he dies, he uses the last of his 
strength to give you a Ring to give to Hilda. The Ring will allow you to 
view a world map by pressing O and Start together. Return to Altair and tell 
Hilda the sad news by showing her the Ring with the Items command, she'll 
insist that you keep it. She will then teach you a new password, Mythril. 
She explains that if you can find this ore, Tobul, the blacksmith, will weld 
Mythril equipment, making your rebellion a little bit stronger. Mindu will 
join you. He is a very powerful White Mage with almost every White Magic 
spell available. He will also give you a Canoe, making it possible to travel 
to Semmit Falls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Semmit Falls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 10 Gil, 200 Gil, 530 Gil, 1 Gil, Antidote, Potion ×2, Fire, 
Warp, Mythril.

Cross the lake just north of Altair to reach Paloom. This town offers some 
new equipment, but I would recommend waiting until you reach Salamand before 
buying any new equipment. Talk to the sailor at the entrance of the town and 
pay 32 Gil for a boat trip to the next town. This town is called Poft. 
You'll find Cid in the Pub, and you can learn the Airship password from him.
His assistant will give you Airship rides to the areas outlined below:
Bafsk - 100 Gil
Salamand - 200 Gil
Semmit Falls - 300 Gil
Kas'ion - 400 Gil
You can take the Airship straight to Semmit Falls from here, but I would 
recommend stopping by Salamand first for some really great spells and 
equipment. In the freezing town of Salamand you'll learn that the 
town's men are trapped in Semmit Falls. Stay at the inn and buy new 
equipment. Stock up on curative items and do some last minute leveling
up before heading west to Semmit Falls. Navigate the river east to 
the cave right above the falls. Make your way through the mine, 
collecting treasure as you go. You will eventually reach four doors in
a row, enter the west-most door, the others lead to nothing. West from
there is another trio of doors, again take west-most door. In this room,
you'll meet all the men from Salamand. Talk to the Ninja, his name 
is Pavel, he'll help everyone escape from here. You'll soon venture 
into an intersection, east and south lead to dead ends, the north path 
will lead on. In the next room there is a bridge leading west, take 
this path to reach a chest containing the Warp spell, but be ready with 
Ice spells to fight the Spiketoise guarding it. Return to the 
bridge and head north, take the western door to reach the boss.

Sergeant
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use your strongest weapons against the boss. Have Mindu cast 
 Shield and Blink on the party.

Take the Mythril and have Mindu cast Warp to warp out of the mine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Bafsk Cave
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Long Sword, Longbow, Pass.

Return to Altair and talk to Hilda, she'll give you the Dreadnought password 
and send you to Bafsk to investigate the progress of the empire's Dreadnought. 
Before you leave for Bafsk, go to the weapon shop and talk to Tobul. Show 
him the Mythril and he'll use it to weld new equipment. Altair has new 
Mythril armor and weapons. Paloom and Poft have some additional new Mythril 
weapons. Buy new Mythril equipment and then go to Poft, and take the airship 
to Bafsk. Talk to the soldier in the south end of the town. Tell him the 
Dreadnought password to gain entrance to the cave. After a short walk you'll 
meet a Dark Knight. He and his assistant, Borghen, will walk out of the cave, 
follow them to see the Dreadnought fly off, you were only a minute too late 
Walk back into the cave and take the east path. Be sure to get the treasure 
chest containing the Pass, you'll need this item later on. Step on to the 
warp to return to the entrance of Bafsk. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Snow Cavern
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 100 Gil, 150 Gil, Snowcraft, Notus, Battle Axe, Antidote, 
Mythril Mace, Potion ×2, Ice, Mythril Spear, Mythril Shield, Ancient Sword, 
Silver Plate, Goddess's Bell.

Return to Altair with the horrible news of the Dreadnought's departure. On 
your way back to Altair you'll see the horrible effects of the Dreadnought on 
Poft and Paloom. Their populations have greatly decreased and the towns are 
in ruin. In Poft, tell Cid the Airship password to learn the Sunfire 
password. The Sunfire is the only thing that can stop the Dreadnought. In 
Altair, talk to Hilda. Mindu will leave the party to help with the injured 
Altairians. Enter the king's chambers in the east part of the rebel base. 
Tell him the Sunfire password to learn the Goddess's Bell password. This bell 
is the only way into Kas'ion Castle. Return to Salamand and enter the north 
east house. Talk to the man inside, his name is Josef. Tell him the Goddess's 
Bell password and he'll join you. Return to Semmit Falls and inspect the 
north east wall next to the giant blue stone. Get the chest in here, it 
contains the Snowcraft. Exit Semmit Falls and walk to the northern mountain 
range. Enter the snow field and slide eastward on the Snowcraft. Enter the 
cave when you reach it. Head generally south, collecting treasure as you go. 
You will eventually reach a door that leads to a village of Giant Beavers. 
Talk to the beaver standing in the north of the village. Tell him the 
Goddess's Bell password. Gus understands the beavers and will talk to him. He 
learns that there is a secret passage in the village. Walk to the top of the 
east wall to enter the secret passage. Head south and fight the giant turtle.

Adamantoise
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use ice battle items and Ice spells. Cast Shield on the     
 party. Using weapons is futile, the huge shell is extremely defensive.

Walk up to the wall and get the Goddess's Bell. A set of stairs will form. 
Take these stairs and enter the door. This door leads to a shortcut back to 
the entrance. Borghen will be waiting for you at the entrance.

Borghen
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss is rather weak in comparison with other bosses. This 
 battle shouldn't be too tough as long as you keep your HP up. The easiest 
 way to defeat him is by using weapons.

A giant boulder will begin to fall down the stairs at the entrance. Josef 
will jump in front of it, sacrificing his life for the party. Exit the cave 
and return to Altair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Kas'ion Castle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 300 Gil, Cure, Mythril Axe, Mythril Sword, Gold Shield, Eye Drops, 
Werebane, Mallet, Antidote, Golden Mail, Egil's Torch, Sunfire.

In Altair, talk to Hilda, she'll grieve Josef's death. She'll then explain 
that Gordon went to Kas'ion by himself in search of the Sunfire. You must 
now travel to Kas'ion Castle and help Gordon in his search. Go to Poft and 
take the airship to Kas'ion. Use the Goddess's Bell on the door at the 
entrance to enter the castle. Shortly up the path you'll meet Gordon. He'll 
join you on your way through the castle. As you can see from Gordon's stats, 
he's really weak; you might want to do some leveling up before venturing 
through the rest of the castle. Make your way through the linear castle, 
checking each door and corner for treasure. On the fourth floor you'll fight 
a boss.

Shrieker
 WEAKNESS: Magic
 STRATEGY: Use high level magic spells to defeat it. Otherwise, if your 
 weapon skill is high enough, attack it physically. Watch out for its strong 
 magic attacks.

Get the Egil's Torch. Return to the entrance of the castle and use the Egil's 
Torch on the flame. This will collect Sunfire for you. On the world map, 
head directly south of the castle to the bare patch in the forest to enter 
the Chocobo Forest. Talk to the Chocobo, and you'll automatically exit the 
forest where the Chocobo will be waiting for you. Hop on and head south 
through the huge desert and stop at the gigantic ship just south of the huge 
desert.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Dreadnought
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 400 Gil, Crescent, Shade Bow, Thief's Gloves, Potion ×2, 
Main Gauche, Trident, Ice Shield, Titan's Helm.

Give the soldier at the entrance the Pass that you got in Bafsk Sewers. 
Don't talk to any of the soldiers on the ship unless you have very high 
attack power as they will attack you if you talk to them. To get the 
treasure on the 2nd floor walk through the wall directly west of it. From 
the entrance, head east first and find Cid and Hilda in a cell. Talk to Cid 
and he'll lead Hilda to safety. Return to the first room and head south this 
time. On your way to the engine room you'll find yourself in a maze of 
guards. Don't talk to them and try to find spaces where there are none. 
When you finally reach the engine room, throw the Sunfire into the glowing 
green reactor. Cid will save you just as the Dreadnought blows to 
smithereens. He'll then fly you safely back to Altair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Deist Cavern
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 30 Gil, Gold Hairpin, Cottage, Phoenix Down, Stun, Stop, Curse, 
Unicorn Horn, Eye Drops, Gold Needle, Antidote, Sage's Wisdom ×2, Cross, 
Saint's Spirit ×2, Mallet, Wing Blade, Mythril Helm, Mage's Staff, Pendant, 
Mythril Shield, Acid Bottle, Potion, Knight's Armor, Flame Bow, 
Mythril Mail, Mythril Gloves, Mythril Mirror, Dragon Egg.

Enter the King's chambers and talk to him. He instructs Gordon to rule along 
side Hilda on the throne, and he tells Mindu to seek out the forbidden magic, 
Ultima. Finally, he suggests that Firion and his party travel to Deist and 
seek the aid of the Dragoons. He will then die. Talk to Gordon in the 
throne room to learn the Dragoon password, tell him this password to 
learn the Wind Drake password. From Altair go to Paloom. Talk to the woman 
standing in the entrance, she's a pirate named Leila. She'll offer you a 
ride to Deist in her ship. Exit the town and walk to the ship, it's parked 
just east of Paloom. She'll stop the ship in the middle of the ocean and send 
her crew after you. They are extremely weak, so eliminate them quickly. 
Firion decides to forgive Leila and lets her join the party. You now have 
control of her ship for the rest of the game. Now would be a good time to do 
some leveling up, since Leila will need it for the upcoming dungeon. Sail 
south through the horizontal peninsula and then south east to reach the 
island of Deist. Your ship can port anywhere, so port along the middle of the 
southern edge of the island. Enter the castle in the center of the island. 
Talk to the boy at the entrance, and he will run off, talk to him again and 
he'll run off again. After a short walk you'll see the boy next to his 
mother, talk to her and then enter the room right next to her. You'll meet 
the Wind Drake in this room, he is very weak and on the verge of death. After 
this, explore the entire castle for treasure, there are no enemies so don't 
worry about fighting. Exit the castle and walk north to the cave. This cave 
is full of fierce monsters, so it is essential to have high weapon levels.
The Hill Gigases and Revenants are especially dangerous. First, go to the 
east room and get the shining object, this is the Pendant. Return to Deist 
Castle and tell the dying Wind Drake the Wind Drake password to receive the 
Dragon Egg. Return to Deist Cavern. The south west path leads to 
several treasure chests. The south east path leads to the boss. The south 
east path is very long and maze like, watch out for faulty bridges. 
Eventually you'll reach four doors in a row, take the second to the east 
door. This door leads the boss.

Chimera
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: You'll have to fight several of these in this fight. Block out 
 the effectiveness of their Flame attack by using Shell. Attack them 
 physically. Take advantage of the many status increment items you found 
 throughout the cave.

When the Chimeras are defeated, place the Dragon Egg in the green pool.
Exit the cave and return to Altair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Coliseum
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Antidote, Elixir, Ether, Cottage.

Go to the Rebel Base and enter the room south of the late King's chambers.
Hilda will be waiting, the rest of the party will leave, leaving Firion 
alone with her. She'll tempt him, and as he gets closer she'll transform 
into a Lamia Queen! The rest of the party will then return and will help 
fight her.

Lamia Queen
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Be ready with a Unicorn Horn or a high level Basuna spell to help 
 guard against her sleep and charm spells. Just attack her physically with 
 your highest level equipment.

After the fight you'll learn that Paramecia still has Hilda imprisoned in 
their Coliseum. Go to your ship and sail to a spot near the middle of the 
huge desert below Kas'ion Castle. Walk into the center of the mountain range 
on the east side of the desert. Enter the building below the huge castle in 
the mountains. Be prepared for an immediate boss fight. Walk north toward the 
Emperor's throne and you'll be trapped in the middle of the Coliseum with a 
deadly beast.

Behemoth
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This fight isn't too challenging, although the Behemoth can hit 
 pretty hard. Just attack it with you strongest weapons.

After the fight you'll be thrown into a jail cell. Walk up to the gate and 
you'll see Pavel come to the rescue. Make your way through the short dungeon,
and be sure to check each door, some of them have treasure in them. In the
jail cell area, approach the third to the west cell to rescue the real Hilda. 
Gordon will then leave the party and lead Hilda to safety. Exit to the south 
and return to Altair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Fynn Castle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 1000 Gil ×2, 2000 Gil, Aura, Potion, Doom, Break, Toad, 
Titan's Gloves, Werebane.

When you enter Altair, you'll see that everyone has abandoned the Rebel Base 
and is preparing to retake Fynn. The guard at the entrance. He tells you that 
they are at an encampment south of Fynn. Go north to the encampment below the 
crescent lake south of Fynn. Talk to Hilda and Gordon, and they'll ask you to 
invade Fynn Castle and defeat the Empire's general. Walk north and enter 
Fynn Castle. Head north through the entrance to meet Leila, and she'll join 
you. From here, head directly north, don't bother getting treasure chests 
yet. Enter the throne room and defeat the man sitting on the throne.

Gottos
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use high level weapons and attack spell. He'll occasionally use 
 magic, so use Shell and have Basuna ready if he inflicts any battle effects 
 on the party.

As soon as he is defeated the castle will return to normal. Gordon and Hilda 
will reclaim the thrown and no random battles will occur around the castle. 
Talk to Gordon to learn the Mysidia password, repeat it to him to learn the 
Ultima Scroll password. Tell Hilda the Ultima Scroll password to learn the 
Mask password. Finally, repeat the Mask password to Hilda to learn the 
Ekmet Teloez password. You will then learn that your next quest is to travel 
to the ancient town of Mysidia and to learn more about obtaining Ultima, the 
ultimate magic spell, and how the White and Black Masks play a role in 
obtaining it. You'll also learn that the White Mask is hidden somewhere in 
Fynn Castle's basement. Before leaving the castle, be sure to completely 
explore the castle for treasure. Be intuitive of the many hidden walls 
throughout the castle and watch out for chests containing monsters. Fynn 
town's shops have been re-opened now that the empire was driven out. Go 
shopping for goods at the many stores and buy all new equipment and spells 
for the party in preparation for the next quest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Fynn Basement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Gold Shield, Golden Mail, Gold Plate, Eye Drops, Shirt, Knife, 
Potion ×3, Maiden's Kiss, Flame Shield, Silk Web, Flame Mail, Blood Sword, 
Backstabber, Orichaldagger, White Mask.

Talk to the very top of the east wall in the throne room in Fynn Castle. Tell 
it the Ekmet Teloez password to reveal a path through the wall. Head down 
the castle stairs and stop right before entering the basement. Walk through 
the east wall and then west through the south wall to find hidden treasure. 
Return to the entrance of the basement and continue forward. On the 1st 
floor of the basement the battles will be against almost entirely undead 
monsters, including the hard-hitting Revenants. However, on the other 4 
floors the enemies are generally easy and shouldn't pose too much threat. 
After a long, confusing walk through the basement, you'll finally reach the 
5th floor where there will be a line of 6 doors, take the 5th to the west 
door, the others lead to nothing. In the next room there is a chest 
containing the White Mask and north of that is a warp that brings you back to 
the entrance of the castle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Tropical Island
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: 1000 Gil, Eye Drops, Hi-Potion ×2, Silk Web, Ether, Poison ×2, 
Blind ×2, Slumber Stalk, Silk Web, Garlic, Sleep, Phoenix Down, 
Slumber Stalk ×2, Gaia Drum, Thanatos, Black Mask.

Gordon and Hilda mentioned the ancient town of Mysidia earlier, it's now time 
to go there. To get there, either walk south along the strip of land west of 
Altair, or sail your ship into the into the bay south of Altair. The town is 
settled outside of the west side of a circular mountain range. This town is 
full of ancient wisdom, both in architecture and inhabitants. There are tons 
of new weapons and armor, plus a gigantic selection of magic. Walk to the 
south end of the town and walk down the stairs on the platform in the middle 
of the water. Walk up to the statue and put the White Mask on it. Return to 
your ship and look at your map, you'll see a small dot on the southern end of 
the world, this is your destination. Enter the cave and be ready to tackle a 
long, maze-like dungeon. Eventually you'll reach an area with two paths, take 
the north path to discover a hidden village of strange men wearing black 
masks. The masked man dressed in red on the east side of the village will 
sell you miscellaneous items. Here is a listing of what he sells:
Demon Axe - 10000
Demon Spear - 10000
Ruby Plate - 800
Gaia Drum - 8000
Exit the village and return to the main path. On the 5th floor, enter the 
room located in the middle and fight the boss.

Gigan Rhino
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Occasionally this enemy will inflict a critical hit on a party 
 member, just be ready with curative items and spells. Attack the enemy with 
 your strongest weapons and spells.

Open the chest to get the Black Mask, then walk north and step on the warp to 
return to the entrance. Head back to Mysidia.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Mysidian Cave
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Gold Hairpin, Ninja Suit, Power Staff, Flame Lance, Ogrekiller, 
Ice Bow, Potion ×5, Mute Bell, Phoenix Down, Gold Needle, Drain ×2, Mini, 
Osmose, Crystal Rod.

In Mysidia, heal and stock up on supplies. Also, do some serious leveling 
up, the next cave is tough, so you need to be as resistant as possible. When 
prepared, enter the circular mountain range from the east and enter the cave
inside. In the south of the first room you'll encounter a doppelgänger that 
looks just like Firion. Put the Black Mask on it to move on. Head generally 
south through the entire cave, checking each and every door for treasure. 
Always keep your HP up and be ready with Esuna spells and Gold Needles just 
in case you're stoned by a Cockatrice. Once you reach the chest containing 
the Crystal Rod, warp out and return to Mysidia.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Leviathan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Headband, Power Sash, Power Armlet, Terra Sword, Diamond Shield.

Restore your health at the inn in Mysidia. Before leaving, buy a Cottage at 
the item shop, if you don't already have one. Return to your ship. In the 
bay south of Altair, sail north into the small circular bay. You'll be 
swallowed up by Leviathan, a huge sea monster. You'll find yourself trapped 
in his belly, surrounded by yellow stomach acid that reduces your HP if you 
walk on it. You'll also find that Leila is no longer with you. Continue 
through the creature's intestines until you come to a small settlement of 
other people that have been swallowed by Leviathan. Talk to the man standing 
in the middle of the settlement, his name is Gareth, he is the husband of 
the woman in Deist Castle and the last surviving Dragoon. He'll join 
you if you show him the Crystal Rod. Continue to the mouth of the creature 
and fight the giant worm guarding your ship.

Barrel Worm
 WEAKNESS: Bolt
 STRATEGY: High level Bolt spells work well on this boss. Attacking it 
 with weapons is also an effective way of defeating this boss. Watch your 
 characters' HP and heal continually.

After the fight you'll regain control over your ship, continue north through 
the circular bay and port at the small island with the huge tower on it. Use 
a cottage to restore your party's health and magic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Mysidian Tower
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Staff ×3, Flame Bow, White Robe, Flame Lance, Flame Shield, 
Flame Sword, Flame Mail, Flame Helm, Ice Shield, Ice Gloves, Ice Mail, 
Ice Brand, Ice Lance, Potion, Spellbinder, Silk Web, Hermes, Unicorn Horn, 
Hourglass, Cross, Black Robe, Ultima.

Enter the huge tower. There are several deadly monsters in this tower, some 
of the most deadly are Imps, they can cast Muddle on you and your character 
could easily kill off your entire party if they have high enough weapon 
skill. This is why it's extremely important to be ready with high level 
Basuna spells or Unicorn Horns. There are also lots of new treasures in this 
tower, so be sure to check out every chest, you won't want to miss some of 
them. In the first room, walk north and find the secret hole in the wall to 
get the chest. After getting the room's treasures, go up the central 
staircase. This leads to the fire section of the tower. The lava will 
reduce your party's HP one per step, but it will also prevent you from 
being attacked. You will eventually come to a room with a wizard guarding 
the staircase, defeat it to move on.

Fire Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use your highest level Ice spells on this boss to quickly 
 defeat it. Also very effective in this battle are Notus battle items. 
 This boss can hit hard, so heal often.

There are two paths in the entrance of the ice section, the one near the 
entrance leads to a single treasure chest, and the other leads to the correct 
path. Watch out for the undead creatures in this section of the tower. You 
will soon meet another Gigas, defeat it to move on.

Ice Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Fire
 STRATEGY: Use Fire spells and Hellfires to beat this boss. Weapons are 
 generally weak against this boss. Also, watch out for it's strong Ice 
 spells, and counter them with Shell spells.

The air section is pretty straightforward, just don't stray too far off the 
main path. You'll come to yet another Gigas soon enough.

Thunder Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Earth
 STRATEGY: If you have one, use an Gaia Drum to help defeat this boss. 
 Otherwise, just use your brute strength to defeat this boss. You might also 
 want to set up a shield of Wall, Blink, Shield, or Shell spells to help 
 protect against this boss.

After defeating this boss you'll come to another maze-like floor. One of the 
doors is the correct door, and the others lead to nothing. On the 9th floor, 
in the north-most area, is a chest guarded by a boss.

White Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This monster has very high defense, it's going to be tough trying 
 to defeat it with just weapons alone, so go ahead and use high level magic 
 as well. Also, casting Shield on the party will help boost your defense 
 against this hard hitter.

On the 10th floor you'll meet Mindu. He'll use the last of his life energy 
to open the door for the party. Yet another sacrifice for the party's sake 
has taken place In the next room, touch all of the blue orbs and then 
touch the yellow orb in the middle. You finally have Ultima, the most 
powerful spell in the game! Finally, step on the warp to return to the 
entrance of the tower.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Cyclone
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Ninja Suit, Ruby Plate, Thief's Gloves, Gold Plate, Elixir, 
Gold Hairpin, Silver Plate, Blood Sword, Wind Drake, Ripper, Venom Axe, 
Diamond Gloves, Diamond Helm, Defender, Diamond Mail, Zephyr's Flute.

On your way back to Fynn you'll notice that Altair, Gatrea, Paloom, and Poft 
are all destroyed and can't even be entered. You'll find out what happened 
when you reach Fynn. Enter Fynn Castle and go to the throne room. Talk to 
Hilda to learn the Cyclone password. You'll learn that the Empire summoned 
this Cyclone and destroyed and killed many towns and people. Worst of all, 
it's on a straight course for Fynn. Go to the entrance of the castle and 
enter the staircase to the south west. Head north to the room with the giant 
mirror. Hold the Pendant that you got in Deist Cavern up to the mirror to see 
the Wind Drake hatch from its egg. You'll see it fly directly into the castle 
to meet its master, Gareth, the Dragoon. Before entering the Cyclone, 
enter the town of Fynn and go to Pavel's house in the south west corner of 
the town. Talk to Pavel and then check the wall east of the bed to find a 
secret room. There are eight treasure chest ripe for the picking inside. Exit 
Fynn and walk into the Cyclone just north of Fynn, and the Wind Drake will 
fly you into it. On the first floor, take the take the east staircase first, 
it leads to treasure. Return to the entrance and take the west staircase to 
continue forward. On the 6th floor there is a chest guarded by a boss.

Green Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss has some hard hitting spells and attacks. Be sure to 
 cast spells to protect against it. If you have it, it would also be a good 
 idea to use the Haste spell to give your weapons a boost and speed up the 
 battle.

You'll finally face the emperor on the 7th floor. As you approach him, 
you'll have to fight several guards, these battles are generally easy, so 
don't worry. When you reach the emperor you will confront him.

Emperor
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Defeat the Wood Golem and Royal Guards first. Use weapons to 
 finish off the emperor, he is actually very easy to defeat. Although, 
 you should watch out for his offensive spells and heal when necessary.

You'll automatically return to Fynn Castle after the battle. Hilda and 
Gordon will throw a party to celebrate your victory. Unfortunately, the 
party is stopped short with the horrible news that the Dark Knight has 
claimed the Emperor's throne. And, even worse, you find out that this "Dark 
Knight" is actually your long lost brother, Leon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. Paramecia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Diamond Plate, Hourglass, Garlic, Knife, Buckler, Thunder Spear, 
Saint's Spirit, Healing Staff, Mage's Staff, Spellbinder, Slumber Stalk, 
Elixir ×3, Hellfire, Zephyr's Flute, Sunblade.

Talk to Hilda to learn the Paramecia password. Afterward, go to Pavel's 
house. You'll see that Cid is staying with Pavel, talk to him and he'll lay 
down on the bed. There he will die and in so doing, he'll give you his 
airship! The airship is waiting for you in, the now destroyed, Poft. Get 
there by ship and the airship will be parked in the same place it's always 
been, intact and fully functional. You can now explore the world to your 
heart's content. After leveling up, return to the Coliseum and land on the 
Castle just north of it in the mountain range. In the first room, walk north 
and enter the door. The floor will fall out from under you and you'll 
plummet all the way down to the first floor. Take caution as you explore 
this dungeon, there are many fierce monsters. This castle is full of useful 
treasure, so explore it completely. After a long, twisting path through 
the castle, you'll finally meet the Dark Knight himself, or shall we say, 
Leon. After a short talk with him, the Emperor will suddenly revive. 
Gareth will stay and keep him at bay while the rest of the party and 
Leon escape. How many more people must die for the party's sake?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Jade
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Excalibur, Hellfire, Diamond Mace, Hellfire, Notus, Cat Claws, 
Rune Axe, Backstabber, Aegis Shield, Dragon Mail, Holy Lance, Yoichi's Bow, 
Hi-Potion ×2, Protect Ring.

You'll meet back at Fynn Castle, where the party and Hilda will have a brief 
talk, wherein Maria will mention all the people that died at the hand of the 
empire. Leon will repent for his madness in joining the empire and 
shamefully rejoin the party. Be sure to learn the Pandaemonium password from 
Hilda. Your airship is parked safely outside of Fynn. Use it to go to 
Deist Castle. Tell Gareth's wife the Dragoon password to receive the 
Excalibur, the second best weapon in the game. Now is the time to do some 
serious leveling up. I would recommend having at least 7000 HP and 300 MP 
per character, even more would be better. You should spend all your excess 
money on buying Elixirs. When you're ready, fly to the east end of the 
horizontal peninsula south east of Fynn and enter the huge hole by foot. This 
is the first of the last two dungeons in the game, I hope you're prepared. 
It isn't too hard to find your way through this dungeon, just be sure to 
check each door. On the 2nd floor there is a chest guarded by a boss.

Blue Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use your strongest weapons. Use Shield to shield against its 
 attacks. Heal whenever it deals a critical hit.

The waterfall on the third floor will lower your HP with each step. There is 
another chest on the third floor guarded by a boss.

King Behemoth
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss has really strong defense, therefore, you may want to 
 try defeating it with powerful magic more than fighting it physically. This 
 boss is a hard hitter, he could easily kill one of your characters in a 
 single blow, so take necessary precautions in this battle.

Behind the waterfall at the very bottom of the 3rd floor is a shop that sells 
extremely powerful magic. You'll definitely want to look into buying some of 
these spells:
Doom - 10000
Berserk - 10000
Haste - 20000
Flare - 40000
On the fourth floor, there is yet another chest guarded by a boss.

Red Dragon
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use Ice spells and Notus battle items to win this 
 battle. Weapons are almost completely useless in this fight. Unless you 
 have someone using the Excalibur with a level 16 sword skill, try not to 
 rely on weapons.

On the 6th floor you'll find a warp that will transport you to the final 
dungeon. You can cast Warp now if you don't think you're ready, otherwise, 
just continue to the warp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Pandaemonium
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURE: Ether, Eye Drops, Genji Gloves, Masamune, Genji Helm, Genji Armor, 
Ribbon, Sage's Wisdom, Hellfire, Acid Bottle.

This is it! You've finally reached the final dungeon, the residing place of 
the Emperor, Pandaemonium. There are several precautions to take. First, 
beware the monsters in this dungeon, some of them hit extremely hard, some 
confuse your party, and others can kill a party member in a single hit. To 
counter such hardships you should always keep your MP high enough to be able 
to use your Cure spells. You should also bring along as many Unicorn Horns 
and high level Basuna spells as possible. You should wear armor that 
protects your status, such as Ribbons and Protect Rings. Finally, use 
Elixirs whenever needed. The first, second and third floors are pretty 
straightforward. On the 4th floor you'll come to a line of four doors. From 
the west, take the 1st door first. Go to the east section of this room and 
walk through the bottom of the wall east of the huge pillar to find a hidden 
room. You'll find a chest containing the Masamune, the best weapon in the 
game. Exit the hidden room and walk to the chest, it's guarded by a boss.

Zombie Borghen
 WEAKNESS: Holy, Fire, Cure
 STRATEGY: Since this boss is undead, you can use Cure spells to help 
 defeat it. Also effective are Fire and Holy spells. Overall, this is a 
 pretty easy battle.

Exit this room and enter the 2nd from the west door. Follow the path to the 
chest, it's also guarded by a boss.

Tiamat
 WEAKNESS: Flare
 STRATEGY: If you took the time to level up your best spells before entering 
 Pandaemonium, now would be a good time to use them. You can also use 
 weapons, now that you have the Masamune. Watch out for this bosses 
 attacks, they hurt.

Exit this room and this time enter the 4th from the west room. The chest in 
here is also guarded by a boss.

Beelzebub
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: The best method of defeating this enemy is just attacking it 
 physically. This boss has a lot of HP so keep attacking it as hard as you 
 can. You should also be ready to cure status ailments, should this boss use 
 them against you.

Exit this room and enter the 3rd to the west room. This is the last chest 
guarded by a boss, and it's the hardest of the four, so heal up before 
opening the chest.

Astaroth
 WEAKNESS: Ultima, Flare, Holy
 STRATEGY: This boss hits extremely hard, not only that, it can also kill 
 your entire party in one hit with its death spell. Always keep your HP to 
 the max and revive dead characters immediately. Only attack physically with 
 the Masamune and have everyone else use your best spells, such as Ultima, 
 Flare, and Holy.

After this fight, continue following the path in this room to the warp. From 
here, the path is very linear, just follow it normally and eventually you'll 
come to a room full of glowing pillars. Got to the south west corner of this 
room to reach the warp. Walk north and stop before engaging the final boss. 
Make sure everyone is fully healed in both HP and MP and equip each member 
with two Elixirs. Engage the Emperor for the final battle!

Emperor
 WEAKNESS: Ultima, Flare, Holy
 STRATEGY: Attack the Emperor physically with the Masamune and the Excalibur, 
 whoever attacks physically should have Haste cast on them. Use Ultima, 
 Flare, and Holy spells. Heal with Cure for HP, Esuna for status ailments, 
 and Basuna for battle effects. Create a defensive shield by using Wall, 
 Blink, Shield, Shell, and Barrier spells. 
 [Secret]: If you saved your Blood Swords, equip someone with both, or divide 
 them between two characters (or one, if you only have one of the swords). 
 The battle will probably be over within one or two rounds, depending on your 
 characters' sword skill levels.

After the battle, it's over, you've completed the game!

XXI. BOSS STRATEGIES
=============================================================================

Adamantoise
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use ice battle items and Ice spells. Cast Shield on the     
 party. Using weapons is futile, the huge shell is extremely defensive.

Astaroth
 WEAKNESS: Ultima, Flare, Holy
 STRATEGY: This boss hits extremely hard, not only that, it can also kill 
 your entire party in one hit with its death spell. Always keep your HP to 
 the max and revive dead characters immediately. Only attack physically with 
 the Masamune and have everyone else use your best spells, such as Ultima, 
 Flare, and Holy.

Barrel Worm
 WEAKNESS: Bolt
 STRATEGY: High level Bolt spells work well on this boss. Attacking it 
 with weapons is also an effective way of defeating this boss. Watch your 
 characters' HP and heal continually.

Beelzebub
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: The best method of defeating this enemy is just attacking it 
 physically. This boss has a lot of HP so keep attacking it as hard as you 
 can. You should also be ready to cure status ailments, should this boss use 
 them against you.

Behemoth
 LOCATION: Coliseum
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This fight isn't too challenging, although the Behemoth can hit 
 pretty hard. Just attack it with you strongest weapons.

Blue Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use your strongest weapons. Use Shield to shield against its 
 attacks. Heal whenever it deals a critical hit.

Borghen
 LOCATION: Snow Cavern
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss is rather weak in comparison with other bosses. This 
 battle shouldn't be too tough as long as you keep your HP up. The easiest 
 way to defeat him is by using weapons.

Chimera
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: You'll have to fight several of these in this fight. Block out 
 the effectiveness of their Flame attack by using Shell. Attack them 
 physically. Take advantage of the many status increment items you found 
 throughout the cave.

Emperor
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Defeat the Wood Golem and Royal Guards first. Use weapons to 
 finish off the emperor, he is actually very easy to defeat. Although, 
 you should watch out for his offensive spells and heal when necessary.

Emperor (Final)
 WEAKNESS: Ultima, Flare, Holy
 STRATEGY: Attack the Emperor physically with the Masamune and the Excalibur, 
 whoever attacks physically should have Haste cast on them. Use Ultima, 
 Flare, and Holy spells. Heal with Cure for HP, Esuna for status ailments, 
 and Basuna for battle effects. Create a defensive shield by using Wall, 
 Blink, Shield, Shell, and Barrier spells. 
 [Secret]: If you saved your Blood Swords, equip someone with both, or divide 
 them between two characters (or one, if you only have one of the swords). 
 The battle will probably be over within one or two rounds, depending on your 
 characters' sword skill levels.

Fire Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use your highest level Ice spells on this boss to quickly 
 defeat it. Also very effective in this battle are Notus battle items. 
 This boss can hit hard, so heal often.

Gottos
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use high level weapons and attack spell. He'll occasionally use 
 magic, so use Shell and have Basuna ready if he inflicts any battle effects 
 on the party.

Gigan Rhino
 LOCATION: Tropical Island
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Occasionally this enemy will inflict a critical hit on a party 
 member, just be ready with curative items and spells. Attack the enemy with 
 your strongest weapons and spells.

Green Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss has some hard hitting spells and attacks. Be sure to 
 cast spells to protect against it. If you have it, it would also be a good 
 idea to use the Haste spell to give your weapons a boost and speed up the 
 battle.

Ice Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Fire
 STRATEGY: Use Fire spells and Hellfires to beat this boss. Weapons are 
 generally weak against this boss. Also, watch out for it's strong Ice 
 spells, and counter them with Shell spells.

King Behemoth
 LOCATION: Jade
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This boss has really strong defense, therefore, you may want to 
 try defeating it with powerful magic more than fighting it physically. This 
 boss is a hard hitter, he could easily kill one of your characters in a 
 single blow, so take necessary precautions in this battle.

Lamia Queen
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Be ready with a Unicorn Horn or a high level Basuna spell to help 
 guard against her sleep and charm spells. Just attack her physically with 
 your highest level equipment.

Red Dragon
 WEAKNESS: Ice
 STRATEGY: Use Ice spells and Notus battle items to win this 
 battle. Weapons are almost completely useless in this fight. Unless you 
 have someone using the Excalibur with a level 16 sword skill, try not to 
 rely on weapons.

Sergeant
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: Use your strongest weapons against the boss. Have Mindu cast 
 Shield and Blink on the party.

Shrieker
 LOCATION: Kas'ion Castle
 WEAKNESS: Magic
 STRATEGY: Use high level magic spells to defeat it. Otherwise, if your 
 weapon skill is high enough, attack it physically. Watch out for its strong 
 magic attacks.

Thunder Gigas
 WEAKNESS: Earth
 STRATEGY: If you have one, use an Gaia Drum to help defeat this boss. 
 Otherwise, just use your brute strength to defeat this boss. You might also 
 want to set up a shield of Wall, Blink, Shield, or Shell spells to help 
 protect against this boss.

Tiamat
 WEAKNESS: Flare
 STRATEGY: If you took the time to level up your best spells before entering 
 Pandaemonium, now would be a good time to use them. You can also use 
 weapons, now that you have the Masamune. Watch out for this bosses 
 attacks, they hurt.

White Dragon
 WEAKNESS: None
 STRATEGY: This monster has very high defense, it's going to be tough trying 
 to defeat it with just weapons alone, so go ahead and use high level magic 
 as well. Also, casting Shield on the party will help boost your defense 
 against this hard hitter.

Zombie Borghen
 WEAKNESS: Holy, Fire, Cure
 STRATEGY: Since this boss is undead, you can use Cure spells to help 
 defeat it. Also effective are Fire and Holy spells. Overall, this is a 
 pretty easy battle.

=============================================================================
XXII. SECRETS
=============================================================================

Blood Swords deal huge amounts of damage when used against monsters or bosses 
with large amounts of HP. Use this to your advantage when fighting bosses to 
significantly shorten battles.

While using your Airship, press the action button to greatly increase the 
ship's speed. Press it again to cancel this effect.

If monsters aren't hitting you hard enough to raise your HP, attack your own 
characters to help gain HP faster.

To level up your weapons and spells extremely fast, attack a target, or use a 
spell, and then cancel it before actually starting the turn. Continue this 
process 100 times to gain a level.

An Omake Mode is unlocked when you beat the game that allows you to view 
monster stats and game-related media.

To catch a Chocobo, head to the bare patch in the forest directly south of 
Kas'ion castle. Talk to the Chocobo and you'll automatically appear outside 
where the Chocobo will be waiting for you.

When the Cyclone appears, speak with Gordon and Hilda in Fynn Castle to 
learn new passwords. Then, go to Pavel's house in the town of Fynn and talk 
to him. Check the wall east of the bed in his house to find a hidded room 
full of treasure.
