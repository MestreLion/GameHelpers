## 12.1

**Q:** *How do I get a Mr. Handy?*

**A:** Like with lunchboxes, pets, and Quantums, you can get them free from objectives and quests or by buying them from the in-game store. They can also be found as the rare card of lunchboxes, though the chance is low.

## 12.2

**Q:** *What is Mr. Handy even good for?*

**A:** There's a limit of one Mr. Handy per floor. You put one on a floor, and they'll automatically hover over and collect from any resource room when it's ready. It's not immediate, but if you have a good amount of excess resource production and storage plus a Mr. Handy on all of your resource floors, then you don't have to worry about manually collecting at all. One by himself is not that useful. Beyond resource collection Mr. Handy also rushes to help with any incident that breaks out on his floor, though his damage is awful. You can send him exploring (see **[12.3](#123)**), he can help quite a bit with "without a weapon" objectives (see **[11.4](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-11:-Objectives#114)**), and he can help with resource collection objectives (bullet 8 in **[11.2](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-11:-Objectives#112)**).

## 12.3

**Q:** *Mr. Handy can be sent into the wasteland to explore?*

**A:** He can. You can send at most five in addition to your 25 explorers. Mr. Handy takes no damage while exploring, but he only finds caps and will auto-return once he hits 5000. It takes somewhere in the range of 2.5 to 5 days for him to hit 5000 (it varies a lot), plus there's half whatever it takes in return time as well. For an early game vault 5000 caps every 4 to 7 days is pretty good, so I'd recommend sending any Mr. Handy out early game unless you need his help with incidents or resources.

## 12.4

**Q:** *Can I repair Mr. Handy?*

**A:** No, nor does he regain health over time. If he eventually dies he can be repaired to full health for 2000 caps though, in both normal and survival vaults. His destruction and repair do not count towards the deaths and revivals stats of your vault, nor does his destruction count as a casualty in completing any "do X without casualties" objectives.

## 12.5

**Q:** *What can Mr. Handy not do?*

**A:** He can't auto-tap any icons over dwellers (level up, stat up, giving birth). He also can't collect from a finished crafting room, and he won't do anything to a generated signal from a radio room.
