**A:** Here's a table, links provided within are for further reading:

## 2.2

**Q:** *What SPECIALs should I train to max?*

**A:** Check **[2.1](#21)** to see what affects what to determine what you want to do. If you're looking for the bare minimum for the best possible dwellers, then all dwellers should be trained to max endurance while at level 1 and leveled to 50 with preferably some good endurance gear. Explorers generally work well with max SPECIAL, while people in the vault only need endurance for health, plus luck and whatever stat is needed for the room they'll be in. Any designated crafting dwellers work best with max SPECIAL, as there are items requiring each SPECIAL you can craft. Questing only directly uses PAL (while E for health is also very important), so for questers you can max PEAL and ignore SCI.
## 2.3

**Q:** *Do outfits increase SPECIAL above 10?*

**A:** Yes. The maximum possible you can have in one attribute is 17 (10 with a +7 legendary outfit).

## 2.4

**Q:** *If I move a dweller out of a training room, will they lose the progress they have made?*

**A:** No. SPECIAL levels work just like regular experience levels, in that dwellers gain experience points toward that stat. When you move them back into the training room they will continue exactly where they left off.

## 2.5

**Q:** *I've read that intelligence will increase how much experience dwellers get and will reduce training time, is this true?*

**A:** It's not, no SPECIAL increases how much experience a dweller earns, either towards levels or SPECIAL. The only way to make dwellers level up faster is with an Experience pet, while the only way to reduce training time is with a Training Time pet, to have more dwellers in the training room, or to have a more upgraded training room.

While it's an understandable theory given intelligence increases experience earned in Fallout 4, which shares a lot with Fallout Shelter, you can test for yourself with low and high intelligence dwellers. They'll earn the same experience from all sources in the game both for leveling up and training.

## 2.6

**Q:** *I've heard that strength increases damage, is this true?*

**A:** I've yet to see any evidence it's true. I've got a **[post here](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/8lyinz/testing_for_strength_and_damage/)** that covers combat in the vault, quests, and exploration, with testing and links to sources. There's summaries in the post, but for an extra short summary it's nothing for the vault (no SPECIAL contributes to combat, just endurance for health), nothing for quests, and a minor role in exploration next to PECI (with AL being by far the most important).
