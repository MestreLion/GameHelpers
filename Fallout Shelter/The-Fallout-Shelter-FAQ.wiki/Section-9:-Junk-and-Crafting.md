**Q:** *How do SPECIALs affect crafting?*

**A:** In the crafting GUI where you can select a recipe to craft, in each item's slot you'll see a stat. If you tell the room to craft that item, that is the stat you then want in the room. When crafting something, the room displays the item's stat like other rooms display their stat. The crafting time you see in the slot is how long it would take with the current total relevant SPECIAL in the room plus any crafting pet. Especially for legendary items you can make huge improvements to crafting time by having six 10 stat dwellers in the room each with a +5 or +7 outfit, plus a crafting time pet (from weeks to hours). Basically pile as much relevant SPECIAL into the crafting room as you can, through dwellers and outfits, and definitely throw a crafting time pet in if you have one. This **[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4ako4t/weapon_and_outfit_workshops_how_they_work_and_how/)** plus some of the comments (hivemind_disruptor, limeybastard) include some in-depth analysis of how crafting time is determined, and the wiki has a bunch of exact times for **[weapons](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_workshop)** and **[outfits](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Outfit_workshop#Production_time)**.

With outfits the SPECIAL requirement is usually the highest stat an outfit offers, but for outfits with no clear highest stat it is fairly random. Weapons are a lot more consistent with SPECIAL requirements, so here's a summary for them (*italicized* are single weapons):

- *S:* Junk Jets, Flamers, Miniguns, Missile Launchers, Gatling Lasers, Fat Men, Plasma Throwers, *Baseball Bat*, *Relentless Raider Sword*

- *P:* BB Guns, Lever-Action Rifles, Hunting Rifles, Pipe Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Laser Rifles, Railway Rifles, Gauss Rifles, Plasma Rifles, *Laser Musket*, *Kitchen Knife*

- *E:* Sawed-Off Shotguns, Shotguns, Combat Shotguns, *Pickaxe*

- *C:*

- *I:* Institute Pistols, Institute Rifles, *Fire Hydrant Bat*

- *A:* .32 Pistols, 10mm Pistols, Scoped .44s, Pipe Pistols, Laser Pistols, Assault Rifles, Plasma Pistols, Alien Blasters, *Pool Cue*

- *L:* *Butcher Knife*

Henrietta is currently the only non-craftable weapon, and is only obtainable by getting Old Longfellow in lunchboxes. As you can see a lot of the best weapons are crafted with strength, while most everything else is perception and agility (with a touch of endurance and intelligence).

## 9.2

**Q:** *How do I get junk?*

**A:** Junk can be found in the wasteland (see **[9.6](#96)**) and can be recovered from weapons and outfits by scrapping them (see **[9.7](#97)**). You also get a guaranteed random piece of junk from every lunchbox, and can get junk as loot from quests.

## 9.3

**Q:** *How do I get recipes?*

**A:** They can occasionally be dropped by raiders as the loot drop instead of a weapon or outfit, and they can occasionally be found as loot during quests, but you'll find most of your recipes in the wasteland. Note that recipes do not count towards the 100 item explorer carry limit (see **[10.8](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-10:-The-Wasteland#108)**).

## 9.4

**Q:** *Why can't I build a weapon/outfit/theme workshop?*

**A:** All of them can only be triple size. Make sure you have space.

## 9.5

**Q:** *I have the recipe, required junk, and required caps, so why can't I see the option to craft it?*

**A:** You also need to upgrade your crafting rooms to be able to craft rare (level 2) and legendary (level 3) items. Upgrading the crafting rooms requires you to have a certain population when you do the upgrade, unlike unlocking rooms which are unlocked permanently once you reach the population. Once you have upgraded the room to the appropriate level, don't forget you need the recipe, junk, and caps to craft something. For the theme workshop you can always craft any of the themes, all upgrading does is hugely reduce crafting times. Here's the population requirements for upgrading the workshops:

Room|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3
:---|:---|:---|:---
Weapon Workshop|22 to unlock|45 to upgrade|75 to upgrade
Outfit Workshop|32 to unlock|55 to upgrade|90 to upgrade
Theme Workshop|42 to unlock|65 to upgrade|105 to upgrade

## 9.6

**Q:** *How does finding junk in the wasteland work? Are +X% wasteland junk pets worth it?*

**A:** Short version, Wasteland Junk pets are amazing in survival but only average in normal.

Basically there are two kinds of junk events, fixed and repeatable. Repeatable occur roughly every 160 minutes, while fixed occur at fixed times of course. Both events have a specific SPECIAL stat associated with them, and the higher that explorer's stat the better the chance of getting a piece of junk. What SPECIAL matters is actually different depending on a **[normal](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/5r6tsw/legendary_junk_finding_in_normal_mode_special/)** or **[survival](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/5qrevx/legendary_junk_finding_in_survival_mode/)** vault (etherealshatter). In survival explorers find way more legendary junk and constantly do it so long as they can survive the trip, so as long as they survive what SPECIAL they have doesn't really matter. In normal though endurance, charisma, and luck (ECL) are the biggest SPECIAL determinants in finding legendary junk. Because of the lower drop rates, you will actually maximize the amount of legendary junk you get by leaving SPIA low and maxing ECL (while focusing on EL with outfits).

Wasteland Junk pets add their percent chance of getting a second piece of junk if an explorer succeeds at a junk event. Since explorers find a tonne of legendary junk in survival this pet greatly increases how much is found. In normal though because much less legendary junk is found, this pet can sometimes cause an explorer to find more regular junk and return sooner before they get more legendary junk than they would've without the pet. If one focuses on early legendary junk though (which is mostly endurance determined), say by equipping Heavy Wasteland Gear on a max SPECIAL explorer, then this pet can still shine (though Wasteland Return Speed is better).

## 9.7

**Q:** *How does scrapping weapons and outfits for junk work?*

**A:** In your vault storage, when you select a weapon or outfit, next to the sell button will be a scrap button. Hitting that then brings up a scrap one or scrap all button. When you scrap an item, you only get junk that would've been used to craft the item (see **[9.8](#98)** for a list of recipes and junk requirements). You can get anywhere from no junk to all of the junk that would've been used to craft it. There's a certain chance for different amounts of junk it could give you, so for rare and legendary items which take a lot of junk, you'll probably get at least something out of scrapping them. For common items on the other hand, because they don't take much junk, you're much more likely to get nothing out of scrapping them. Note that collecting junk from scrapping something counts towards collect junk objectives, even if from an item you just crafted.

## 9.8

**Q:** *Is there a list of all the recipes and what junk they require?*

**A:** Check the Fallout wiki for **[weapons](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_workshop)** and **[outfits](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Outfit_workshop)**.

## 9.9

**Q:** *Should I craft early on? What junk should I keep?*

**A:** Crafting is not worth it immediately. You'll probably find all the common weapons and outfits you need early on from exploring, so you're probably better off saving to craft rare. However, you need 45 dwellers to craft rare weapons and 55 dwellers to craft rare outfits (see **[9.5](#95)**), plus you need to find the recipes from exploring. Since crafting rooms have to be triple size, you will also need to train dwellers up a bit and probably have multiple in the room to not have ridiculous crafting times (see **[9.1](#91)**). You could also strategically use Quantums to help get the first few +5 outfits quicker to help with crafting (see the third bullet point in **[19.3](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-19:-Nuka-Cola-Quantum#193)**). Early on dwellers can be swapped out depending on what the room is crafting. Once you can start crafting good rares though then it really is worth it. Good rares are any of the +5 outfits, plus the highest tier rare weapons like plasma rifles and flamers. As for what junk to keep, always keep your legendary junk, unless you 100% know you won't need it for anything now or in the future. When it comes to rare and common, there are a couple strategies:

- Definitely check **[9.8](#98)** out to see what junk is required for what, so you can determine what you want to keep.

- Set a limit on how much you want to carry. This is better later in the game where storage isn't as much of an issue and you can afford to keep lots of stuff.

- By the time you get to the point where you're crafting legendaries, your only bottleneck will probably be legendary junk. You could sell all common and rare junk then except what's needed for rare stuff you want to craft. **[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4eyqb2/what_junk_to_keep/d24jm3g)** (ShardisWolfe) and **[this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4eyqb2/what_junk_to_keep/d24seo5)** (metallicrooster) both list key junk to keep for those good rares.

- Keep your junk stored in weapons and outfits. With common weapons and outfits it may not be worth it (as there's a high chance to get no junk), but with rare weapons and outfits they almost always give more than one junk, meaning the item will take up less storage space than the junk. A good alternative if you're tight on storage space. See **[9.7](#97)** for full detail on scrapping.

## 9.10

**Q:** *I want to fill out the weapons and outfits tabs in the VDSG, what can't I craft?*

**A:** First, if you don't know what you're missing, check out **[7.1](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-7:-Weapons-and-Outfits#71)** for a list of weapons and outfits. There are currently 183 weapons in the game, only one of which isn't craftable. That weapon is Henrietta, and comes with Old Longfellow in lunchboxes. There are currently 138 outfits in the game, 119 of which can be crafted. Of the missing 19:

- 6 are lunchbox only commons with 4 SPECIAL each.

    - Accountant Outfit (+4P)

    - Agent Provocateur (+4I)

    - Bespoke Attire (+4E)

    - Business Suit (+4C)

    - Country Girl (+4S)

    - Waitress Uniform (+4A)

- 3 are lunchbox only rares with 6 SPECIAL each.

    - Bowling Shirt (+6P)

    - Motorcycle Jacket (+6S)

    - Swing Dress (+6A)

- 5 are rare holiday outfits (2 Halloween, 1 Thanksgiving, 2 Christmas) which could be found like any other outfit, but only during their respective holidays. If you're missing any all you can do is hope they drop next holiday. Check out **[20.23](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests#2023)** for a list of all the holiday quests.

    - Ghost Costume (+2E, +3A), (Halloween)

    - Skeleton Costume (+2S, +3L), (Halloween)

    - Pilgrim Outfit (+3C, +2I), (Thanksgiving)

    - Elf Outfit (+3I, +2L), (Christmas)

    - Santa Outfit (+3P, +2C), (Christmas)

- 4 are legendary high total SPECIAL outfits that can only be gotten once each as rewards from specific quests. 1 is a holiday outfit from one of the Christmas quests.

    - Jobinson's Jersey (+4S, +4P, +4C, +4A)

    - Detective Outfit (+4P, +4E, +4I, +4L)

    - Original Santa Suit (+4P, +3E, +4C), (Christmas)

    - Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse Outfit, you get to pick one and only one of the following:

        - Famine's Vestment (+4S, +4E, +4I, +4L)

        - Pestilence's Plating (+4E, +4C, +4I, +4A)

        - War's Armor (+4S, +4P, +4E, +4C)

        - Death's Jacket (+4P, +4E, +4A, +4L)

- 1 comes with Old Longfellow in lunchboxes.

    - Tattered Longcoat (+2S, +2E, +2C, +2L)

Old Longfellow's weapon (Henrietta) and outfit (Tattered Longcoat) are a special case in that they will show up in the VDSG if you got them, but the VDSG will otherwise exclude them in both spaces and totals. If you don't have them the weapons and outfit totals will then be 182 and 137 respectively. When you start a new game the VDSG will list the totals as 182 and 130 respectively, meaning it's excluding 7 more outfits from the total until you get them. I believe those are the 5 rare holiday outfits, the Original Santa Suit, and the Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse Outfit.

## 9.11

**Q:** *Does the stat used in crafting weapons affect their actual use in combat?*

**A:** No, the SPECIAL used in crafting ONLY affects production time.

## 9.12

**Q:** *If I wanted to craft one of everything, how much junk would I need?*

**A:** thetoastmonster made two great posts for exactly this. They are correct as of version 1.13.
