**Q:** *How do I get Bottle and Cappy to visit my vault?*

**A:** There is a limited time quest chain of five quests to find them, and completing the quest chain will cause them to randomly visit your vault every once in a while whenever you're in the game. The quest chain is available even in new vaults, "limited time" refers to it eventually disappearing from your quest log if you leave it a long time. I don't know for certain how long, but have been told it requires a significant amount of waiting.

**Q:** *What do they do when they visit?*

**A:** They wander around in your vault randomly, making stops in rooms. Whenever they stop in a room there's a chance they'll start dancing. If you tap on them while they're dancing you'll get a reward. Cappy dances in almost every room and rewards caps when tapped, while Bottle dances much less frequently but can reward caps or Quantums. After a while, whether you've been tapping them or not, they'll leave.

For the duration of their visit they also provide a temporary +20% happiness boost to everyone in the vault. If a dweller was higher than 80% happiness before the visit (including 100%) they will return to exactly what they were before (unlike the small bonus from radio rooms).

Unfortunately, as they open the vault door when they enter and leave, they are capable of triggering exterior incidents like deathclaws (if you have the population to trigger them of course). You cannot refuse their entry or stop them from coming, once you've done their quests they will forever visit your vault with no way to influence it. Them opening the door probably won't be a problem for you anyway, but just so you're aware.
