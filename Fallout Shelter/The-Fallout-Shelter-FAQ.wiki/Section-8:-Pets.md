## 8.1

**Q:** *Where can I find a list of pets?*

**A:** The **[Fallout wiki](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Shelter_pets)** has a good list of all the breeds and their legendary versions, plus the possible stat variance for each pet.

## 8.2

**Q:** *What's the best pet?*

**A:** Like with outfits, that depends what the dweller is doing. Check **[here](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4byy49/pets_to_keep_and_bestworst/d1dqbrx)** (ShardisWolfe) for a very good breakdown of all the pet effects and what's useful. An important thing to note though is that for Wasteland Junk pets specifically, their usefulness depends on whether you're in normal or survival. They're amazing in survival but only average in normal. See **[9.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-9:-Junk-and-Crafting#96)** for more information on how finding junk works.

## 8.3

**Q:** *How do I get pets?*

**A:** Like with lunchboxes, Mr. Handy, and Quantums, you can get them free from objectives and quests or by buying them from the in-game store. They can also be found as the rare card of lunchboxes, though the chance is low.

## 8.4

**Q:** *Do pet bonuses stack?*

**A:** No. Most pets affect only a single dweller, but several affect multiple. Equipping two pets with the same effect in the same "area of effect" will not stack them, only the highest bonus will be used while any others will be ignored. These are all of the effects that apply to more than one dweller:

- The effects Crafting Cost, Crafting Time, Objective Completion, and Stranger Chance apply to the whole room they're in.

- Wasteland Return Speed applies to all the dwellers in a questing group.

## 8.5

**Q:** *This is a crappy pet, should I sell it?*

**A:** Some pets you will probably never get any use out of because they're just plain bad. I'd personally sell them if you know you won't need them. However, if you're in a survival mode vault, keep all the pets you get. If you equip any pet on an explorer or quester and they die, they're still dead (perma-death can't be avoided in survival), but the pet will bring back *everything* they were carrying, including what they had equipped. Obviously giving them a useful pet would be better, but if you don't have any then give them bad pets so that you at least don't have to worry about someone you sent out with good gear dying and losing it.

## 8.6

**Q:** *Why is the bonus on (insert Legendary pet) worse than a Common pet?*

**A:** There are messed up pet breeds which have no Common or Rare versions, but instead have 3 Legendary versions where 2 of the Legendaries have bonuses consistent with a Common or Rare pet. The affected pet breeds include:

- Bloodhound (dog - Wasteland Junk)

- Pit Bull Terrier (dog - Damage)

- LaPerm (cat - Wasteland Junk)

- Manx (cat - Twins Chance)

There are correctly designed pet breeds as alternatives to most of the above. These include:

- St. Bernard (dog - Wasteland Junk) as alternative to Bloodhound

- Lykoi (cat - Damage) as alternative to Pit Bull Terrier

- Palla's Cat (cat - Wasteland Junk) as alternative to LaPerm

In addition to the above, there are also some breeds with a Rare version but no Common version, and 2 Legendary versions.

## 8.7

**Q:** *Is there a limit to the number of pets I can equip?*

**A:** There a couple depending on what we're talking about:

- Per room you can only have pets equipped to half the room's dweller capacity. A single room can only have one pet, a double two, and a triple three (compared to two, four, and six dwellers respectively). The one and only exception is the vault door, which can have both two dwellers and two pets in it.

- There is a hard pet equip limit of 100. Across all explorers, questers, and dwellers in the vault you are only allowed to have a maximum of 100 equipped. You can have as many as you want in storage as long as you have the storage space, but only 100 equipped. Here's a **[picture](http://i.imgur.com/WucQtNU.png)** (DanEngler) of the notification you get when you reach that limit.

## 8.8

**Q:** *I got an objective completion pet, what do they do?*

**A:** The only current effects are x2 and x3, and they don't stack (see **[8.4](#84)**). When you equip one to a dweller, **any** objective that dweller contributes to will have their contribution multiplied by the pet's modifier. Collect water? Put the pet in a water room to double or triple how much collecting from that room counts. Survive deathclaw attacks without casualties? Have the pet on a dweller in the room where the attack ends. Stop incidents? Have the pet in the same room the incident is stopped in. Craft weapons? Have the pet in the crafting room when you collect the crafted weapon. The possibilities are endless, and this is probably the most useful pet in the game for this reason.
