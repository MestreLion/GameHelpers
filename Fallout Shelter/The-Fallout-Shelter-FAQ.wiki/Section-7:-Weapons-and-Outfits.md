**Q:** *Where can I find a list of weapons/outfits?*

**A:** As mentioned in **[1.3](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-1:-Important-Information#13)**, check the Fallout wiki for **[weapons](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Shelter_weapons)** and **[outfits](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Shelter_outfits)**. If you're looking for a complete picture of the survival guide so you can easily see what weapons and outfits you're missing, give **[this post](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4wjj95/vdsg_weapons_and_outfits/)** of mine a look.

**Q:** *What's the best weapon?*

**A:** Almost always that's whatever is the highest damage. The top three are:

- Dragon's Maw at 22-29 damage (25.5 average). Craftable only.

- Fire Hydrant Bat at 19-31 damage (25 average). Craftable only, except for one that's a reward for the "Duo of Destruction: Glowing Radscorpions" quest.

- MIRV at 22-27 damage (24.5 average). Craftable or obtainable from lunchbox.

The one exception is quests (including random wasteland quests explorers find, but not exploration itself). Quests introduce the extra mechanic of how weapons deal their damage. See **[20.2](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests#202)** for the breakdown of weapons in quests.

## 7.3

**Q:** *What's the best outfit?*

**A:** The answer to that depends on what the dweller is doing, as outfits only provide SPECIAL bonuses:

- In the vault, outfits that provide more in a single SPECIAL are almost always more useful than outfits that provide less spread out over multiple SPECIAL. There's an outfit for each kind of SPECIAL that provides a bonus to just that stat, and each comes in three forms, common (+3), rare (+5), and legendary (+7). You'll likely start trying to get everyone +3 outfits depending on the room they're working in, then +5, and only much later in the game when you're able to craft legendaries with ease will you really work towards those +7 outfits. See **[2.1](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-2:-SPECIAL#21)** for a quick breakdown of SPECIAL.

- For exploration it becomes a much more difficult question, so see **[10.4](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-10:-The-Wasteland#104)** for that.

- Questing isn't nearly as complicated for best SPECIAL compared to exploration, check out **[20.3](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests#203)** for the shorter rundown.

**Q:** *How do weapons and outfits affect wasteland exploration?*

**A:** See **[10.2](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-10:-The-Wasteland#102)**.

## 7.5

**Q:** *Do outfits affect training or combat in the vault? Do they provide armor or damage/radiation resistance?*

**A:** No to all of that. Endurance does affect health, which of course matters for vault combat, but endurance itself doesn't have a direct effect (see **[4.1](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-4:-Dweller-Happiness-and-Health#41)** for health). Endurance is useless on level 50 dwellers in the vault as their max health is set at that point, unless of course they're in a room that needs it like bottlers or a crafting room.

There are only two cases of resistance in the game. One is obvious, Damage Resistance pets, they work anywhere. The other is rad resistance in exploration only (not vault or quests). Endurance increases exploration rad resistance, with immunity occurring at 11+ endurance. Despite what you'd think, and what makes logical sense, power armor provides no extra protection from anything and is no different than someone wearing pajamas. All that matters for outfit is their SPECIAL bonus.

## 7.6

**Q:** *How does weapon damage work?*

**A:** The damage numbers you see or what you get, remember that no SPECIALs or anything else affect it. All weapons have two damage numbers, a minimum and maximum. With single damage weapons that number is both the minimum and maximum. Weapons have an equal chance to deal any amount of damage within their range, so the best measure of effectiveness is comparing weapons by their average damage. For weapons with a range, add the two numbers up and divide by two to get the average. The game doesn't look at average damage when sorting weapons by damage, but rather what it does is sorts first by maximum damage and then only looks at minimum if maximum is tied. The game will therefore sort a 15-19 damage weapon in the equip menu as better than an 18 damage weapon, even though the average of the former is 17 compared to the 18 of the latter.
