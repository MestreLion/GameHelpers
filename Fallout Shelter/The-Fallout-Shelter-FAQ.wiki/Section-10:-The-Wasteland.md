## 10.1

**Q:** *How do SPECIALs affect exploration?*

**A:** Here are all the main points:

- Random quests found by explorers use quest mechanics, so PAL are your stats if you care about those, agility and luck being very important. See **[20.1](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests#201)** for the breakdown of SPECIAL during quests.

- Endurance is by far the most important, see **[4.1](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-4:-Dweller-Happiness-and-Health#41)** on dweller health. Having high health from having leveled with high endurance will greatly increase the survivability of any explorer. Endurance also provides radiation resistance in the wasteland (only the wasteland, not in the vault or while questing), and at 11+ endurance a dweller is immune. Even with rad immunity though it's still good to give them a few RadAway in case they stumble upon a random quest and need it.

- Luck is the stat used for determining how many caps an explorer finds. The amount of caps found linearly increases with luck, so focus on it if you really want caps.

- Perception is useful for finding weapons, outfits, and recipes. Junk is separate from these things and very different, but if you aren't concerned about junk then perception is your stat.

- All SPECIAL play a role in survivability. Explorers are put against many combat events on their trip, and all SPECIAL contribute in some way to success during these events. Dweller health and weapon damage are also obviously very key to survivability. Luck is actually the most important for survivability, with agility a near second. These two have a noticeable effect even when a dweller has a strong weapon. If a dweller has a weak weapon all SPECIAL have a noticeable effect, with agility and luck still being the most prominent. So ultimately if you're concerned about survivability try to max all SPECIAL with a focus on luck and agility (and don't forget about endurance for health).

- For junk the answer is different depending on a normal or survival vault. In the late game you'll probably only care about legendary junk for crafting. The short is that ECL are critical for legendary junk in a normal vault, where charisma is good at 10 and endurance and luck excel when as high as possible. Survivability is the only real concern for legendary junk in a survival vault, and as long as an explorer can make the full trip SPECIAL doesn't matter too much. See **[9.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-9:-Junk-and-Crafting#96)** for more information on legendary junk from exploration in normal and survival.

## 10.2

**Q:** *How do weapons and outfits affect exploration?*

**A:** Weapons only matter during combat events and random quests in the wasteland, and the more damage the better (see **[7.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-7:-Weapons-and-Outfits#76)** for weapon damage). Weapon damage is a huge determinant in how far an explorer will make it or how well they'll do on random quests, so try to give your explorers the best you can. See **[10.3](#103)** for a little more on the best weapon. Also, if you're curious about what enemies can be encountered in exploration see **[here](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4aqo90/so_they_couldnt_kill_a_scavengers_dog_but_a_yao/d12ywku)** for a table I made (huge thanks to TunderProsum for a lot of the information). I never got around to completing it, but the information that is there should still be accurate.

Outfits just add to SPECIAL, so see **[10.1](#101)** for the effect of SPECIAL during exploration, and **[10.4](#104)** for the breakdown on what outfits are best.

## 10.3

**Q:** *What's the best weapon for exploration?*

**A:** The more damage the better (see **[7.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-7:-Weapons-and-Outfits#76)** for weapon damage). If you care about random wasteland quests though, you might want to avoid giving them an AOE weapon so they can focus fire if needed (see **[20.2](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests#202)** for quest weapon types).

## 10.4

**Q:** *What's the best outfit for exploration?*

**A:** That greatly depends on what you're going for. Some people prefer something with at least +1E because that gives wasteland radiation immunity. With E10 they only need a few RadAway, but there is a glitch that seems to happen randomly where explorers don't use RadAway (see **[16.10](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-16:-Known-Bugs-and-Glitches#1610)**). 11 or more endurance ensures that glitch won't affect you.

The biggest concern for outfits otherwise is often legendary junk, see **[9.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-9:-Junk-and-Crafting#96)** for information there. To summarize, outfit really doesn't matter in survival so long as a dweller can survive the trip. Agility and luck help the most with surviving, so focus those. In normal though a focus on ECL is good for legendary junk (with charisma not really adding much past 10), so outfits that focus on endurance and luck are good. Furthermore, explorers can actually find more legendary junk with maxed ECL and minimum SPIA. For low SPIA and max ECL the following is good:

> Lucky Formal Wear > Detective Outfit (not craftable, can only get 1) > Heavy Wasteland Gear > Sheriff's Duster > T-60f Power Armor > Piper's Outfit ...

For max SPECIAL the following is good:

> Tunnel Snake's Outfit > Eulogy Jones' Suit > Heavy Wasteland Gear > Tenpenny's Suit > Piper's Outfit > Abraham's Relaxedwear > Lucky Formal Wear > Lucky Nightwear ...

However, if you care about random wasteland quests, you'll want high agility and luck. Perception doesn't really matter as with a bit of practice you can still get the x5 crit multiplier with low perception, but luck and especially agility are necessary to complete harder quests. In normal you might want to instead do low SPI and max ECAL.

## 10.5

**Q:** *What's the best pet for exploration?*

**A:** See **[8.2](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-8:-Pets#82)** on good pets. Wasteland Return Speed is always super useful, Wasteland Junk is super useful in survival (not so much in normal), and Damage, Health, and Damage Resistance are useful if you're concerned about explorer survivability. You can also use Objective Completion pets on explorers to help with any exploration related objectives.

## 10.6

**Q:** *Is it possible to find legendaries in the wasteland?*

**A:** It used to be possible and there were glitches that let you find them as well, however, **currently in the game it is 100% impossible to find legendary weapons and outfits in the wasteland**. You do however find legendary junk and recipes in the wasteland. You can sometimes find legendary weapons and outfits during high level quests, but not in random wasteland quests.

## 10.7

**Q:** *How many explorers can I have?*

**A:** 25 is the limit, plus 5 Mr. Handy robots (see **[12.3](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-12:-Mr.-Handy#123)**).

## 10.8

**Q:** *How many items can an explorer carry?*

**A:** 100, at which point they auto-return to the vault and you can't keep them exploring. You also can't tell them to drop all those stupid BB guns they decided would be useful. A small note, recipes for crafting do **not** count towards the carry limit. I did some testing on that **[here](https://en.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/4btgaf/explorer_carry_limit_does_not_include_recipes/)**. Only items that take storage room space in your vault count towards the limit, meaning that other things like lunchboxes and pet carriers found on random quests also don't count to the carry limit.

## 10.9

**Q:** *My explorer just equipped a worse weapon/outfit they found, why did they do that?*

**A:** Their definition of what's better is different from yours.

For weapons, as I say in **[7.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-7:-Weapons-and-Outfits#76)**, they auto-equip anything they consider better by looking at maximum damage first then minimum in the event of a tie. They do not look at average weapon damage, so it's possible for them to equip something they found that has a slightly lower average.

For outfits, they only look at total SPECIAL and switch out if whatever they just found offers more total SPECIAL. They don't switch if total SPECIAL is tied. So if you have someone with an outfit that provides +3 total and they find something with +5 total, they'll equip what they found. Switching out outfits can be a much larger pain than weapons, as they might switch out that +3E you gave them for health while they level up for some +5C pajamas they found, and you might not realize it right away. Even only a day out an explorer will probably find at least one rare outfit, and they definitely will if it's a 100 item trip, so be wary of what you give them. To avoid this:

- If you're not on Android or iOS, send explorers out with at least +5 total SPECIAL on their outfit. The highest total SPECIAL that can be found in the wasteland are +5 outfits.

- If you're on Android or iOS with the anniversary update, then there are +6 total SPECIAL rare outfits that can be found, meaning you need an outfit with at least +6. If you're using exploration for endurance leveling, there are no good rare endurance outfits with at least +6 total. In fact there are only two that offer any endurance, both from the update. The RobCo R&D Suit (2E, 4I) and Robot Armor (2S, 2E, 2L). Unfortunately this means to guarantee they don't swap for something with worse endurance, you pretty much need access to legendary outfits.

## 10.10

**Q:** *I saw my explorer find an item, but it's not in their inventory. What's going on?*

**A:** They auto-equipped it (see **[10.9](#109)**), and their old weapon/outfit will be in their inventory.

## 10.11

**Q:** *How do encounters work in the wasteland? Are the +X% wasteland weapons and outfits pets worth it?*

**A:** Short version, Wasteland Weapons and Outfits pets are **not** worth it.

Basically there are two kinds of events, fixed and repeatable. Repeatable occur roughly every 60 minutes, while fixed occur at fixed times of course. The fixed events have a specific SPECIAL stat associated with them, and the higher that explorer's stat the better the chance of getting a weapon, outfit, or recipe. The hourly event is a guaranteed find. Wasteland Weapons and Outfits pets add their percent chance of getting a second item if an explorer succeeds at an event, so because there are so many events for weapons and outfits during a trip the pet will get an explorer a lot more of each, meaning they hit 100 items and auto-return much sooner. The chance of getting legendary recipes and good rares is highest the further out you are, so if you want the good stuff don't use this pet. The pet is really only good at the start of the game when you're just looking for anything from the wasteland.

## 10.12

**Q:** *How does finding junk in the wasteland work? Are +X% wasteland junk pets worth it?*

**A:** See **[9.6](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-9:-Junk-and-Crafting#96)**.
