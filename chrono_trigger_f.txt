                                INTRODUCTION
                           =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Hello everyone! Welcome to my very first walkthrough/FAQ. I decided to create 
one for myself for many reasons, I want to prove that I can beat a game 
efficiently, I also want to prove that I can create a good Walkthrough/FAQ, 
and I also want to share to others what I have done and what have I seen so 
far regarding the game. I hope I can create this Walkthrough/FAQ well so that 
you won’t get lost in the game. Honestly, I prefer not to play a game from the 
beginning to the end using a walkthrough. Just play the game and if you 
somehow left yourself trapped or stuck in a particular place/event in the 
game, use this guide to help you.

Let’s talk about the game itself. In my opinion, Chrono Trigger is the best 
RPG ever to appear in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Console. It has 
the best sound track of an RPG game in the SNES console. And the storyline of 
the game is excellent. You’ll feel you’re a part of the game. Each character 
has his/her own story, and time periods as well. The story might not be clear 
at the beginning, but once you play through the game, you’ll see how good the 
story square came up with for Chrono Trigger. 

In the game, you’ll start off with Crono, a young boy from Truce Village. 
You’ll wake up at his house. He will go to Leene’s Square to meet his friend 
Lucca. When suddenly destiny calls upon him by receiving the pendant from a 
girl named Marle. Thus, the adventures of Crono and his friends through time 
begin. I won’t spoil the rest of the story for you so you’ll enjoy the game. 

One last thing, if you find any error at all, wrong places, wrong 
amount/item/equipments’ descriptions, grammatical errors, etc., please e-mail 
it to me so I can repair it and post it at once. Thank you and enjoy playing 
Chrono Trigger.

                               E-MAIL POLICY
                               =-=-=-=-=-=-=

For the past few months, I’ve been receiving such a great number of e-mails 
and some of them are quite annoying (very few though, just 2). So, I decided 
to put up this e-mail policy as a guide for you if you want to send an e-mail 
to me. Here are the things that you must do/must not do in sending an e-mail 
regarding this guide and any of my other guides:

Do’s
----
1. Send me a question, which cannot be found on my guide. I will be more that 
happy to help you.
2. Try to be specific in order for me to understand what you’re trying to ask 
me.
3. You can send in your questions/contributions/other e-mails in text or HTML 
format. No executables.
4. Check first if you have the latest version of this guide. If you asked a 
question in a previous version, the answer might already in a new version.

Don’ts
------
1. Don’t send any questions which is already answered in my guide.
2. Don’t send nonsense e-mails like “I want to marry you!”, “Can you buy me 
this or that?”, etc.
3. Don’t say bad words. F$#k Y%u! and the likes.
4. And, don’t send Chain letters! Please!
(Do any of these, and your e-mail will be most likely be ignored)
5. Don’t send executable files (.exe, .com) as an attachment. I don’t want any 
Trojans wandering around. Other files I won’t accept, .pif, .scr
6. Don’t Spam (repeated messages)

Change topic, for those who will send their contributions, I’ll always credit 
anything that is from you. I will always make sure of that. If I ever forget, 
please remind me nicely. :) I’ll always be there for all you gamers out there.

Final Version (Started: February 5, 2001)
-----------------------------------------
Well, that’s it for this guide. I finally am able to complete it after 7 and 
1/2 months. Thanks to all the readers and the contributors and most especially 
to CjayC. =) Because of him, my guide was posted and was, and is still helping 
people through the game. I also regard this guide as the best guide I’ve 
written. In contrary to my FF9 guide. That’s all. I won’t accept contributions 
anymore except for very important ones such as endings, if there are still 
more. So, c’ya everyone and thanks for the support!

     Select Button - Toggle Map
     L and R Buttons - Scroll down/up in menus respectively
                     - Move Time dial in Epoch
                     - There’s a part in the game where you use
                       the L and R buttons to advance to the next
                       story/event

The XYAB buttons will also be used in various mini-games and events in the 
game. If you have a turbo button capable Controller then you have an advantage 
on the different mini-games. I.e. push “A” as fast as you can, whereas in a 
turbo controller, you just have to hold it.

B. GAME MENUS
-------------

There are various menus that you can see in the game. Push the X button to 
open the menu. Here are the images of these menus and what they contain and 
do. It’ll also explain to you how to use them.

MAIN MENU
   - The main menu is the little horizontal bar in the middle.

   --------------------------------------

The 3 boxes to the left are the 3 characters on your party. The arrow point to 
the currently selected character. You can also view the other characters if 
you scroll down. The bottom left box shows the time and the amount of money 
you have. The large box contains information regarding the currently selected 
character. It has information regarding the character’s Level, Status, 
Equipments currently equipped, elemental affiliation, and Experience.

If you select a character and pressed the A button, you can change the 
equipments of that character. Just select between the weapon, helmet, armor, 
accessory, what you want to change. After you’ve selected weapon, for example. 
You’ll be shown the different weapons you’ve acquired that are compatible for 
the character you chose in the left window. You can select from the weapon 
list which one you want to want to equip. As you browse through the weapons, 
the box below will tell you of the abilities of the weapons. Example, Crono’s 
Red Katana. The horizontal box that appears below will show “Magic + 2” which 
is an ability given to Crono. Therefore, Crono’s Magic stat will rise by 2. 
Also, when you scroll you’ll see some stats of that character become Blue or 
Gray. If you put the cursor beside a weapon and a stat of your character turns 
to blue, it means that the weapon where your cursor is, is stronger that the 
weapon currently equipped, so I advise pressing A button to equip it. If it 
turns gray, it means the opposite. It is weaker. To return back to the main 
menu, just press the B or Cancel button.

ITEMS MENU
   - Here, you can see the list of items you currently have in your inventory

  --------------------------------
 | picture   Use/Move    Organize |
 |--------------------------------|
 | Restores 50 HP                 |

 |    MegaElixir :5   ITEM        |
 |    Heal       :99  ITEM        |
  --------------------------------

After you open the items menu, the cursor will point to the top item at once. 
You can see in this menu the items and their quantities. You can see at second 
horizontal bar the description about the item that is currently selected. If 
you press the B or Cancel button, the cursor will move to the Use/Move option 
on top. You can then choose between Use/Move and Organize. If you select 
organize, the items will be arranged in order from items, Weapons, Armors, 
Helmets, and Accessories. If you select the Use/Move option, you can choose an 
item and arrange the items yourself. There are 3 kinds of items, one that can 
be used only in battles, one that can be used only out of battles, and the 
other one can be used anytime. There are also the special items that are 
necessary to the story, like Marle’s Pendant. To use an item, you must press 
the A button twice. If you pushed the A button once, another cursor will 
appear. If you move the second cursor to another item and pressed A, those 
items will then exchange places. So, that’s how the item menu works.

TECHS MENU
   - In here you can view all the techniques your characters have learned so 
far. You can use some healing techs out of battle also

  |---------------------------------|
  |           Single Tech           |
   ---------------------------------

Once you’ve opened the Techs window, the cursor will point to a character. If 
you press left or right on the directional pad, you can view the character’s 
Single, Dual and Triple Techs. 1,2,3 Respectively. If you press the A button, 
the cursor will be brought to the Techs on the right box. You will be shown 
the ability and the MP requirement of the currently selected Technique. By the 
way, the -P- before the character is the picture of that character. 

You can also use some Techs out of battle. For example, Marle’s Aura Tech. 
Just select it from the Tech list of Marle and press A to use it. You will 
know if you can use a Tech out of battle if it is colored Yellow. 

A “*” before the Tech denotes that, that specific Tech uses Magic.

CONFIGURATION MENU
- you set various configurations of the game.

You can see many options here. Their description are as follows:

A. Stereo
   - Toggle Stereo Sound On/Off
B. Battle Speed
   - Set the Battle and Message Speed. The lower the number highlighted,
     the faster it is. 
   - to set the Speed, select B from the left box and the cursor will
     go to the b in the right box allowing you to modify the speed
C. Battle Mode
   - Toggle Battle Mode to Wait/Active
   - “Active” mode means that the computer will not wait for you to 
     finish your move. It will continue attacking you even while selecting
     an item. Recommended for Expert players who move fast.
   - “Wait” mode means that the computer will wait for you to finish your
     move. While you’re attacking, selecting Items/Magic/Techs, the enemy’s
     bar will stop. 
D. Window Color
   - Change the color of the Menu Window
E. Save Menu Cursor
   - The save menu cursor means the cursor will be where you left it when you 
     exit the menu, when it is off and you exit the menus and then re-enter,
     it will have the character menu selected, if it was on and you were in
     another menu when you exited, it will then be that menu.
     (Thanks to Razer107@aol.com for this info)
F. Battle Gauge
   - Select Battle Gauge type or turn it off.
G. Save Battle Cursor
   - This is almost the same as the Save Menu Cursor. For example, you used a 
     Tech for Crono. In Crono’s next turn, the cursor will be pointing at 
     Tech. In short, it will point to one of the selections in the battle 
     menu, which you used in the previous turn. 
     (Thanks to Razer107@aol.com for this info)
H. Control Pad
   - Toggle Standard/Custom Control Pad Configuration

     of configuration
I. Save Skill/Item Cursor
   - Almost the same as the Battle Cursor, except that it will copy the
     items and Tech you used in the previous battle and it will be
     used in the next battle. Again, please correct me if I’m wrong.
J. Skill/Item Info

--------------
C. GAME BASICS
--------------

Here are the basic things you have to do in Chrono Trigger to finish the game.
 
Moving around the world

   - Chrono Trigger is an RPG, so like other RPG, you have to go to places, 
meet new people, seek help from people, defeat the bad guys and emerge 
victorious. The story is so enticing that you may forget to sleep while 
playing. 
   There are many ways to explore the land. You can walk, teleport, and fly. 
Remember while exploring and moving on through the story, get all the items 
you can see as every one of them will be of help to you. And last but not the 
least, talk to everyone to gain information on what to do next. Do this if you 
got stuck. If you’re really stuck even after talking to everyone, use this 
walkthrough.

Attacking/Battle Information

   - Attacking is the most basic thing you have to do in almost every game 
today. In Chrono Trigger there are 2 types of enemies. One that will attack 
you only if you go near them and the other will attack you even if you don’t 
want to (i.e. bosses). When the battle menu appears, the battle gauge of each 
character will slowly fill up. Once filled, the character who owns the bar 
will have the opportunity to attack the enemy (there are cases where you can’t 
control your character even the bar is full, refer to the status 
ailments/abilities section later in the walkthrough. When the bar is full, you 
can attack, use a Tech or use an item. After that character’s turn, his/her 
battle gauge will be emptied. Be aware that the enemy also has his/her/it’s 
own battle gauge. Some enemies are so fast that they will attack you right 
from the start of the battle. 
   - there are also many form of attacks that you can do. There are attacks 
that damage only one enemy. There are damages that affect every enemy on 
screen, examples are the Level 2 Magic Attacks. There are attacks that affect 
only enemies in a line. Example, Crono’s Slash Attack. It affects enemies that 
form a straight light whatever direction it may be.    

Equipments

   - Equipments will determine how strong your character can attack, how can 
your characters withstand an attack, and how your characters can inflict 
status ailments at enemies. It is essential in beating the game. So, if you 
happen to be in a Weapon Shop and have lots of Gs, then I suggest you buy that 
item/equipment/accessories. Remember also that some equipments have abilities 
(refer later to the Status Ailments/Abilities section). And the most important 
thing to remember in equipping weapons, armors, helmets, is that some of them 
are compatible to one character only. Example, Crono’s weapons cannot be used 
by anyone else. 

Items

   - Items are very important as they assist your battle when your HPs are low 
and there’s no healer around. Some items are so important that you can’t 
finish the game without it. Example, Marle’s Pendant. It will be automatically 
be in your inventory, but imagine if you don’t have it. You won’t be able to 
reach some important places in the game. 

-------------------
D. CHARACTER STATUS
-------------------

When you open the menu, select the Character/Party/Game Information menu. 
You’ll see here the Status of your character. Keep in mind that Character 
Status is different from Status Ailments/Abilities. Refer to the Game Menu 
section of this walkthrough regarding the different sub-menus. 

Now, in the Character/Party/Game menu, you’ll see the different numbers in the 
lower right corner of the right box. You’ll see the following:

Pwr.     Spd.
Hit.     Ev.
Mag.     Stam.
M Def.

Pwr. Stands for Power. It determines the character’s attacking power using 
his/her weapon.

Spd. Stands for Speed. It determines how fast the Battle gauge will fill up. 
The faster the Battle gauge fills, the fast the character moves.

Hit. Stands for Hit Rate. It determines the probability of you characters to 
do a critical hit. Take note also that your characters have a success rate of 
100% for physical attack. It’s just that the enemies have high evade% that 
your attacks will miss.

Ev. Stands for Evade. It determines the chances of your character to evade 
attacks. If it says “99”, it means that your character has a 99% chance of 
evading the attack.

Mag. Stands for Magic Power. It determines how strong your character’s Magic 
Spells are. The higher the Magic Power the bigger damage you inflict on 
enemies using Magic. 

Stam. Stands for Stamina. It determines the Physical Defense of your character 
from a physical attack from the enemy.

M Def. Stands for Magic Defense. It determines the Magical Defense of your 
character from a magic attack from an enemy.

Now, you know how strong your character is. Look at the EXP below. It tells 
you the total amount of EXP your character has gained throughout the game. 
Next, means the total no. of experience points needed by your character to 
gain a level, making him/her stronger. 

Take note that if any of these stats are at **. It means that it is already in 
it’s Maximum. 

Here is the Maximum Character Status in the game.

Level: 99

E. STATUS AILMENTS/ABILITIES
----------------------------

Status Ailments can also be called Abnormal Status in the sense that it makes 
your character do unnecessary moves or even lower the characters ability to 
fight. Status abilities, on the other hand, raise the capabilities of your 
characters during battle. Here are the list of Status Ailments and Abilities.

STATUS AILMENTS
these make your character’s life miserable. Ailments will hinder you from 
playing well, especially in battles.

            movement/turn.                    yet tested)

STATUS ABILITIES
Status abilities can help a lot during battle. It raises the Abilities of your 
characters and some alter some aspects of the game to help you. Some of them 
are Magic, but you can find most of them in weapons/armors/helmets and 
especially the accessories.

Name        Effect on Character
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absorbs “x” - “x” is any type of element. Every time “x” (elem. Type) is used
  Hits      against you, the damage will be added to your HP instead of
            Losing it
Cuts “E”    - E stands for element. Example, Fire. If a fire attack is used 
- by “%”  against that character with the Cuts “Fire” by “50%”, that 
            character will only obtain half, or 50% of the total damage.
Evade + x   - Increases the chances your characters can evade an attack by
            x%
Haste       - Increases the Speed of your character making him/her, attack
            and turn fast.
Magic + x   - Increases the character’s Magic Power by x. For the kids, here’s
            An example. If you see Magic + 2 then x is equal to 2. It means
            That x will hold the number 2 and therefore raises your 
            character’s magic power by 2.
Power + x   - Increases the Physical Attack of your character by x.
Protects    - This will prevent your character from being infected by
  Status    status Ailments. All ailments except for Lock All.
Speed + x   - Increases the Speed of your character by x. This allow your 
            Character to attack fast. He/she will also gain more turns 
            Than the enemy.
Stamina + x - Increases the Physical Defense of your character by x. This will
            lower the damage from physical attacks of the enemies.
Strike + x  - Increases the hit Rate of the character by x. This will add to 
            The success rate of an attack
Vigor + x   - The same as Stamina + x
X Evade     - Evade is the ability of the character to make an enemy’s attack 
            miss. If X is equal to 2, then the Evade Status of the character
            will be doubled.
 
-------------------------  
F. MAGIC AND THE ELEMENTS
-------------------------

As with most of the RPGs, Chrono Trigger also involves the Elements. There are 
4 elements in the game, Fire, Lightning, Water/Ice (counted as 1), Shadow. 
Many enemies, especially bosses, are affiliated with a specific type of 
element. You can beat the enemy easily by using the opposite element against 
it. Example, a Fire elemental enemy, use Ice or Water against them to beat 
them easily. The same also applies for defense, example, you have to use a 
fire elemental armor to defend against a fire elemental attack. Be aware that 
you’ll see some enemies where you have to use the same element as they have to 
damage them. And, last but absolutely not the least. There are enemies that 
are impervious to Magic attacks. 

Here’s the list of elemental affiliations with the characters in the game.
Crono - Lightning
Marle - Ice
Lucca - Fire
Frog  - Water
Magus - Shadow
Robo  - Shadow-like (No Magic abilities)
Ayla  - no Magic abilities, therefore no affiliation

You can learn how to use Magic when you first arrive at the End of Time. The 
Old Man will tell you to visit the room behind him and you’ll see Spekkio. 
When you first meet him, he will give your characters’ Magic. Then, he will 
ask your party if you want to try your magic. If you want to, you can fight 
him using magic only. Physical attacks are useless. He will have different a 
different fighting level, depending on the level of your party. If the highest 
level of your characters is 20 then, Spekkio will be level 20 also and will 
change form every 20th level. I.e. Level 1-19 he will Spekkio, Level 20-39 he 
will change into a different monster and will have much stronger attacks and 
defense. Don’t worry when you lose, the game will not be over. Your HP/MP will 
be fully restored but you won’t get a prize. The prize you get depends on the 
level of Spekkio. I’ll try to put up here the different levels of Spekkio on 
the next update. I’ll repeat the game again!

When you face an enemy with elemental attribute, you should always use the 
magic that is the opposite of that enemy’s element. Example, a monster that is 
aligned to Fire Elemental, use an Ice Magic attack to deal a huge amount of 
damage to it. It’s opposite for Defense. If an enemy uses a certain elemental 
magic, for example Ice, if you have an armor, a helmet or an accessory that is 
also Water/Ice affiliated.

-----------------------
G. HOW TO GET/USE TECHS
-----------------------

Techs or Techniques are different abilities you can use during battle which 
use your MP. When you use a Tech, that character will launch a special attack 
on the enemy but it requires MP to be used. Example, Crono’s Luminaire, which 
uses up 20 MPs. If you have 19 MP left, you cannot use Luminaire. However, if 
it is 20 and above, you can freely use the Tech. 

Some techs are Magic attacks like Fire, Fire2, Ice , Ice2, etc. Each of the 
characters has his/her own ultimate tech. Crono has Luminaire, Lucca has 
Flare, Marle’s is Life2, Magus has the Dark Matter, Frog has Frog Squash, Ayla 
has Triple Kick, and Robo has Shock. I remind you also that majority of these 
ultimate techs consume 20 MPs. Marle’s and Frog’s use 15 MP and Robo’s use 17 
MP. 

I you want to unlock a Tech of a character, you must do them in order of how 
powerful the Tech is. Example, you cannot unlock fire2 without fire. And, each 
of the Techs can be unlocked by gaining the required number of TP or Tech 
points during battles. If the TP required drops to 0, you’re character will 
learn that Tech right away. 

There are techs that can be combined. 2 Characters can combine their powers by 
using Dual Techs to deal more damage to the enemy. There are also Techs that 
allows all 3 of your party members to combine their power to attack the 
enemies. Some however require a certain item that will activate the Triple 
Tech.

        =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-



BEGINNING
---------
At the title screen select a new game. Or, if you already finished the game 
select the New Game+ Option (for more information about this, head to the New 
Game+ Information section of this Walkthrough/FAQ). After selecting, you will 
be asked what battle mode you want. Select active if you want challenge. The 
enemies here will not wait for you to finish your move. If you want a more 
strategic battle, select the Wait Battle Mode. This will allow you to make 
your move first before the enemy does. After selecting the Battle Mode. Name 
our Hero. For the sake of the Walkthrough, let’s use his default name, Crono.

CRONO’S HOUSE (1000 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   200G

The start of the game will bring you to Crono’s room. After Crono wakes up, 
head down the stairs. Crono’s Mom will forget your friends’ name. For this 
walkthrough, let’s use her default name, Lucca. Talk to Crono's Mom again 
before leaving the house for 200G allowance. Exit Crono's House to the World 
Map.

MAYOR’S MANOR (1000 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   100G
   300G
   Tonic

Go southwest a little to one of the houses, and enter the Mayor's Manor. You 
can learn about Weapons and Items, save points, use of shelters, Techniques or 
Techs, and tips about how the battle system works and how to use the buttons 
by speaking to the different people here. Before leaving the manor, take the 
Tonic in a chest in the lower floor and take the money (100G) inside the chest 
on the second floor. Don’t forget to talk to the man in the middle TWICE and 
he’ll give you 300G. (Thanks to Brandon Boucher for the info) Return to World 
Map.

LEENE’S SQUARE (1000 AD)
------------------------

You may visit the other houses to gain more info or just talk. Then, head to 
the north of Crono's house to Leene’s Square.

There are A LOT of things that you can do here in Leene Square. Upon entering, 
you may be wondering why you couldn't talk to a few characters that are 
running around (they are busy racing against each other so they won’t bother 
talking to you). There are also stalls here that sell items, equipment, and 
accessories. Also, remember that the currency that Leene Square uses is silver 
points. You can obtain silver points by winning them from the different fun 
mini-games.

First of all, don't talk to anyone yet and head north to the next section of 
Leene Square. Walk up to the girl that is running around Leene's Bell. Upon 
bumping into her, check up on her first then take the pendant. Talk to her and 
let’s name her Marle, which is the her default name. Return her pendant and 
let her join you. Upon joining, you can now have fun in Leene Square. Note: 
don't talk to anyone yet.

Here are the mini-games that you may play here at Leene’s Square that includes 
the rules and the requirements in playing.

1. Ring the Bell!
     Found in the Southwestern portion of the first section of Leene’s 
     Square. Your goal is to time it right that Crono can ring the bell.
     If you win, you’ll receive 1 Silver Point. Note that this is the 
     second easiest game here at Leene’s Square.

2. Guess the Winner!
     It can be found in the first section of Leene’s Square. Talk to the
     person standing in the blue tent, which is to the right of the fountain
     In the middle. He will let you guess who will be the winner in the next
     race. The racers’ names are, G.I. Jogger (G.I. Joe), Steel Runner 
     (Armored Knight), Green Ambler (Alien), and Catalack (a Cat!). If you 
     try to talk to him while the race is going on, he will not entertain
     you. Wait for the race to finish before talking to the man. If you win
     the man will give you 20 Silver Points as a prize. It’s hard to guess
     who the winner is, right? Notice the old man near the Starting Line?
     He will guess who the winner will be in the next race. He will sometimes
     be wrong but most probably, he will make a correct guess. So, if you’re
     tired of guessing, talk to the old geezer BEFORE A RACE for a hint. 

3. Norstein Bekkler’s Lab
     Located in the eastern portion of the first section of Leene’s Square.
     It is in a large pink tent with a skull at the entrance. This place is 
     pure fun. First, select the amount of silver points you want to bet.
     10, 40, or 80 Silver Points can be placed as bet.

     At 10 Silver Points, you get to play a game where you must find a 
     certain person among the 3. They are Vicks, Wedge, and Piette. They will
     change places fast. To have an advantage, memorize 2 persons only. 
     Example, watch Vicks and Wedge’s movement. When the clown asks you where
     Vicks or Wedge, you’ll be able to identify the 2. The one whom you
     didn’t follow his movement will be Piette. If you win, you’ll get a 
     Poyozo Doll to use as decoration for Crono’s House. Note that these
     Poyozo Dolls play a major role in the late part of the game. It does not
     necessarily mean that the Poyozo Dolls in Crono’s house will play that
     important part, you will eventually encounter more Poyozo Dolls on the
     way. Note also, that the Poyozo Dolls on the second floor of Crono’s 
     house will change the music if you examine it. Tip: Pick the Soldier
     that is farthest from the two. Credit goes to Brandon Boucher.

     At 40 Silver Points, you get to play a mimic game. All you have to do     
     is to Mimic or Copy the movement of the clone using the designated
     buttons, L=Left Arm, R=Right Arm, Y=Laugh, A=Surprise. If you managed
     to mimic everything, you’ll win a Clone of Crono that you can use also   
     to decorate Crono’s House. Take note that this Clone will play a MAJOR
     role in the game. If you think hard you’ll know it. 

     At 80 Silver Points, you get to play a Push the monster game. Your goal
     in this game is to prevent your character, who is hanged just above a
     flame, and push the 3 coins to be able to put monsters into the door at
     the back. It’s very challenging. You’re pushing the coins at the same
     time preventing your character from being fried. If you see a blue light
     Appear at your left side, examine it to raise the rope a bit, then 
     continue pushing those monsters back. If you win, you’ll get a cat.
     These cats will be brought to Crono’s House. You can win as many cats 
     as you want. When you go to Crono’s house, you’ll see all the cats 
     you’ve won roaming around the house.

4. Soda Guzzling Contest
     This is found in the eastern portion of the second section of Leene’s
     Square. Your goal is to drink up 8 cans of Soda within a certain time
     limit. Press the A button as fast as you can to drink the cans. Turbo
     enabled controllers have the advantage here. All they have to do is to
     hold the A button, therefore making this game the easiest one. If you
     managed to drink the 8 cans, you’ll receive 5 Silver Points.

5. Beat Gato!
     In the second section of Leene’s Square, head all the way to the west
     past the old man until you reach Lucca’s Demo Robot, Gato. This mini-
     game will train your characters in battle. If you managed to beat Gato,
     which I’m sure you will, you’ll receive 10 Experience Points and 15
     Silver Points. All you have to do is to attack! If you lose, play 
     Another game! Just kidding. :)  (Note: If you return here with Ayla, 
     You can charm Gato and receive a Power Meal)

Now, back to the walkthrough. After you’ve played these mini-games, you can 
visit the Tribal Dance. It is located to the Northeast of the second section 
of Leene’s Square. You can push the buttons to make your characters dance, 
laugh, and even surprise them.

Now, there are certain things at Leene’s Square that you can do that will 
affect a certain event later in the game. You can do them in any order you 
want, but this is the best way, I think.

1. Go to Melchior (Weapons Merchant and Swordsmith in the first section of 
Leene’s Square) who is near a woman. Talk to the woman first then talk to 
Melchior. He’ll sell his items to you then he will ask if you could persuade 
Marle into selling her pendant. Say NO! 

2. In the western area of the 2nd section, you'll see and old man walking and 
a pack of lunch/food on a table. Don't ever take it. Just leave it there 
because you might actually be tempted to get it.

3. Head to the Eastern area of the 2nd Section, you'll find a girl who lost 
her cat. Remember a cat near the old man? Examine it and you'll hear a mew. It 
will then follow you wherever you go. Lead it to the girl then talk to the 
girl and she’ll be glad to have her cat back.

Back to the main story. Head to the fountain at the center of the 1st section 
of Leene’s Square. Talk to the girl sitting there. After talking to her, it 
will be announced that Lucca and her dad finished their invention. Go north to 
the 2nd section. Head north. Upon reaching the stairs to the 3rd section, 
Marle will tell you that she wants to buy some candies. While she is buying 
the candies, don't push a single button. In other words, don't even try to 
move away from her while she is busy buying the candy. This certain event will 
also affect the same event in the later part of the game (the one I talked 
about a while ago regarding those 3 things you need to do). Then, after buying 
the candies head north to the 3rd section. Upon reaching the 3rd section, 
you'll see the introduction of Taban about their invention, the teleportation 
device (wow! I ought to have one!). Upon regaining control of your characters, 
talk to Lucca. You will be asked by her to try out their invention. Step into 
the left pod. All goes well (by the way, you can try and try the device to 
your hearts’ content). 

Note: If you are in the New Game+ Mode, you’ll notice a shining dot in the 
right pod of Lucca’s Device. If you examine it now, you’ll fight Lavos right 
away in the hardest level of the game. You have to fight Lavos ALONE. :) 
There’s a new ending waiting for you if you do this. Check out Ending #2.

Then talk to Marle. When Marle tries the device something wrong happens. Her 
pendant reacts to the device and a portal or a gate will appear and will suck 
her into it. Upon regaining control of Crono, step into the left pod and take 
the pendant. Crono then decides to follow Marle to find out what happened to 
her. Lucca tells Crono that she will follow them later after she discovers 
what caused this event. Crono will be sucked into the gate and will travel 
through time! Now the real adventure of Crono will begin!

TRUCE CANYON (600 AD)
---------------------
Item/s:
   Tonic
   Power Glove

Upon exiting the gate, you will be greeted by 3 imps. You can easily beat them 
w/ normal attacks. No problem at all. Head northwest to the next section. You 
will meet a batch of 2 Imps. It’s easy. There are also items that can be found 
in this area. A Tonic and a Power Glove. When you see imps playing, just pass 
through them quietly. Don’t go near them and they’ll not attack you. Just head 
south to exit to the World Map. You’ll see that the place is different from 
your time, 1000 AD because you’re in 600 AD!

GUARDIA KINGDOM (600 AD)
------------------------

You can visit the residents of Truce Village. You can buy equipments/item from 
the Market. You can also see Lucca’s ancestors in one of the residences here. 
You can see them forging Leene’s Bell (w/c you saw at Leene’s Square 1000 AD). 
After talking to the villagers and buying anything you want, head to the 
Guardia Forest just south of the Castle.

NOTE: Don’t go to the bridge as you can’t pass through here yet. Also, don’t 
go to the cathedral yet.

GUARDIA FOREST (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Power Tab
   Shelter

There are also many item’s here. At the first intersection, head left. At the 
next intersection, w/c is almost right after the first one, head to the lower 
path. There are two shining dots here. The Northern one contains a Power Tab 
as for the southern one, you’ll just invite 2 Roly riders. After getting the 
Power Tab head back to the intersection and take the upper path. Don’t mind 
the left path of the first intersection, it will meet with the north path of 
the second intersection. While walking, you’ll notice 2 bushes that are 
moving. The one on the right will house a monkey-like monster w/c will give 
you a shelter. You can always exit to the World Map and return here and get 
another shelter from him and as many time as you like. The other moving bush 
has monster in it. So ignore it, or fight it for EXP. Next, continue on until 
you come to another intersection where one path is to the north and the other 
to the east. Head to the north, the east past only contains a sealed chest. 
Exit to the World Map.

GUARDIA CASTLE (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Tonic
   Ether
   100G
   Bronze Mail

Upon entering the castle the guards will stop you when suddenly a familiar 
person will come and lets you pass (it’s so obvious who she is). In the throne 
room, talk to King Guardia XXI. He will give you permission to sleep in the 
Knight’s Quarters that is to the left of the entrance then go down the stairs 
you’ll see. The other path will lead you to the kitchen. After resting, if 
necessary, head to the throne room and take the right path up to the Queen’s 
Room. On your way up, you’ll see a chest with a Tonic. Upon reaching the Room 
of the Queen, talk to the guard and he will give you access to the room. Take 
the chest with an Ether first then, head to the queen and talk to her. Then, 
Marle will feel something then she will disappear! She ceases to exists!

After Marle disappears, head down to the throne room. On the way, you’ll meet 
with Lucca. She will tell you that Marle is actually Princess Nadia of the 
Guardia Kingdom in 1000 AD. And she was mistaken as Queen Leene therefore the 
King stopped the search for the real Queen Leene w/c is actually held captive 
somewhere. Lucca explains that Marle disappeared because Queen Leene will be 
killed by the hostage-takers because they will think that the King has no more 
interest in rescuing the Queen in which the king only mistook Marle for her. 
So Marle do not exist anymore (whaaa!). So your mission now is to look for the 
missing Queen Leene to save both her and Marle. Before leaving the castle, be 
sure to take a rest at the Knight’s Quarters. Also, to the left of the throne 
room, there’s a set of stairs leading to the Kings room. On the way, you’ll 
find a chest with 100G, then you’ll see a sealed chest w/c you can’t do 
anything right now, and finally a Bronze Mail in the King’s room. You may now 
exit to the World Map.

GUARDIA FOREST (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Shelter

There's nothing much here as you have been here already. Just take another 
shelter then head south and exit to the World Map.

CATHEDRAL (600 AD)
------------------
Item/s:
   Revive           Power Tab       Shelter
   3 Tonics         100G            Iron Sword
   Maiden Suit      Speed Belt      Mid-Ether
   2 Ethers         Defender
   Steel Saber      Heal

In the World Map, head west to another forest which fortunately, you can pass 
freely. Enter the Cathedral. Upon entering, it seems like the ordinary church 
with nuns. But observe the statements of those nuns, they’re not nun-like at 
all. Speak to them all then examine the shining dot at the altar, which is the 
coral pin of the real Queen Leene. Then, the nuns reveal themselves as Naga-
ettes and will attack your party. After you beat them, another will come in to 
surprise Lucca. A Frog will then come to Lucca’s rescue. Go with him and name 
him Frog. After joining, check the organ to open a passageway. Upon entering, 
ignore the door to your north and head left. Get the 2 chests with Revive and 
Tonic. Enter the next door you see then head up the stairs and enter the room 
right after the stairs. Get the Maiden Suit, Tonic, and Ether. Then examine 
the egg-like thing on the left of the room w/c is a Naga-Ette Bromide. 3 
Henches will attack you. Beat them then exit the room. Don’t go down the 
stairs, head right then up to a chest with Steel Saber. Head left to the 
spikes and examine the skull to the left. The spikes will be removed and you 
can now enter the door. Talk to the guard then take the Shining Power Tab. 
Exit the room then head back the stairs and go down. Don’t enter the door, go 
left past the Main Hall Way. Head up the next set of stairs. Enter the first 
door you see and talk to all 3 of the creatures here. Talk to them until the 
Diablos leaves the room to go to Magus’ Statue. Follow it. Upon entering a 
room, talk to the king, the soldier, and the queen. After talking to them, get 
the chests for 100G and Ether.

Head to the right door to enter Magus’ statue. Get the chests for Speed Belt 
and Defender Accessories. Leave the 2 rooms. If you try to leave the room of 
the king, they’ll turn to Gnashers and attacks you. Head down the stairs and 
pass through the Main Hallway and enter the door on top. In the next room, use 
the Save Point. Head up the stairs, don’t enter the door and head left. Get 
the Chest for a shelter then use the stairs down. Enter the door. In the next 
room, (with bats) don’t examine the Skull because it will invite 2 more bats. 
Enter the north door. Move on and get the Tonic and Heal inside the chests. 
Continue left then down one room wherein you’ll see another room with a skull. 
Examine it to lower the spikes. Then, head down one room and go up the stairs. 
Take the door in the middle (I suggest you save). Defeat the monsters and take 
the chest for an Iron Sword. Examine the organ to reveal a room on the north 
side of this area that is beside a note. You can take any of the 2 stairs to 
reach that door. Upon entering the door, you’ll reach another hallway. Follow 
it then use the Save Point. Enter the Door. Meet the first boss:

Boss:  YAKRA
#############################################################################
HP:  900-1000 
EXP: 50
TP:  5
G:   600
Charmed Item: not possible

To beat him, use Crono and Frog’s Dual Tech X Strike to deal a big damage to 
him. Use items with Lucca to heal everyone. If everyone’s HP goes down, Let 
everyone use Tonics then continue on with X Strike until he dies.
#############################################################################

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ Please take note that the HP of the bosses are my estimates only, I  \
/ computed the total damage I did to the boss until it died. So, these \
/ HPs are enough to beat that particular boss.                         \
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

After beating him, get the right chest for a Mid-Ether. Check the other chest, 
which contains the real Chancellor. Talk to Queen Leene Afterwards then you’ll 
be back automatically to Guardia Castle.

GUARDIA CASTLE (600 AD)
-----------------------

You’ll start off in the throne room with the King, Queen, and the Chancellor. 
After Frog leaves, talk to Queen Leene. She’ll ask you about Marle. Return to 
where Marle disappeared. After Marle reappears, answer her back with the 
“Wrong!” Option. I think it also affects a future event. After Marle joins 
you, go back to the throne room and talk to everyone to hear their reactions 
about Marle. Then, exit and you’ll see Frog. After Frog leaves (again), take a 
time to rest in the Knight’s Quarters for free. Then, exit the Castle to the 
World Map.

GUARDIA FOREST (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Shelter

Again, take the Shelter from the monster! Exit to World Map. It’s now time to 
return to the present time.

TRUCE CANYON (600 AD)
---------------------

Go to Truce Canyon and go to where the portal is. Lucca will show off his gate 
key that can open these portals so it can be used if needed. You’ll then 
teleport back to Leene’s Square 1000 AD.

LEENE’S SQUARE (1000 AD)
------------------------

Once back, Lucca will leave and Marle will ask you if you can escort her home. 
After regaining control of your characters, you can play with the games as 
much as you want, then afterwards exit to the World Map.

Note: If you’re in the new game+ mode, you can examine the shining dot in the 
right pod of Lucca’s Device to fight Lavos. You’ll fight Lavos with Crono and 
Marle only. The ending here will be quite amusing. Check out Ending #3. 

MARKET (TRUCE VILLAGE 1000 AD)
------------------------------

You’ll find new equipments here to buy them if you have the G. Exit to the 
World Map.

MAYOR’S MANOR (1000 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   300 G

Head to the Mayor’s Manor and talk to the Mayor on the second floor. He will 
not only give you hints but also a small amount of 300G. Return to World Map 
and go to Guardia Forest.

GUARDIA FOREST (1000 AD)
------------------------
Items/s:
   Power Tab

Here, you’ll not see the Monster that carries a shelter. You’ll face some new 
enemies here also. There some new items here also. In the place where you 
found 2 shining dots, a new Power Tab can be found shimmering near the trees 
to the left. You can now exit to north because there aren’t any more items 
here.

GUARDIA CASTLE (1000 AD)
------------------------
Item/s:
   3 Ethers         1500G
   8 Mid-Tonics
   Bronze Mail
   2 Shelters
   Lode Sword

Upon entering you’ll be greeted with a very cold greeting from the Chancellor 
of this castle. He will think that you kidnapped the princess. You will be 
detained and taken to court. In this court scene, your verdict will be based 
on what you did to the princess and the people at Leene’s Square. Remember 
those things that would affect a future event? This is that particular event. 
Again, your verdict will be based on a couple of things:

1. After you bump into Marle, check on her first before taking the pendant.
2. Don’t talk Marle into selling her pendant to Melchior (equipment shop).
3. Don’t take the old man’s pack of food.
4. Bring the kitty back to the young girl.
5. Wait for Marle to finish buying her candies.

When the Chancellor asks you who started it, tell him it was you. Then when he 
asks you if you were tempted with her fortunes, tell him “no” and “not at 
all”. With this, you’ll be proven innocent. But it’s just the same if you were 
guilty. Here’s what will happen. If you are innocent you’ll be given a maximum 
penalty of 3 Days Solitary Confinement (the Chancellor with stir up the system 
and tells the guard that you will be executed even if you are innocent. He 
wants Crono dead). If you are proven guilty you’ll be detained and executed 
within 3 days. 

In the detention cell, you’ll find a cup which will restore your all your HP 
and MP. If you are innocent, there will be a pack that will contain an ether. 
You can also use the Save Point. Now, don’t go near the door. Just stand still 
and WAIT for three days to pass. If you irritate the guards they will attack 
you and you’re free but you will only be able to meet Lucca before the Boss. 
If you wait for 3 days, you will be brought to the execution room. When the 
guillotine is ready, Lucca will come in and save you. You can now use Lucca 
until you reach the boss. She can gain EXP so the boss will become easier. 
Here’s the description of the 2 ways on how you can reach the boss:

1. If you break you way out
   After defeating the Guards, leave the detention hall. You’ll arrive at a 
place where there are 4 stairs. First, don’t mind the 2 enemies here just pass 
by them. Just head to the lower right stairs the continue on until you see a 
guard. Beat him and examine the switch to open the room. You’ll find Mid-Tonic 
x2, Ether x2. Leave the area and return to the 4-stair room. On your way out, 
you’ll see Omnicrone. Just deal a certain amount of damage (218 HP) to him and 
he’ll escape. Then, move on and beat those 2 Blue Shields to gain access to 
the 2 stairs. The strategy is simple, wait for them to show their bodies then 
slash away with your sword. Don’t go to the upper left stairs because you’ll 
only have a fight here. So, head to the upper right stairs. On the small 
bridge, 2 guards’ll attack you. They’re easy. Beat them and move on until you 
reach an intersection. Head left and beat another Guard to enter the execution 
room. Help the man in the Guillotine and he’ll tell you about his shop at 
Truce Village. Then, get the chest (Mid Tonic) and examine the switch to the 
north to open the door. Move north and get the chest for a Bronze Mail. 2 
Decedents will attack you. Beat them then return to the intersection and head 
north. Move on until you reach the second 4-stair room. Head to the lower-left 
stair first and get the chest with a shelter in the right room. Head back to 
the 4-stair room and beat the Blue Shields again. Head to the upper left stair 
and exit through the hole in the second room. You’ll now be at the walls of 
the castle. You can now reach the chest, in which its room cannot be opened, 
for a shelter. There will be another hole in the ground. Get in and get the 
chests below for a Lode Sword and 1500G. You can return up by examining the 
wall where you climbed down. After getting the chests, return to the second 4-
stair room. Head to the upper right exit now. Move on until Lucca saves you. 
You can now see a save point and the Manual which gives info about your next 
boss. Read it then SAVE. Examine the Supervisor whom Lucca Blasted. You’ll 
receive 5 Mid Tonics. Go to “Continuation (Trial)”..

2. If you waited for 3 days to pass
   If you waited for 3 days, you will be taken to the execution room. Just 
before you are executed, Lucca comes and saves the day. Upon regaining control 
of your characters, get the chest for a Bronze Mail. Head down to the next 
room and save the man from the Guillotine. He’ll tell you about his shop at 
Truce Village. Next, get the chest for a Mid tonic then leave the execution 
room. In the intersection, head left first. Move on until you reach a 4-stair 
room. Don’t worry about the upper left stairs. You’ll only see an enemy there. 
Now, beat those 2 Blue Shields. The lower left stairs will lead you to the 
detention cell of Crono. You can restore your HP/MP by using the cup and save 
the game! Next, return to the 4-stair room and head down the lower-right 
stairs. Move on until you see a door. Beat the guard and open the door. 
Inside, you’ll see 4 chests with Mid-Tonic x2, Ether x2.  Return all the way 
to the execution room. On the way, you’ll have to fight Omnicrone. Just deal 
exactly 218 HP damage to him and he’ll escape. When you reach the intersection 
near the execution room, head north. Move on until you reach the second 4-
stair room. Head to the lower-left stair first and get the chest with a 
shelter in the right room. Head back to the 4-stair room and beat the Blue 
Shields again. Head to the upper left stair and exit through the hole in the 
second room. You’ll now be at the walls of the castle. You can now reach the 
chest in which its room cannot be opened for a shelter. There will be another 
hole in the ground. Get in and get the chests below for a Lode Sword and 
1500G. You can return up by examining the wall where you climbed down. After 
getting the chests, return to the second 4-stair room. Head to the upper right 
exit now. Move on until you see a save point and the Manual which gives info 
about your next boss. Read it then SAVE.

Continuation (Trial)...
After saving and using a Shelter if necessary, head up the stairs you see. On 
the way, the ground will shake. Move on and meet the Boss:

Boss:  DRAGON TANK
#############################################################################
Dragon Tank HP: 300 
Head HP:        700 
Grinder HP:     700 
EXP: 40
G :  500
Charmed Item: Not possible

Destroy the head first as it has the ability to restore HP to all parts of the 
Tank. Destroying will ease the battle. Kill the grinder then the body. You 
cannot use Lucca’s Fire Techs as it will be use if the head is still there. 
You can use Crono’s Cyclone to damage every part of the Tank making it a bit 
easier to beat.
#############################################################################

After destroying the tank, the bridge will collapse. Don’t worry, the 
chancellor will lend you a hand. Move on. Get the chest along the way, it 
contains shelter. When you see 2 guards, walk past them then head to the 
entrance of the castle. The guards will stop you, but eventually Marle will 
reason out to her father and joins you in leaving the castle.

GUARDIA FOREST (1000 AD)
------------------------

After entering the forest, the guards will quickly catch up with you. They got 
you cornered and there’s no way out except to the right. Run to the right and 
you’ll see a gate. Just before you get captured again, examine the gate and 
you'll be able to escape.

BANGOR DOME (2300 AD)
---------------------

You’ll arrive at an unfamiliar place, which is advanced in Technology. Your 
party will notice that you’re now in the future. There’s nothing to do here so 
leave the Dome and exit to the World Map. And head south and enter Trann Dome. 
Take into consideration that if you stay too long on the world map, your 
characters’ HP will slowly deteriorate until it becomes 1. So, if you think 
you already spent too much time on the World Map, go inside into any of the 
domes then come back out to prevent HP loss. 

TRANN DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------

You can buy items and equipments here. You can also use the Enertron, which 
will recover your HP and MP completely. Use it as you please. After doing 
these, there’s nothing else left to do so leave the Dome.

LAB 16 (2300 AD)
----------------
Item/s:
   Berserker
   Lode Sword
   Lode Bow
   Ether

Head north in the world map past Bangor Dome and enter Lab 16. There are a few 
items here. Just beware of the rats, they will steal Tonics from you if it 
touches Crono while running/walking. You can get a Berserker when you go all 
the way to the left after entering the Lab entrance near Bangor Dome. On the 
way, you’ll see a chest containing another Lode Sword. Now, move on. Again, 
you’ll see another chest that is in the way of a running rat. Time it right 
that you reach the chest right after the rat runs the opposite way. You’ll get 
a Lode Bow for Marle. Move on and you’ll meet a group of shadows. After you 
beat the 3 Shadows, ignore the big plant-like creature and head south to get 
the chest for an ether. Now, move on and head northeast. You’ll have to fight 
the Mutant that you’ll see here. After beating it, exit to the World Map.

ARRIS DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------
Item/s:
   2 Mid-Ethers

Head to the Arris dome and enter. You’ll see a small group of people inside. 
Their leader is the Old Man Doan. After talking to the people, save and buy 
from the kid if necessary. You may also use the Enertron to save shelters. 
Now, speak to Doan and he’ll tell you that they cannot get the food from below 
because of the robots. Head to the ladder you see which is in the middle of 
the room. Upon entering, you’ll see 2 consoles wherein the one to the right is 
shining. Ignore it for now and climb up the ladder to the left. There’s a very 
simple maze here. You have to cross the steel planks to get to the other side. 
When you see a rat, ignore it for now. Here’s the direction where you should 
go through the planks to reach the top if ever you didn’t get it. First 
intersection, right. second Intersection, up. Third intersection, right then 
fourth intersection, up. On the fifth, turn left. Sixth Intersection, left. 
Seventh intersection, head up. Eighth intersection, head right then finally, 
head north. You’ll reach a room with an alarm. Continue walking/running north 
and another boss will stop you:

Boss:  GUARDIAN and 2 BITS
#############################################################################
Guardian HP: 1300
Bit HP:      200 each
EXP:   300
*TP:   -
G:     1000
Charmed Item: Not possible

Try to kill the 2 bits first as they will launch massive attacks like the 
Amplifire attack. When you beat the 2 bits, the Guardian will start a 
countdown. When it reaches 0, the 2 bits will re revived. He’s not easy at the 
same time not hard. In short, average difficulty. You can beat them by 
physical attacks and Single or Dual Techs.

New Strategy: from (Stephen - stephen4188@yahoo.com)

To prevent the Amplifire Attack, destroy one of the 2 bits. Doing this, they 
cannot perform the Amplifire Attack. The guardian cannot Revive the single Bit 
until both of them are destroyed. So, destroy one bit and concentrate your 
attacks at Guardian. 
#############################################################################

After beating the Guardian, head north. Your party will see a deceased man. 
After regaining control of your characters, examine the man again and you will 
now know that the rat, which was at the Steel Planks, is not a statue. Get the 
chest for a Mid-Ether. Head back to the Planks. You’ll see the rat. Now, try 
to run as fast as you can and catch it. When you think it’s near enough, hit 
the A button to catch it. He will tell you that, to gain access to the door 
way back in the entrance (the place with 2 consoles), stand in front of the 
shining console, hold the L and R buttons then press A. Remember that YOU MUST 
talk to the rat first in order to move on. You won’t be able to use the code 
at the console if you didn’t talk to the rat in the first place.

Now, go back there and do it. When the new path comes up, you can now enter 
the right door. Upon entering, don’t go up to neither of the ladders instead, 
head north past the monsters to reach a chest with a Mid-Ether. Now head back 
and walk down the stairs to the left. At the end, walk down the stairs. Move 
on until you see another set of stairs. Walk up the stairs and head north to a 
door. In here, you can actually take any path you like whether take the stairs 
or take the right route. When you reach the first Proto 2 (the robot, not the 
spider looking ones), head left and walk up the stairs. Move on until you 
enter a room with a monitor and a console. Lucca will operate it and you’ll 
see the location of the other gate. You will also be shown the Day of Lavos 
1999. When the characters talk to each other, select “Okay!”. Once outside the 
monitor room, you’ll see another console to your right. To reach it, head to 
the place where you saw the first Proto 2 then go north ignoring the ladder. 
Upon reaching it, use the LR + A button code you used to enter this place. It 
will make a path to the sealed door but you can’t do anything as of now but 
when you come back here later, you won’t have to do it anymore. Now, head back 
to where Doan was. He’ll be amazed that you survived below. You will give him 
the seeds you found from the deceased man and he will give you a Bike key you 
can use later at Lab 32. Use the Enertron, save or buy items if necessary, 
then head out to the World Map.

SEWER ACCESS (2300 AD)
----------------------
Item/s:
   600G
   Rage Band
   Bolt Sword

If you want to make it easier when you come back here later I suggest you head 
left to the Sewer Access. You have to activate the bridge here so that you can 
have easy access later. Inside, a guard will pass by. After regaining control, 
head right, defeat the enemies and get the chest for 600G. Then, head all the 
way to the left until you see a scene with two frogs talking to each other. 
Follow them down the ladder. Below, head right. You will see a cat. If you 
examine it, you’ll have to fight 3 Nereids. Move on. You’ll then see a can and 
a trash bin. If you examine either of them, you’ll fight 4 Nereids. Next, 
you’ll see a slice of cheese. If you examine it, you’ll have to fight 2 
Nereids and a rat. Move on. Next, you’ll see a save spot. If you examine it, 
you’ll fight 3 Nereids. Finally, climb up the stairs. Above, you’ll see a gap 
between a bridge and another bridge to your left. Ignore the bridges and head 
north. You’ll see a slight opening in between the wall. Go through here to 
reach a switch, which will open the opposite door. Head back then up. Continue 
pressing the Up Key until Crono Stops. You’ll now be able to head right. When 
you see that Crono stops, head down through that door. You’ll see another 
scene with the 2 frogs. Anyway, just head right then up to get a Rage Band 
from the chest. Now head right to meet:

Mini-Boss:  KRAWLIE
#############################################################################
HP:    550
EXP:   100
*TP:   - 
G:     500
Item:  Mid-Ether
Charmed Item: Mid Ether

He is so easy. You can beat him with your eyes closed while pressing the A 
button continuously.

* - I haven’t seen it... yet.
#############################################################################

After beating Krawlie, move on until you see a ladder. Go past it fast and get 
the chest for a Bolt Sword. Then, press the switch to fill the gap and the 
bridge will now be accessible. Now, don’t go back to climb the ladder. 
Instead, cross the bridge you just activated and you’ll notice that you’ve 
been here already. Now head all the way back to the ladder which you used to 
enter this area and exit to the World Map. Note: The ladder at the end will 
send you to the World Map but it is on a remote island. You can find the 
Keeper’s Dome and the Death Peak there. But you don’t have to go there yet.

LAB 32 (2300 AD)
----------------
Item:
   Race Log

Now, head north to Lab 32. In the lab, head north and examine the Jet Bike 
(you will automatically use Doan’s Bike key on it). 4 Proto 2s will attack 
you. fortunately, Johnny will come and stop the robots from attacking. 
Instead, he’ll challenge you to a race through Lab 32. you must beat him in 
order to reach the end of Lab 32. Here’s a tip. You can just sit back and 
watch until you are close enough to the finish line and push that B Button for 
a speed boost. You only have 3 boosts and you must use it only if you are in 
front of Johnny. He will always try to stay in front of you so watch out. 
Again, if you win, you’ll be at the end of Lab 32. but if you lose, don’t 
worry. You can always challenge him to the race or you can ignore him and just 
walk/run through Lab 32. I recommend walking because you’ll gain experience in 
the process and an item along the way. You can get the race Log item that will 
record the scores you get every time you race Johnny. At the start of the race 
your score will start from 0 and will increase during the race. But, if you 
managed to stay in front and not allow Johnny to even get beside you, when he 
bumps your back you’ll receive points. But if Johnny is in your front and you 
bump into him, you’ll lose points. Anyway, once you reach the end in any 
manner you like, exit to the World Map.

PROTO DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------

In the World Map, don’t go to the factory yet. Head to Proto Dome first. 
Inside just move on and use the Enertron if you like. When you see a Robot, 
Lucca will repair it. Then, you can name R66-Y as Robo (any name will do, 
we’ll just use Robo for the sake of the walkthrough). Then, you’ll tell him 
that you need to get to the gate to be transported back to 1000 AD. He will 
agree to help you in turn for fixing him. Choose from Marle or Lucca who will 
stay behind. As for me, I left Lucca the first time I played because Marle has 
Curative Magic. Once Robo joins your party, leave Proto Dome and head to the 
Factory up north.

FACTORY (2300 AD)
-----------------
Item/s:
   2 Shelters    Robin Bow
   Titan Vest    Plasma Gun
   Hammer Arm    2 Ethers
   400 G         Mid Ether
   Bolt Sword

Inside, examine the console that you’ll see there and Robo will deactivate the 
laser in front of the conveyor belts so that you can continue on. Kill the 
acid that shows up. Use the conveyor belt and use the right elevator first.

In here, there are 2 ladders to the south. Go to the ones on the left and get 
the Robin Bow at the end. After getting the Robin Bow, go back up the ladder 
and then use the other ladder to the right. Here, move on until you see a door 
and the conveyor belt. Now, walk to ON the conveyor belt and go to the left. 
Try to evade the Proto 3s here because if they were able to you, you’ll be 
taken to another conveyor belt. Now, continue walking to left on the conveyor 
belt. Get the chest for an Ether on the way. After getting the ether, continue 
going left and enter the door to the south at the end. In the next area, just 
move on and enter the door. Next, go to the top of the screen for a Mid-Tonic. 
And then, go left a bit and enter the door to the north. Here, get the 2 
chests for 400 G and Mid-Ether. Now, examine the computer and it’ll tell you 
about the crane controls. Leave this room. Go left from the door and enter 
another new room to the left. 

Inside, get the 2 chests for a shelter and an Ether. Now, exit through the 
lower left door. You’ll be able to control the crane. You have to push 2 
buttons in order to command the crane. First, press B and then A and the crane 
will remove the barrel. Second, press X and then A and the crane will remove 
another Barrel. Now, go back to the previous room. Then, use the ladder to the 
left of the door you just came through. You can pass now as the barrels are 
gone. At the end, enter the room and get the Bolt Sword from the chest. Then, 
examine the computer and it will translate the password “ZABIE” into “XABY” 
meaning, you have to press X A B Y (you’ll see what I mean later). Now, leave 
this room and go all the way to the right (don’t go up the ladders on the way 
just use the ones at the end). After getting the items and knowing the clue to 
the password, leave this area and head back to the first room here in the 
Factory, then use the left elevator.

Below, there is a save point. You can also head north to a chest containing a 
shelter. After beating the Acid and Alkalines, examine the computer to open 
the hatch right below the chest and reveal a ladder. Head down. Move on until 
you see a laser. Enter the door that you see. You can pass through the wall on 
the left to reach the chest containing another Titan Vest. Then, head right 
for another chest containing a more powerful arm for Robo, the Hammer Arm. 
Now, examine the computer beside the 4 lasers. It will deactivate all lasers 
in the factory. But you have to survive the fight against acids and alkalines. 
Now head to the elevator to the right of this area. If you select up, you’ll 
be brought to the floor with the save point you saw earlier. Save if you want 
to then head to the lowest floor. Here, ignore the ladder to your left. It 
will lead you back to the computer room where you turned off the lasers. So 
follow the hallway north. There is a locked door. There is also a chest 
containing a Plasma Gun for Lucca. To open the door you have to press a 
sequence of buttons. The clue is “Zabie”. If you pronounce it, you’ll see that 
it is equivalent to the buttons “XABY”. So punch X,A,B,Y. The door will open. 
Head north then push the switch. The emergency system will activate. You’re so 
lucky that you weren’t trapped in. After regaining control of your characters, 
use the ladder as the elevators are shut down. On the way, you will encounter 
Robo’s past friends. These robots will beat up Robo pretty badly. Now you have 
to fight all 6 of them. Together, they are a single boss.

It’s not that hard. Just use Crono’s Cyclone to damage more Robots in one 
turn. If you have Marle, have her attack but let her heal the both of them if 
their HP runs low. If you have Lucca, use her flame attacks and if your HPs 
are low, let her use Tonics or Mid Tonics.

* - Because my party members have complete Single Techs, the amount of TP 
gained is not shown. I’ll include this in the next update.
#############################################################################

After you beat them, whoever is in your party will get Robo and you will 
automatically go to Proto Dome. You’ll actually see you party members carry 
Robo to Proto Dome. 

PROTO DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------

Lucca will repair Robo once more then Robo will officially join your party. 
The door is now open and your party will now use the Gate.

END OF TIME
-----------

You will arrive in an eerie and dark place. Move on through the door and 
you’ll meet up with the an Old Man. He’ll tell you that you are at the end of 
time. And that happened because you are in a group of 4. Only a group of 3 can 
use the gate at a time. He’ll also tell you that the pillars of light you saw 
a while ago connects to different times. After regaining control of your 
characters, you may restore you HP/MP if you examine the shining dot near the 
save point. Don’t try to use the other shining dot as this one leads directly 
to the last boss of the game, LAVOS (if you examined the bucket and defeated 
Lavos, you’ll get Ending #4). I’m absolutely, perfectly, undoubtedly sure that 
you are not prepared to fight him (unless you’re in the New Game+ mode or you 
played for DAYS leveling up your characters to 40+). Let’s move on. Head back 
to the pillars of light. On the way, the Old Man will call your attention. 
Talk to him and he’ll tell you to take a peek on the next room. Inside, you’ll 
find Spekkio the Master of War. His form will depend entirely upon your 
levels, more to that later. Talk to him and if he asks you a question, answer 
“Strong!”. He’ll the tell you more about Magic. That it was used years before 
Crono’s time. He’ll teach you how to use Magic if you WALK around the room 
clockwise 3 times. WALK, don’t hold the run button. After walking around 3 
times, talk to him again and he’ll give you the power of magic. 
Crono/Lightning, Lucca/Fire, Marle/Ice, Robo can’t use Magic but Spekkio will 
tell him that his laser attacks have a little Shadow Magic. Then he’ll ask you 
if you want to try it out. If you win, you’ll receive items. 

Here are the items you can get by beating him:

Level 1 - 19     Special Refresher: 1 Magic Tab, 5 Ethers
Level 20 - 29    Choice: 1 Magic Tab, 5 Mid Ethers
Level 30 - 39    Healthy Choice: 1 Magic Tab, 5 Full Ethers
Level 40 - 98    Graceful: 1 Magic Tab, 1 Speed Tab, and 1 Power Tab 
Level 99         Cheerful: 10 Magic Tabs, 10 Speed Tabs, 10 Power Tabs,
                 and 10 MegaElixirs
(Thanks to Brandon Boucher: TheDOORS66@aol.com for the info)

If you didn’t win, don’t worry, your HP/MP will be restored. After fighting 
him, return to the Old Man and talk to him. He’ll tell you that you have to go 
to your own time first to be able to change what you want. So go to the light 
pillars and go to Pillar #6 to Medina Village 1000AD. Here’s the sketch of the 
Pillars:

  #1    #2    #3

  #4    #5    #6
  
  #7    #8    #9

Locations and Time:
1 - Bangor Dome (2300 AD)
2 - Tyran Fortress (65,000,000 BC)
3 - Truce Canyon (600 AD)
4 - Mystic Mountains (65,000,000 BC)
5 - Proto Dome (2300 AD)
6 - Medina Village (1000 AD)
7 - Leene’s Square (1000 AD)
8 - Earth Bound Island (12,000 BC)
9 - Guardia Forest (1000 AD)

If you use the bucket, the Old Man mentioned, you’ll fight Lavos. The final 
boss. If you did, you’ll get ending #4. If you don’t want to fight yet, or if 
this is just your first game, don’t examine it.

MEDINA VILLAGE (RESIDENCE  1000 AD)
-----------------------------------

You’ll be transported to a residence of a Mystic in Medina village. When you 
try to exit, the Mystic will tell you that there is a man who lives west of 
their place. So head out to the World Map. Before leaving, you can examine the 
cake here. The mystic will offer it to you. If you accept, it will replenish 
the HP and MP of your Team Members. 

MEDINA SQUARE (1000 AD)
-----------------------

Go to Medina Square in the middle of the village. Here you’ll learn fact about 
what happened years ago in the war of the Mystics vs. humans. Just came here 
to learn, that’s all. The game won’t be exciting without the story right? Go 
back to World Map again.

EDLER’S HOUSE -MEDINA VILLAGE(1000 AD)
--------------------------------------
Item/s:
   Speed Tab
   Magic Tab

Go to the Elder’s House. First, get the shining speed Tab in the kitchen. Now, 
go to the second floor of the house to get a shining Magic Tab on the desk. 
Then, head back out to the World Map. If you want to sleep at Medina Inn, you 
have to fight the Hench and the Diablos first. Pay 200 G afterwards.

MARKET -MEDINA VILLAGE(1000 AD)
-------------------------------

When you enter the Market, the Mystics will attack you then they will allow 
you to buy from them. But look at that Price, it’s unbelievable. I’ve got 
outrageous prices. All the Equipments are at Maximum, 65,000G EACH. The Tonic 
is at 2,440G, Revive at 48,800G! I guess this is random, or the battle might 
have an effect. If you’re so strong that you can beat the two with one slash 
each (i.e. New Game+), the higher the price will be. If you’re quite weak and 
took a few hits, the price will be lower. I’ve seen also some of the prices. 
The Tonic is at 470G, 1100G. I suggest that you don’t buy anything because you 
can’t afford it. Just head back out to the World Map.

FOREST RUINS (1000 AD)
----------------------
Item:
   Mid Ether

Go to the Forest ruins, which is like a triangle to the north. Just get the 
chest with a Mid Ether then head back out to the world map.

MELCHIOR’S HUT (1000 AD)
------------------------

Go all the way to the east to Melchior’s Hut. You’ll notice that he is the 
weapons merchant at Leene’s Square when you started the game, if you don’t 
know him. You can buy weapons from him at reasonable prices. After buying 
weapons, if necessary, go north to Heckran Cave.

HECKRAN CAVE (1000 AD)
----------------------
Item/s:
   2 Ethers
   Magic Scarf
   Mid Ether

Upon entering, 2 Henches will attack you. After beating them, move on until 
you see a ladder. Climb down the ladder and get the Ether inside the chest. 
Continue heading down then move on. On the way, a Jinn Bottle and 3 
Octoblushes’ll attack you. After beating them, move on. 2 Tempurites will 
attack you on the way. If you observe carefully, you’ll notice that most of 
them are unsusceptible to physical attacks so use Magic instead. When the path 
splits in to 2, head to the south. Fight 3 RolyPolys and get the chest but 
just before you do that, 3 Cave Bats’ll attack you. Get that Magic scarf after 
beating them. Return back to the intersection and take the upper path. Take 
another chest that contains a Mid Ether. Move north until you reach another 
chest that contains an Ether. Now head south. Defeat the 4 Tempurites and head 
south to the next area. Now fight against 4 more Rolypolys. Now head left and 
fight those Cave Bats. Now enter the passageway you see. Fight another batch 
of enemies with a Jinn Bottle and 3 Octoblushes. Move on. You’ll see a black 
chest here but you can’t do anything to it now so enter the passageway to the 
north. When you reach the waterway, head right. You’ll eventually reach a 
ladder. Climb up and use that save point. Prepare yourself to battle against:

Boss:  HECKRAN
#############################################################################
HP:   2200
EXP:  250
TP:   10 
G:    1500
Charmed Item: not possible

He’s a little hard. Physical attacks won’t do well so stick to your magic. 
When he tells you to attack him, don’t. Just stall for a moment until he stops 
that attacking pose. If you attack him during his pose, he will counter attack 
with Water Wave, which you don’t want to happen. You can beat him on your 
first try though. Just keep on healing.
#############################################################################

After beating him, Lucca suggests that you use the Gate at Leene Square. So 
head north until you see a small pool of water. Jump in. You will be 
transported near Lucca’s House through a giant whirlpool. Go to Lucca’s House.

LUCCA’S HOUSE (1000 AD)
-----------------------
Item:
   Taban Vest

Go to the second floor of the house using the right stairs. Talk to Lucca’s 
Mom. Wait until Taban comes in and gives his earnings to Lucca’s Mom. After he 
leaves, return to the Living room and talk to Taban. He will give Lucca a 
special armor he made himself. The Taban Vest. Return to the World Map.

MARKET (TRUCE VILLAGE 1000 AD)
------------------------------
Item:
   10 Mid Ethers

If you saved Fritz back at Guardia Castle during the execution of Crono, if 
you talk to him here, he’ll give you 10 Mid Ethers for your help. After 
buying, if necessary, return to the world map.

LEENE’S SQUARE (1000 AD)
------------------------

Go to Leene’s Square and use the Gate where Lucca’s invention is. You’ll end 
up at the End of time. Note that you will always pass through here whenever 
you use ANY of the gates.

END OF TIME
-----------

Here, you can restore your HP/MP, Save and change party members. You will also 
notice that pillars #3 and #7 are now accessible. Use pillar #3 to Truce 
Canyon 600 AD.

When you arrive at Truce Canyon. GO BACK to the End of Time and beat Lavos now 
and achieve ending #5. Do this only if you are at Levels 40 and above or if 
you’re in the New Game+ mode. If not, move on.

ZENAN BRIDGE (600 AD)
---------------------
Item:
   Shelter

Leave Truce Canyon. In the World Map, you’ll notice that Zenan Bridge is now 
complete. But there seems to be a problem so enter Zenan Bridge. Here, talk to 
the Knight Captain and he’ll ask you if the rations from the castle are on the 
way. So, go to Guardia Castle. Remember to take that free Shelter on Guardia 
Forest.

GUARDIA CASTLE (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Ether
   Jerky
   Power Tab
   Shelter

Upon entering, head to the right at once and down the stairs to the Kitchen. 
Find the chef who is running all around. Talk to him then take the somewhat 
camouflaged chest beside the pot for an ether. Now head back to the entrance. 
On the way, the chef will call you and will give you the Jerky so that you can 
give it to the army fighting at Zenan Bridge. You’ll also be given a power 
tab! Now head back out to the world map and head to Zenan Bridge. Again, get 
that shelter from the monster in the forest. This will be the last time I 
shall remind of this. You can stock up on as many shelters as you want, just 
keep on leaving and coming right back in the forest.

ZENAN BRIDGE (600 AD)
---------------------
Item:
   Gold Helm

Once there, give the Jerky to the Knight Captain. Suddenly, one of the 
soldiers will come and tell the Captain that Magus’ troops are breaking 
through. After regaining your characters, talk to the Captain and tell him 
that you agree to help them. He will give you a Gold Helm after agreeing. Now 
head left to the bridge and prepare for battle. Here, you’ll be introduced to 
Ozzie, Magus’ general. He’ll summon 2 deceased and you’ll have to fight them. 
To make the battle short, attack Ozzie instead. He’ll loose his control over 
the deceased and will run away. After that, head left for another fight, now 
with 3 Deceased. Beat them, and prepare yourself for a boss.

Boss:  ZOMBOR
#############################################################################
Upper Body HP:  1300
Lower Body HP:  1000
EXP:   350
TP:    10
G:     1500
Charmed Item: not possible

He’s not that hard. I simply attacked the upper part of his body. But beware! 
After you beat the upper body, he’ll use MP Buster that will steal ALL MPs 
from one of your party members. For the lower body, it can tolerate physical 
attacks better than the upper body. So, use Crono’s Lightning Magic or Lucca’s 
Fire Magic to deal a good amount of damage. After you beat both of the parts, 
you win! Duh!
#############################################################################

After beating Zombor, continue moving left and you’ll exit to the world map in 
the Village of San Dorino. You can but items from the Market also if you need 
them. Go to the Elder’s House.

ELDER’S HOUSE -SAN DORINO(600 AD)
---------------------------------

After you enter, you’ll eavesdrop on the chief and a man named Toma talking 
about a “Rainbow Shell” which can create reflective armors that are very  
strong against magic.  Now, return to the World Map and head to the residence.

RESIDENCE -SAN DORINO(600 AD)
-----------------------------
Item:
   Magic Tab

Talk to the people here if you like. You’ll find a shining dot in the drawer 
but it is locked. Talk to the Old Man that you see and he’ll trade your Naga-
Ette Bromide for a Magic Tab (Thanks to Lorne Dixon for the Info), it’s on the 
drawer with the shining dot. Exit to the World Map for now.

FIONA’S VILLA (600 AD)
----------------------
Item/s:
   2 Mid Ether

Go to Fiona’s Village in the middle of the desert. Talk to her then take the 2 
chests for 2 Mid-Ethers. Return to the World Map again.

CURSED WOODS (600 AD)
---------------------
Item/s:
   Shelter
   Mid Tonic
   Magic Scarf

Now go south a bit then head left through the trees and enter the Cursed 
Woods. In Cursed woods, you can find a Mid-Tonic, a Shelter inside 2 chests. 
Now, head all the way to the north and move behind the bush where a frog came 
out. Enter it, it is a ladder. Below, you’ll see Frog. Talk to him a couple of 
times until he says “The hero I am not, I can do naught”. Now go to the pot on 
the upper right portion of Frog’s place. Examine it go get another Magic 
Scarf. Head back out to the World Map.

MARKET -PORRE(600 AD)
---------------------
Item:
   Power Tab

You can go to the Market that is right beside the Inn. You can buy an armor 
and a helmet here. You can also find a shining Power Tab to the left. Get it 
then head back out to the World Map.

PORRE VILLAGE (600 AD)
----------------------

You can also head to the different houses to learn more info about Tata, the 
supposed Legendary Hero with the Medal. After learning that he moved north, 
return to the World Map and head north to Denadoro Mountains. Note, don’t go 
to the Magic Cave yet because you don’t have the Masamune. We’ll go there 
later.

DENADORO MOUNTAINS (600 AD)
---------------------------
Item/s:
   Ether          600G
   2 Revives      2 Mid Tonics
   500G           Silver Stud
   4 Mid Ethers   Silver Erng
   300G           Magic Tab
   Shelter        Broken Masamune
   Hero Medal     MirageHand

Bring Lucca with you. You’ll need her fire magic in this place. Upon reaching 
a ladder, you’ll see a kid who is being chased by a Goblin. After beating the 
goblin an Ogan will come and attack you. With the hammer, his defense rises 
both physically and magically, but if you use any of Lucca’s Fire Magic, the 
hammer will burn and you now have a helpless little goblin. Now, don’t go up 
the ladder yet. To right and go up the stream onto the next area. Here, you’ll 
see a sleeping Ogan on the top. You’ll be able to get a chest here that 
contains Robo’s MirageHand. After getting the weapon, go back to where you saw 
the Kid.

Climb the ladder. In this area, there’s a sleeping goblin. Don’t come near 
him. Instead, move up slowly until the Goblin is lined up with Crono so you 
can get the chest to the left. Here’s the diagram if you need it:

    Chest ----------- Crono ----------- Sleeping Goblin
                        |
                        |
                      ladder

After aligning the three, push the left button on the Direction-pad to reach 
the chest on the left for an ether. Now, head to the top of the ladder and do 
not go down. Walk left then head south until you reach the area where you saw 
the kid. You’ll now be able to get that chest on the ledge for a Revive. Now 
head north again. Fight the goblin if you like. If you examine the Goblin he 
will continue to sleep, but when go continue north, a free lancer with throw a 
stone to the goblin to wake him up. You have to fight them now. After beating 
them, head north and cross the wooden bridge you see. Then, climb up the next 
ladder you see. Defeat the 2 Goblins and take the chest for 500G. Cross the 
wooden bridge to your right. Now, walk down SLOWLY and when you see a goblin 
running, time it right that it doesn’t catch you. Head up the ladder and 
continue to the next area. When the path splits into two, take the upper path 
first and take the chest for a Mid-Ether. Return to the intersection and head 
right. Take the chest you see for a Revive. Now, head up the ladder. Get 
another chest for a Gold Helm. Head up the ladder and continue heading left. 
When the path splits into 2, head to the lower path first, climb down the 
ladder and get the chest for a Mid-Tonic. Head all the way up the left to 
enter the area with a big waterfall. Climb up the two ladders here onto the 
next area. Don’t forget to get that Mid-Ether on the way. Btw, the free lancer 
that throws stones at you will give you an accessory. Take a look at the 
accessories section. In this new area, head up another ladder and get the 
chest for 600G. Now prepare you characters for 4 continuous fight. It means 
that, right after you beat a batch of enemies, you’ll have to fight the next 
batch right away. First batch, Ogan and Goblin. Second Batch, Ogan and Free 
Lancer. Third batch, Ogan and Goblin again. Fourth Batch, Ogan and 2 Free 
Lancers. After that fight, head left to the next area. Here, get the chest 
right away for 300G. Head north. After beating the Free Lancers and the 
Bellbird, get the chest you see for a Mid-Tonic.

Now if you want, you can get a few extra, but VERY HELPFUL items. In the 
river, if you head south, you’ll see a large waterfall. If the waterfall 
washes you away, you’ll end up in a new area with one chest. But, there is 
another way to get an extra chest. So follow, my instructions carefully. 
First, go to the center of the river. WALK down slowly, little by little and 
head to the waterfall. When the huge waterfall starts to pull you in, push the 
left button on the Directional-pad and run until a small waterfall pulls you 
in. Let this small waterfall pull you in and Jump in the waterfall. You’ll 
reach a chest with the Silver Stud w/c will cut the MP usage of any Magic/Tech 
of the character it is equipped with. Example, if Crono can use Luminaire, the 
Ultimate magic, he uses 20 MPs which is 20% of the MAX MP he can have. But if 
you equip him with the Silver Stud, he will use only 10 MP or 10% of the MAX 
MP he can have w/c is 99. If you you’re thinking that there’s a Gold Stud, 
you’re correct, it can be obtained later in the game. It cuts MP use by 75%. 
Now, back to the Walkthrough.

After getting the Silver Stud, head towards the cliff and jump off the ledge. 
You’ll land on another area and you can get a chest for a SilverErng. It will 
increase your Maximum HP by 25%. Example:

If Crono has 500 HPs, if you equip him with the SilverErng, his Maximum HP 
will be raised by 25%, w/c is 125. So, his Maximum HP will become 625.

After getting these accessories, head north through the woods and you’ll be 
brought to another area. Then, in this area head north right away. You’ll be 
back to the place where you fought 4 times in a row. Fortunately, you don’t 
have to fight them again. When you reach the river where you jumped off the 
waterfall, head north and all the way to the left, and get the chest past the 
ladder for a Mid-Ether. Climb down the ladder and head to the next Area. Here, 
cross the wooden bridge and you’ll see a monster that looks like Spekkio. Talk 
to him 4 times and he’ll give you a Magic Tab. Move on to the next area. Here, 
you’ll finally find a Save Point. Save and Restore HP/MP then head down the 
ladder on the left. Get another chest for a Mid-Ether then continue heading 
down. Head down another set of ladders and go right to another area. Here, 
you’ll see a short ladder. Climb down and they will jump once you reach the 
end of the ladder. Get the chest you see for a Shelter. After beating the 
enemies, head north through a cave-like opening. Head north towards the sword 
and the kid will stop you. If he asks you if you want the Masamune, tell him 
yes. He’ll call his brother Masa. Then, Masa and Mune will test you and will 
engage your party.

They are easy. Just keep on attacking them using physical attacks and Techs 
that do physical damage. If one of them goes down, so is the other. After you 
beat them you’ll have to fight:

Just concentrate on attacking one of them. It will save your characters HP as 
well as it will save you time. You don’t have to attack the other one at all.

He is pretty tough. You MUST have a healer in your party. Use items with one 
of your characters or if you have Marle, make her the healer. Use your 2 other 
members to attack and use dual techs if possible.

Strategy by: Lorne Dixon (lornedixon@hotmail.com)

To make the fight a bit easier, when Masa and Mune starts to store its power, 
use Crono’s Slash Tech to dissipate the energy so that they can’t use their 
most powerful attack. 

#############################################################################

After you proved your worth to the 2, you can now retrieve the broken 
Masamune. You now have to find who will fix it then. After retrieving it, Masa 
and Mune will transport you to the Base of the Mountain. I’m just so glad I 
will not have to go through the entire mountain again. You’ll be transported 
to the World Map. If you think carefully, you’ll remember that Melchior, the 
Swordsmith in Medina Village 1000 AD, is good a sword craftsmanship. But 
first, go to Tata’s House in Porre. Talk to Tata, the kid you saw in Denadoro 
Mts., and he’ll tell you that he only got it from FROG who dropped the Medal. 
Everybody called him hero so he kept it. After talking to him, he’ll give it 
to you. Now return the Medal to the rightful owner, Frog.

Right before giving it back to frog. You can go back to the End of Time and 
beat Lavos using the bucket, to get ending #6.

CURSED WOODS (600 AD)
---------------------

Go to Cursed woods and talk to Frog. He’ll recognize the Medal. After telling 
you that he has no right to wield the Masamune, he’ll move and you shall 
notice the pot is now glittering. Examine it and you’ll see the other half of 
the Masamune Blade. You will then discover that the word “roichlem” is 
written. It’s Melchior! :) Now leave the cursed woods and go to Truce Canyon 
and teleport to the End of Time.

END OF TIME
-----------

Now, do what you should always do here. Restore HP/MP, change party members if 
necessary and save. After that, use pillar #6 to Medina Village 1000 AD. When 
you reach 1000 AD, head to Melchior’s Hut.

MELCHIOR’S HUT (1000 AD)
------------------------

Talk to Melchior. He’ll be surprised that you have the Masamune Blade. He will 
then tell you to get Dream stones, which are not around anymore for a long 
time. Did you guess it? Yup. You have to go to the prehistoric era to get it. 
So go to the Residence and use the gate. Do the thing you normally do at the 
End of time then finally, use pillar #4 to Mystic Mountains 65,000,000 BC.

MYSTIC MOUNTAIN (65,000,000 BC)
-------------------------------
Item/s:
   Berserker
   Third Eye
 
Right after you are teleported, you’ll fall right away. There will be reptites 
roaming around and they will attack your party. The technique in beating these 
reptites is for you to use Lightning Attacks. After beating these Reptites, 
more will come your way. But then, a cave-woman will come and beat some of the 
reptites. All leftovers are for you to deal with. After beating them, the 
woman will return and introduce herself. Her name is Ayla. After some talking, 
she tells you to follow her to her village, Ioka. Quickly, follow Ayla. On the 
way, you’ll see a green chest. Take the first one for a Berserker. When you 
have returned to the World Map, head east to see the village. You’ll see 4 
huts. Enter the Lower Right Hut first. You can talk to the woman here if you 
want to drink some sweet water that will replenish your HP and MP. Next, you 
can visit the Upper right hut and trade your G and your items (specifically 
the petals, fangs, horns, and feather) here are the items you can trade for 
and the quantity you need. Remember that you must have Ayla join your party 
first.

Item/Equipment   Requirements
Ruby Gun         = 3 Petals and 3 Fangs
Sage Bow         = 3 Petals and 3 Horns
Stone Arm        = 3 Petals and 3 Feathers
Flint Edge       = 3 Fangs and 3 Horns
Ruby Vest        = 3 Fangs and 3 Feathers
Rock Helm        = 3 Horns and 3 Feathers

Note: If you are in need of these items, head to the hunting Range North of 
Ioka Village. If it rains, quickly roam around the Hunting Range and find that 
Nu (Blue Monster) it’ll give you a good quantity of all items. All enemies 
here have items here are the items that you can get from a certain monster:

Group of Amphibite, Croaker, Rain Frog = 2 Feathers, 2 Fangs and 2 Horns
Group of Ion and Anion = 2 Petals and 2 Feathers
Nu = 3 of every trading item (as a bonus, he’ll give you a Third Eye)

Let’s Continue. One of the people in this hut will sell you a Tonic, Mid-
tonic, and Heal. Now, head to the chief’s hut. Talk to Ayla and the scene will 
automatically be brought to the Jurassic Party! You can talk to anyone here. 
To continue the story. Speak to your party members, including Ayla, until Ayla 
offers you the Jurassic Soup. When you regain control of Crono, talk to your 
party members and drink the soup. Talk to your party members again until Ayla 
brings up the topic regarding the Red rock. She will then challenge you to a 
soup race. Gulp as many soup as many you can by tapping the A button as fast 
as you can. If you lose to her, start again until you win. After you win 
you’ll a good night sleep. But when you wake up, you’ll notice that your Gate 
Key is missing. The footprints on the ground suggest that Reptites are the 
crooks. Your party will then agree to meet Ayla. In Ayla’s hut, wake her up. 
She’ll join you in your search of the Gate Key. When you leave, you can now 
trade your petals, etc. for equipments. The items and their requirements are 
written above. You can go to the lower right hut and the man in the middle 
will give you a Tonic. Now, go to the lower left hut and talk to everyone here 
to know where to go next. Now, head south of the village and enter the Forest 
Maze.

FOREST MAZE (65,000,000 BC)
---------------------------
Item/s:
   3 Mid Tonics
   2 Revives
   2 Mid Ethers
   Shelter
   Heal

After entering the Forest Maze, you’ll see Kino. He’ll tell you that he took 
the Gate Key because he is jealous. Then, he’ll also tell you that the 
Reptites took it away from him. So, to get to the Reptites Lair, follow the 
footsteps and go through any path available to get extra items. If you somehow 
weren’t able to cross to another part, use a vine as a ladder if you see one 
or use the fallen trees as bridges. Just follow the footsteps and you’ll never 
be lost. On the way, you’ll find chests that contain, Mid-Tonic x3, Revive x2, 
Mid-Ether x2, Shelter, Heal. After following the footsteps, you’ll exit to the 
world map near the Reptite Lair. Enter the Lair.

REPTITE LAIR (65,000,000 BC)
----------------------------
Item/s:
   2 Mid Ethers    Elixir
   Ruby Vest
   2 Full Tonics
   Rock Helm
   Full Ether

Inside, head through the cave to the right to the next area. In this area, 
you’ll see evilweevils roaming around and digging holes. If you want treasure, 
wait until all Evilweevils, the blue shark-like monsters, have finished 
digging. For your information, once an Evilweevil digs, he’ll disappear from 
the area mainly because it fell down the hole. Now, after waiting for them to 
finish. There will be 5 holes in the ground. Don’t worry about it because 
these are at random. The holes lead to different rooms/route below, but the 
ultimate goal here is to arrive in a big room filled with reptites running 
crazy around. There are 4 routes to take. Example, if you take route 1, you’ll 
be passing through a set of rooms unique to route 1. It means that, the hole 
in route 1 leads to a different path from the holes in route 2, 3, and 4 and 
vice-versa. In short, you can take any route you like to reach the big room. 
Each route has different treasures in it. Here’s something interesting, you 
can actually get ALL of the treasures and pass through ALL routes. It means 
that you can pass through route 1 and after you reached the big room, you can 
actually go back to the room where the evilweevils are digging and take 
another route.  I’ll explain how later. Here’s the graph of the routes you can 
pass through. So, if you want to use route #2, jump in the hole created by the 
EvilWeevils, which is to the North Easternmost. If you want to use route 3, 
jump in the hole that is on the South Westernmost. I you don’t know which 
route is which, I have a graph of the rooms of the routes after you jump in 
from the first holes. Note that if the EvilWeevils didn’t dig the holes 
properly, i.e. they dug holes wherein the holes they created can’t give you 
access to the route you want to take. If this happens, head out to the world 
map and re-enter the Lair.

 ------------- -------------
|             |             |
|   Route 1   |   Route 2   |
|             |             |
 ------------- -------------
|             |             |
|   Route 3   |   Route 4   |
|             |             |
 ------------- -------------

Here are the different info about each route, refer to this mini-guide about 
the enemies and treasures you can get:

Route 1:

In the first room, you’ll have to fight 2 EvilWeevils in order to jump down 
the hole. Take note that you always have to defeat the enemies first before 
jumping down the holes. In the next room, you’ll face a Megasaur. To weaken 
it, use Crono’s Lightning magic. Then attack it continuously until it dies. 
Head down the hole. You’ve now reached the big room! Skip routes 2, 3, and 4 
and Go to The Big Room.

Route 2:

Note: if you wait for the evilweevils, one of them will dig at the bottom 
right corner of the screen. This will lead you to a room with an Elixir.

In this room, you’ll have to fight 2 EvilWeevils and 2 Fly Traps. After 
beating them, get the chest for a Mid-Ether then jump down the hole. Here, 
you’ll have to fight a Flytrap and 2 EvilWeevils. Get the chest for a Ruby 
Vest. Head down the hole to reach the big room! Skip routes 3 and 4 and go to 
the Big Room.

Route 3:

In the first room, fight an Evilweevil and a flytrap. Get the chest for a Mid-
Ether afterwards. Jump down the hole. In here, another pair of EvilWeevil and 
a Fly Trap. Get the chest for a Full Tonic and jump down the hole. Voila! The 
Big room! Skip route 4 and go to the Big Room.

Route 4:

I the first room, you’ll fight an EvilWeevil and a Fly Trap. Then, get the 
chest for a Full Tonic. Jump down the hole.  You may be familiar to this room. 
It is the same as the second room in route #2. The enemies here are 2 
EvilWeevils and a Fly Trap, and the chest contains the Ruby Vest. Jump down 
the hole to the Big Room!

The Big Room:

Here in the Big room, you’ll see those running Reptites, defeat them for EXP. 
Then, there are 2 Reptites guarding 2 chests. The lower chest contains a Rock 
Helm and the upper ones contain a Full Ether. After getting the treasures, 
leave through the northeast exit. Here, you’ll have to fight the Winged Ape 
and a Shitake. After beating them, head north. You’ll have to fight another 
batch of monsters. After beating them, you can take the left cave-like opening 
and it will bring you back to where the Evilweevils dug holes. You can 
therefore, take another one of the routes. You can always use any route as 
many times as you like to gain exp or G. But remember that, on the way, you’ll 
meet up with a winged ape and you must beat him in order to jump the hole to 
reach the EvilWeevil room.

If you want to go to the exit of the Reptite lair, move straight ahead and 
don’t enter the cave that will bring you back to the evilweevil room. You’ll 
encounter a Megasaur and 2 Reptites. After beating them, a save point will 
show up to the right. Save and use a shelter if necessary then head up the 
stairs to the north. You’ll meet Azala, the leader of the Reptites. You can 
answer him with any choice when he asks you. Then, he will call..

Boss:  NIZBEL
#############################################################################
HP:  4000
Exp: 500
TP:  10
G:   0
Charmed Item: Third Eye

He is hard. First, you have to shock him with Crono’s Lightning Magic. Then, 
pummel him with Ayla’s Techs and Crono’s Attacks/Techs. Have the other 
character heal. After a while, he will release his electrocution to your party 
doing big damage. Heal right away and repeat all the steps and you’ll beat him 
eventually.
#############################################################################

After beating Nizbel, Azala will give you back your Gate Key. After receiving 
the key, you will automatically be taken back to Ayla’s Hut. After saying 
goodbye, return to the Mystic Mountains.

MYSTIC MOUNTAINS (65,000,000 BC)
--------------------------------

In the mountains, all you have to do is to go all the way up until you see the 
Gate in the middle. So, stand to the edge of the cliff, right over the gate, 
and jump down. You’ll automatically be brought again to the End of Time. Do 
what you usually do here and use pillar #6 to Medina Village 1000 AD. Then go 
to Melchior’s Hut.

You can also beat Lavos right away using the bucket. You’ll get ending #7 if 
you beat him.

MELCHIOR’S HUT (1000 AD)
------------------------

Melchior will be shocked to see you holding the Masamune and a Dream stone. 
After giving these to him, he will make the sword. Lucca will also help 
Melchior. After the Masamune is done, it will be given to you. Then, head back 
to the residence and use the Gate. At the End of time, use pillar #3 to truce 
Canyon 600 AD. When you arrive at Truce Canyon, exit to the World Map and go 
directly to the Cursed Woods.

CURSED WOODS (600 AD)
---------------------

Here, go to Frog’s place. After giving him the Masamune, there will be some 
Flashbacks about Cyrus. You’ll see what happened to Cyrus way back with Glenn. 
They will also give you a clue about the true identity of Frog. But you 
probably know it right now :) Anyway, the next morning, Frog will wake your 
party up. You’ll then decide to go straight to Magus’ Castle. Now return to 
the world map and head directly to the mountain, east of Fiona’s Villa. Enter 
the Magic Cave.

You can go back to Truce Canyon before going to the Magic Cave and use the 
Time Gate. Beat Lavos using the Bucket and you’ll receive ending #8.

MAGIC CAVE (600 AD)
-------------------

Here, you’ll see another flashback about Cyrus and Frog, err… Glenn. You’ll 
see the actual incident that made Glenn into Frog. After the flashback, Frog 
will use the Masamune to open a path to the Magic Cave. You’ll be 
automatically brought inside the Magic Cave. You’ll see a small bat following 
you. Don’t worry about it.. for now. Here, just move on until you fight 5 
Gremlins. To kill these Gremlins, which are nearly impervious to physical 
attacks, use Level 2 Magic attacks to kill them instantly. Remember also that 
they are absolutely fast. After killing them, a second batch will appear. Now, 
head up the ladder you see. Examine the dead soldier. A note will give clues 
on the ability of the Juggler in Magus’ Castle. Exit north. You’ll now be in a 
different place in the World Map. Use a shelter to prepare you for the battles 
to come. Save, then enter Magus’ Lair.

MAGUS’ LAIR (600 AD)
--------------------
Item/s:
   4 Mid Ethers   2 Mist Robes   Magic Scarf
   2 Shelters     Dark Mail
   Slasher        Doom Finger
   2 Barriers     Speed Belt   
   2 Magic Tabs   Revive

Once inside the actual castle itself, you’ll see 2 paths to take. One to the 
left and one to the right. Take the left one first. Note that you can already 
take the chest here without worrying about the enemies around. So, on the way, 
get the Mid-Ether, then at the end, get another Mid-Ether and a shelter. Don’t 
forget to talk to EVERYONE here. Now, return back to the intersection and take 
the right path. You’ll see 4 kids surrounding the chest. Just like in the 
other path talk to EVERYONE again. You can’t get the chest yet so move on. On 
the way, you’ll get another mid-ether. After talking to everyone, return to 
the intersection. You’ll notice that a Save Point suddenly appeared. Examine 
it and Ozzie will appear. He then informs you about Slash, the swordsman, and 
Flea, the Magician. And he’ll also tell you that you have to beat all 100 
monsters in the castle (you really don’t have to fight all 100 monsters. You 
can just walk/run away from them). The first batch contains of 2 Vamps and 4 
Henches. By the way, these Henches are much more stronger that the Henches you 
fought at the Cathedral. After beating the first batch, you have 2 choices. 
The left path leads to Slash and the right ones will lead to Flea. For this 
walkthrough, let’s head for Slash first so go left.

As Ozzie have told you, you have to defeat ALL 100 monsters so exterminate any 
enemies that you see. The first batch in the left path consists of an 
Omnicrone and 4 Decedents. (monster count = 11) I’m adding this monster count 
so that we can count how many monsters you have terminated so far and will 
also serve as a guide to the completion of 100 monsters. Let’s continue. After 
beating this batch, head north and fight another batch consisting of the same 
monsters as before. (monster count = 16). After beating them, head north. Talk 
to the woman in the middle and it will initiate a fight with 5 Decedents 
(monster count = 21). After beating them, you’ll face:

Boss:  SLASH
#############################################################################
First Part HP:  3000
Second Part HP: 5000
Exp:  500
TP:   10
G:    1500
Item: Slasher
Charmed Item: not possible

He has two parts you have to deal with. His first form is not that hard. Your 
attacks will deal a decent amount of damage whether if it is a physical or a 
magical attack. After dealing about 3000 HP of damage to him, he’ll get his 
sword. This is the second part of the fight. With the sword, his physical 
defense will greatly rise almost making him invulnerable to physical attacks. 
So, use magic! But beware, he has an attack called “Yes Indeed!” which slashes 
one of your party members dealing a huge amount of damage. To beat him, use 
the 2 most powerful magic users in your party and have the other one heal. Be 
patient ;)
#############################################################################

After beating him, get his sword, the Slasher, and use the Save Point that 
appears. Now, head back to the intersection (you don’t have to fight those 
monsters on your way back, they are not counted) and take the right path. If 
you can evade the enemies, go on.

In this path, talk to kids around the chest. Tell them that you want the 
treasure. They will transform into 4 shadows. (monster count = 25). After 
beating them, you can get the chest for a Barrier. Next, you’ll find Taban 
(the person you’ll see here depends who your third character is: if you have 
Marle, you’ll fight the King, if you have Robo, you’ll fight Lucca) and it 
will attack your party. It consists of 2 Henches (purple), 2 Vamps and a 
sorcerer. The sorcerer drains any magical attack you use so stick to physical 
attacks. (monster count = 30). Head north and you’ll meet Leene. It will turn 
into a batch of monsters again which consists of the same monsters as the 
previous one. (monster count = 35). Head north again and meet Crono’s Mom. 
Talk to her and she’ll turn into another batch of monsters that consists of 
the same monsters as the previous batch. (monster count = 40). After beating 
the monsters, continue north. In here, you’ll meet up with Flea? Hmm.. 
something fishy going on around here.

Boss:  FLEA?
#############################################################################
HP, EXP, TP, G:  0

This flea is almost pathetic, in the sense that, he is so weak. But when you 
defeat it, it will cast MP buster on the one who killed it therefore reducing 
that party member’s MP to 0. Now meat the real Flea! The one flying around you 
all the time.
#############################################################################

Boss:  FLEA
#############################################################################
HP:   3500
EXP:  500
TP:   10
G:    1000
Charmed Item: not possible

This is the real flea and don’t under estimate him, I mean her, whatever. As 
you know he/she is a magician, magic attacks are inefficient, so stick to 
Crono and Frog’s Techs. She’ll also confuse your party members so use the item 
Heal to cure it. Have your other character heal.
#############################################################################

After beating flea, she’ll leave behind a shining Magic Tab. Now, return to 
the intersection and you’ll notice that another save point appeared. Touch it 
and you’ll be transported to another part of the castle. In here, you’ll a 
barrage of enemies. The first batch consists of 2 purple Henches. (Monster 
count = 42). The next batch consists of 2 Purple Henches and 2 Grimalkins. 
(monster count = 46). The Third batch consists of 2 Purple Henches and 2 
Sorcerers. (monster count = 50). The fourth batch consists of 2 Purple 
Henches, 2 Grimalkins and 2 Sorcerers. (monster count = 56). Then, you’ll see 
Ozzie. Get the chest first for a Mist Robe. Then, talk to Ozzie. He’ll call 
Slash and flea but realized that you already dumped them. He’ll then escape. 
Follow him. In this room, you’ll see falling blades. Time it so that you run 
or walk past them right after they are lifted from the ground. After passing 
through 2 blades, get the chest for a Dark Mail. Move on. When you reach 
Ozzie, he will escape again. Get the chest for a Doom finger. Now head north. 
You’ll see a couple of monsters here. Beat them all. The first batch of 
enemies consists of 3 vamps, a Roly, and a juggler. The next one, with a Roly 
and a Juggler. (monster count = 63). In the next room, you’ll see Ozzie but 
beware! The ground here has so many holes. When you fall on one of them, 
you’ll reach a large room. You’ll have to fight all 6 of the decedents here. 
There are also chests here that contain a Barrier, Shelter, Mid-Ether, and a 
Lapis. There is also a Magic Tab in the Lower Right corner of the room. Now, 
for the Save Points. 2 of these save points will actually attack you! I think 
it’s the only game that you are able to fight Save Points. They only have 10 
HP so it’s a piece of cake. The other one of the Save point will be a real 
one. And the last one will transport you back to the room with holes. If you 
fall down for the second time onwards, you don’t have to fight the decedents 
anymore. But the Save Points will be randomly arranged so it’s up to your luck 
to find out which is the real save point and the Teleporter. Be reminded that 
right in front of Ozzie is one of the holes. After you reach Ozzie, he’ll run 
away again. Head north. In this area, you’ll fight roly Bombers, Outlaws and 
the Jugglers. If you attack the Jugglers, its Physical defense will be 
activated, you should then use magic. After that, its magical defense will be 
activated and you can use physical attacks and vice versa. There are 7 
monsters here. (monster count = 70). Head north. You’ll be fighting 2 batches 
of monsters here. The first batch consists of 2 Groupies and 2 Outlaws. Next, 
2 Outlaws and 2 Jugglers. Finally, 4 Jugglers. (monster count = 82). Ozzie 
will escape again, but get the chest first for a Speed Belt. Follow Ozzie. In 
here, you’ll fight another barrage of monsters. The first batch has 2 Outlaws. 
The second one has a Juggler and 2 Outlaws. The next one has a Juggler, 2 
Outlaws and 2 Flunkys. (monster count = 92). Move on and get the chest for a 
Revive. In the next screen, you’ll see Ozzie. Take the chests first for a Mist 
Robe and a Magic Scarf to be sure. During your fight with him, his protection 
cannot be pierced so attack the chains one by one and he’ll eventually fall to 
his doom. After that 2 save points will appear. The one to the right is a real 
save point, and the one to the left will transport you to Magus’ Place. On the 
stairs, you’ll fight 6 Vamps. Beat them and go through the door below. 
(monster count=98!). Where did the 2 go? They are Slash and Flea! Making it 
100 all in all! Ozzie was right! Anyway, Magus’ room will be dark. Just move 
forward and the blue flames will light up and you’ll reach Magus at the end.

Boss:  MAGUS
#############################################################################
HP:   6500
EXP:  1500
TP:   15
G:    3000
Charmed Item: not possible

Magus is really hard. Every time you attack him, his Magic Barrier will 
change. Example, you have Crono, Frog and Lucca in your party and his barrier 
is Lightning. All you have to do is to use any Lightning Magic and it will 
deal a good amount of damage to Magus. His barrier will then change. Just use 
the element of his barrier against him. If he uses a barrier wherein you’re 
party members doesn’t have, just use physical attack to force him to change 
his barrier. After you’ve dealt a certain amount of damage, he will start 
risking to cast a spell. It’s now time to KILL him with any attack you wish. 
You’ll beat him in a short while.

Special Note by David Condamines (david81@moncourrier.com):
When you attack Magus with the Masamune of Frog, his defense power will 
decrease!
#############################################################################

After beating Magus, a large Gate will appear. After getting sucked by it, 
you’ll end up in Crono’s House with Marle. You’ll see a Dream of Crono inside 
his house with Marle as his wife. This happened maybe because of Crono’s true 
feeling about Marle, and that is love. But, Crono and the party was actually 
sent to the Mystic Mountains and was rescued by Ayla and taken to Ayla’s Hut 
in 65,000,000 BC. The next morning, Kino will come in. Then suddenly, one of 
the villagers will come and tell Kino that the North Woods is burning. So head 
out to the World Map. 

From here you can go to the Time Gate at Mystic Mountains and fight Lavos 
using the Bucket at the End of Time. You’ll get ending #9 for doing this. If 
not, move on.

Save and Restore your HP/MP if necessary and head north to Laruba Ruins. It is 
the ruins surrounded by trees and is directly west of the Hunting Range. 
You’ll see Ayla and an Elder there. Ayla asked permission to use the Dactyls 
so head out to the world map again after regaining control of your characters 
and head further north to the Dactyl’s Nest. But before you go there, visit 
the Ioka Trading Hut if you have enough trading items. They have new 
equipments now.

   Meso Mail

Inside, just continue heading north until you see a ladder made of wood. Get 
the chest you see for a Mid-Ether. Move on and on the way you’ll find another 
chest containing a Mid-tonic. Continue and climb another set of wooden ladder 
and turn right to the next screen. In here, move along and climb all wooden 
ladders. Get the chest on the way for a Meso Mail. When you reach the top of 
Dactyl’s Nest, you’ll see Ayla. Go talk to her. You’ll voluntarily help her at 
Tyrano Lair then after that, she’ll call in 2 more Dactyl’s for you. Select 
the character you wish to join you and Ayla. You’ll now be able to fly in the 
world Map using the Dactyl’s. The controls are simple. Push Right, Left, Down, 
Up on the Direction-pad and you will move Right, Left, Down, Up respectively. 
To land, just push the A button on a clear surface. You’ll can’t land on trees 
and mountains, the same goes for bodies of water too. To ride it, just walk 
towards it then push the A button. Let’s continue. Land first and restore your 
HP/MP and then save. To get to the Tyrano Lair, go to Ioka village and head 
directly to the east. You’ll see a structure on top of a small mountain. Land 
on the clearing on top of the mountain and enter the Tyrano Lair.

TYRANO LAIR (65,000,000 BC)
---------------------------
Item/s:
   Mid Ether    2 Full Ethers
   Full Tonic   Cerra Topper
   Tonic
   Revive
   Meso Mail

Inside, move forward and you’ll see 2 skulls. The one to the right is open so 
go there first. Head down the ladder to the next screen. In here, beat the 
Purple reptites then push the switch to the right of the door to free Ayla’s 
Villagers. Head to the right and go down the ladder. Beat the reptites and 
you’ll see Kino inside the Cell. The switch is not working so talk to Kino. 
Ayla will desperately try to break the door and fails. She will actually open 
it later. When you regain control of your characters, return first to Kino’s 
Cell and talk the Egg, which contains a Mid-Ether. Now, follow Kino. He will 
open the previously closed Skull in the room where you first came in. Go 
through the newly opened skull and climb up the ladder. In here, you’ll see 2 
switches. When you step on them, the monsters will drop in the holes. There 
are 2 doors here. The left door is slightly to the lower left of the left 
switch and the right door is slightly to the lower right of the right switch. 
Take the door on the right. Move on until you come to a room with 2 eggs. 
Inspect the left one first and you’ll receive a Full tonic. The, inspect the 
right one and you’ll fall to the room. Beat the enemies then head outside, 
you’ll notice that you’re inside the cell where the Villagers you saved where. 
Head to the left and back up to the room with 2 skulls and go through the left 
skull again. Above, push the switches again to trap the enemies that are here. 
Now, head to the lower left door. You’ll arrive in a dark room. There are a 
couple of treasure eggs here to get. First, head north and you’ll see 2 eggs. 
Get the one to the left first for a Tonic. Now head south and you’ll see 
another 2 eggs. Get the one at the lower right to get the Cerra Topper. Now, 
you can get the upper left one this way, it’s the best way I can guide you to 
get it. You can see that the ground has squares in it right? Now, head all the 
way to the north until you see the 2 eggs again. Stand in the square just 
below the egg where you got the Tonic. Push the right button until Crono can’t 
get any further. Move 7 squares to the south then walk/run to the right. 
You’ll be teleported a bit south of the egg. Get the egg for a Revive. Now for 
the upper right most egg. Stand to the square just below the Egg where you got 
the Revive. Move south 1 square, then east 3 squares. Now, run/walk to the 
south and you’ll be teleported to the upper rightmost chest for another Meso 
Mail. After getting all the treasures, head to the upper left of the room and 
climb up the steps. In the next screen, head south to the door. Outside, head 
to the right. Go in the open door. Inside, you’ll find 2 switches. The one to 
the left will open the skull but will also summon 2 monsters. The one to the 
right will open the Skull only. After opening the skull, head north and push 
the switch. Head back outside and you can now enter the middle door. Inside 
the middle door, you’ll find Nizbel at the entrance. You won’t have to fight 
him yet. After talking to him, pass through him. You can pass by him through 
his left or right side. I’m sure you’ll get it. Now, save and restore HP/MP is 
necessary. Head north and Nizbel will come up to you and attack.

Boss:  NIZBEL II
#############################################################################
HP:   6500
EXP:  880
TP:   15
G:    0
Charmed Item: Third Eye

When you use lightning attacks, Nizbel’s defenses will decrease. But, if you 
attack him physically, his defenses will rise again. Beware also if he 
releases his electrocution energy. It deals a very big damage to all of your 
characters. One strategy is to have Crono use lightning attacks, then let the 
stronger of the two remaining characters attack physically. It would probably 
be Ayla. Now, have the third one heal you party. Just continue alternating 
between Crono and your attacker. You’ll kill him efficiently that way. 
Important Note. Don’t attack him physically continuously. His defenses will 
rise and rise if you do that.

Strategy by: ~DeadDays (DeadDays@aol.com)

To deliver a BIG amount of damage to Nizbel, use Crono and Ayla’s Volt Bite. 
It is the best attack to use against him.
#############################################################################

After beating Nizbel, you may want to go back to the Save Point and refresh 
your characters, then save. Move on until you reach the wall of the Tyrano 
Lair. The door in the middle will be closed for now, so go to the far right 
and enter the door. You’ll see 3 switches here. Push the upper switch that 
will make a save point appear. Use it if necessary. Next, push the lower left 
switch to activate the holes. Then, press the lower right on to see monsters 
fall to their deaths. Then, head to the skull and examine its mouth to open 
it. Go through it and get the chest for a Full Ether. Push the switch and the 
middle door back at the outer wall will open. Inside the middle door, you’ll 
see Azala himself. He will go through the door to the north. Prepare your 
character for a very challenging battle. But first, get the 2 chests on both 
sides of Azala’s throne for a Full-Ether and another Cerra Topper. Head north 
and you’ll see Azala with his pet, the Black Tyrano.

Boss:  AZALA and BLACK TYRANO
#############################################################################
Azala HP:  2600
Tyrano HP: 11000
EXP:  1800
TP:   25
G:    0
Charmed Item: Magic Tab (Azala) 

Here is a battle that you may actually never forget. First beat Azala by using 
physical attacks and Lightning Magic. He has a strong defense so it will take 
time to beat. When Azala dies, he’ll cast Azala Break, which will take down 
your HP. Now, you’ll have to concentrate on the monsters. Physical attacks 
will be useless. Wait until he lower his defense and use your characters most 
powerful Techs. If the countdown reaches 0, he’ll attack and regain his 
defense. You’ll have to wait again. Always heal your party members right after 
any attack by Azala or Black Tyrano. You may not beat the duo in your first 
try. But try again and you’ll succeed eventually.
#############################################################################

After beating them, some scenes will be shown. You’ll see how Lavos arrived on 
earth at 65,000,000 BC. When you regain control of your characters, head back 
to the village and buy any items you may need and restore all your HP/MP then 
finally, save. Head back to the Lair Ruins.

LAIR RUINS (65,000,000 BC)
--------------------------

When you enter the ruins, your party will see that there is a Gate. They will 
conclude that Lavos’ immense energy disrupts time, therefore, creates gates. 
Use the Gate and you’ll be transported to..

CAVE (12,000 BC)
----------------

Leave the Cave and return to the world map. You’ll see snow and you’ll also 
notice that you are in 12,000 BC where Magic is a part of life to everyone. 

Here, you can go back and use the Time Gate again to go to the End of Time. 
Beat Lavos using the bucket and you’ll achieve Ending #10.

In the World Map, head to the east until you reach the Skyway.
To use it, just step on the circle inside. You’ll be transported to a Land 
Bridge on a floating Island. Go to the structure you see on the right, which 
is Enhasa.

ENHASA (12,000 BC)
------------------

In here, you can talk to people to gain information about the Kingdom of Zeal. 
There is a shop in the lower left part of Enhasa. If you head to the upper 
left, a boy with a cat will tell you that one of your party members will 
perish. If you think well, you’ll know who will it be. I won’t spoil it for 
you. You’ll also see a Spring of Recovery here that will replenish your HP/MP. 
Head back out to the world map and use the Northern Land Bridge. You’ll be 
teleported to another Skyway. After reaching the skyway, head out to the world 
map and head north. Enter the skyway you will find here. You’ll arrive in 
another part of the Kingdom of Zeal. Go to Kajar.

KAJAR (12,000 BC)
-----------------

Talk to all the people here. You can buy items from the Nu. Now, you’ll notice 
there a shining dot on the upper right of Kajar. To get it, enter the door to 
it’s left. In the next room, examine the southern walls and you’ll get the 
Speed Tab on the other side. Talk to everyone, including the Nu on the north 
part. It will say something like “Water summons wind… wind makes fire dance”. 
After that, head out to the world map and go left to Blackbird.

BLACKBIRD (12,000 BC)
---------------------

In the blackbird, head north and you’ll see 2 guys there. Then, Dalton will 
come in and will tell you something about what the prophet said. After 
regaining control of your characters, head out to the world map and return to 
Kajar.

KAJAR (12,000 BC)
-----------------
Item:
   Black Rock

Now, you can do something here. Remember the clue that the Nu gave you? “water 
summons wind.. wind makes fire dance”. So let’s get the water elemental first. 
Go to the upper left portion of Kajar. Examine one of the books there and the 
Water elemental will show up. Then, head to the lower right portion of Kajar 
where the spring of Recovery is. Examine the book on the table and it will 
summon the wind elemental. Now, head to the Nu who sells items. Check the book 
on the counter and it will summon the fire elemental. You’ll see a door appear 
on your right. Enter it. You’ll see a Poyozo Doll. Examine it and get the 
Black Rock. Read also the book on the upper left of this room. Now, return to 
the world map. Go back to Enhasa first.

ENHASA (12,000 BC)
------------------
Items:
   Magic Tab
   Speed Tab
   Mop

We’ll use the same code as the ones in Kajar. First, examine a book in the 
northeast part, which is the water book. Then, examine the book in the 
northwest part, which is the wind book. Finally, the one near the entrance, 
which is the fire book. After this, a door will be revealed and you can now 
enter there. Inside you’ll find a Nu. If you read the book, it will say “All 
Life begins with Nu and ends with Nu”. Now, talk to the Nu and accept the 
challenge. Then, you’ll have to fight 6 Nus. After that, the Nu will give you 
a Magic and a Speed Tab. You can also Charm one of the Nus for a Mop. Now, 
exit to the world map again. Enter the cave to the right of Kajar and move on 
until you reach the Zeal Palace.

ZEAL PALACE (12,000 BC)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Magic Tab

In here, go first to the Nu walking in the middle. Scratch his back and you’ll 
discover the Nu’s Scratch point. After learning this, go back to Kajar and 
talk to the Nu that is facing the bookshelf on the upper right room. After 
scratching him, he’ll give you a Magic Tab. Now, return to Zeal Palace. 
Inside, head to upper rightmost room and you’ll enter a room with 2 more 
doors. Go through the right one. You’ll see Janus and Schala. After Schala 
leaves, follow her. Return back 2 screens. Then, head left and you’ll see a 
set of stairs that will enable you to go through the middle room. By the way, 
if you pass through the front, 2 creatures just like Masa and Mune’ll block 
you. Now, head to the middle door. You’ll see Schala use her pendant on the 
door. It will open and Schala will go in. Crono tries to use the pendant of 
Marle but it won’t work. Talk to the 2 girls here and they will tell you how 
to make your pendant glow. 

Immediately after this event, after Schala opens the Sealed door for the first 
time, go all the way back to the Time Gate and Go to the End of Time and beat 
Lavos. You’ll get the Humorous Ending #11.

Head back out to the main room and head left and you’ll see a Nu guarding the 
door. Just examine the Nu and it will move away from the door. Enter it. It 
leads to the Mammon Machine. When you reach the Mammon Machine, examine the 
red shining dot in the middle. The pendant will now glow. Head back to the 
middle room and use the pendant on the door Schala went in. When you reach the 
throne room, the prophet will tell the queen that you are the ones he 
prophesized. Dalton will summon a Golem but you can’t beat it if your level is 
low. In New Game+ mode, it’s a piece of cake.

Boss:  GOLEM
#############################################################################
HP:   6000
EXP:  1000
TP:   35
G:    2000
Charmed Item: Magic Tab

He is very hard on your first try. He will copy everything you do. If you wish 
to beat him, use your character’s STRONGEST Techs. You will most like to lose 
on your first game though.

Strategy by: Marc Gugliuzza

Lucca and Crono's dual tech, "Fire Sword" is really great against Golem, it 
makes the fight much easier.

#############################################################################

Either way, if you lose or win, Dalton’ll still capture you. You’ll will be 
kept in the Mammon Machine. Schala and Janus will then save you but the 
prophet will come and threatens to kill you but Schala will come again to your 
rescue. You will then show the prophet how you came here. You will use the 
Gate and Schala will forever shut the gate down. You’ll arrive back at 
65,000,000 BC. When you arrive there, use the Dactyl’s and return back to Ioka 
Village. Save and restore HP/MP is necessary. By the way, the sweet water is 
gone now. One note here. In the Chief’s Hut, you can now use the beds to 
restore your party’s HP and MP. So, rest there now. After doing that, head 
back to Mystic Mts. And use the Gate.

END OF TIME
-----------

Here, talk to the Old Man. He’ll give you a hint about the Wings of Time which 
will enable you to go to any time period you want while flying. Save here and 
use the pillar #5 to Proto Dome 2300 AD.

PROTO DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------

Once you arrive, immediately head out to the World Map. Go back to Arris Dome. 
Don’t forget that you have to pass through Lab 32 again.

ARRIS DOME (2300 AD)
--------------------
Item/s:
   Power Tab    Charm Top   
   Gold Erng    2 Full Ethers
   Hit Ring     Wallet
   Elixir       Magic Tab
   Lumin Robe   Gold Stud

Head to the basement. Head to the Sealed door at the end. You’ll now be able 
to open it with the pendant. Inside, you’ll find a shining Power Tab in the 
middle. Get the chests inside. You’ll find a GoldErng. It will raise your HP 
by 1/2! If your HP is 500, it will become 750. You’ll also get a Hit Ring, 
which will add 10 to your hit rate! Finally, you’ll get an elixir and a Lumin 
Rode, w/ Magic Defense +5, from the 2 chests. After getting these cool items, 
head back out to the World Map. Pass through Lab 16 and head to Bangor Dome. 
Open the Sealed door there. You’ll get a charm top, a Full Ether and a Wallet. 
Then, head to Trann Dome and open the sealed door there for a shining Magic 
Tab, a Gold Stud and a Full ether. After getting these treasures, head all the 
way to the Sewer Access that is just a bit south of Lab 32. Enter it. If you 
visited this place a while ago, you’ll now be able to go to the other ladder 
that leads to another part of the World Map. If you didn’t visit it before, 
here’s how. If you’ve finished it already, skip the sewer access guide and 
head straight for the Keeper’s dome.

(Note: I you haven’t used the console when you first came here, here’s what 
you have to do, there are 2 consoles right, go to the console on the right, 
Press and Hold L and R buttons then press A to examine the console. A path 
will open to the right enabling you to reach the door.)


SEWER ACCESS -GUIDE(2300 AD)
----------------------------

Head left to Sewer access. You have to activate the bridge here so that you 
can have easy access later. Inside, a guard will pass by. After regaining 
control, head left, defeat the enemies and get the chest for 600G. Now, head 
all the way to the left until you see a scene with two frogs talking to each 
other. Follow them down the ladder. Below, head right. You will see a cat. If 
you examine it, you’ll have to fight 3 Nereids. Move on. You’ll then see a can 
and a trash bin. If you examine either of them, you’ll fight 4 Nereids. Next, 
you’ll see a slice of cheese. If you examine it, you’ll have to fight 2 
Nereids and a rat. Move on. Next, you’ll see a save spot. If you examine it, 
you’ll fight 3 Nereids. Finally, climb up the stairs. Above, you’ll see a gap 
between a bridge and another bridge to your left. Ignore the bridges and head 
north. You’ll see a slight opening in between the wall. Go through here to 
reach a switch that will open the opposite door. Head back then up. Continue 
pressing the Up Key until Crono Stops. You’ll now be able to head right. When 
you see that Crono stops, head down through that door. You’ll see another 
scene with the 2 frogs. Anyway, just head right then up to get a Rage Band 
from the chest. Now head right to meet:

Mini-Boss:  KRAWLIE
#############################################################################
HP:    550
EXP:   100
*TP:   - 
G:     500
Item:  Mid-Ether
Charmed Item: Mid Ether

He is so easy. You can beat him with your eyes closed while pressing the A 
button continuously.

* - I haven’t seen them... yet.
#############################################################################

After beating Krawlie, move on until you see a ladder. Go past it fist and get 
the chest for a Bolt Sword. Then, press the switch to fill the gap and the 
bridge will now be accessible. Now, don’t go back to climb the ladder. 
Instead, cross the bridge you just activated and you’ll notice that you’ve 
been here already. Now head all the way back to the ladder which you used to 
enter this area and exit to the World Map. Note: The ladder at the end will 
send you to the World Map but it is on a remote island. You can find the 
Keeper’s Dome and the Death Peak.

KEEPER’S DOME (2300 AD)
-----------------------

Once you enter, you’ll see a Nu. You can talk to it but it will have an error. 
Head to the back part of the Dome and you’ll see a Sealed Door. Enter it. 
You’ll see various shining dots around. It will tell you about Belthasar, the 
Guru of Time and also about Lavos. At the end, enter another Sealed Door. Head 
all the way north and your characters will have a dialogue. Now, try to leave 
the room. A Nu will push some kind of a device into the Wings of Time. It will 
tell you that it is Belthasar’s Memory that is talking to Crono and his party. 
After that, name the “Wings of time”. The default name is Epoch.

***Instructions on using the Epoch***

In the world map, the A button will let Crono Hop Aboard or Climb out of the 
Epoch. The Y button will open the Time Selection screen where you can select 
the time period in which you want to go. In this screen, use the L and R 
buttons to select the time period. Then, press A to select.

After getting the Epoch, head to the Dark Ages, 12000 BC.

You can also use the time Dial to go to 1999 AD right away and beat Lavos. 
You’ll achieve Ending #10 if you do.

DARK AGES (12,000 BC)
---------------------

When you arrive, the Cave to the north has the Sealed Gate. If you try also 
using the Skyway, it won’t work. So head all the way to the upper left and 
enter the Terra Cave.

TERRA CAVE (12,000 BC)
----------------------
Item/s:
   Power Tab

Inside, you’ll see the village of Algetty. The people here don’t have magic so 
they were banished here. When you reach the people, the first cave you’ll see 
will house a person who sells good Equipment. If you have enough G, try to 
upgrade your weapons (or you can just continue on and charm R’bow helms from 
the beasts which is much stronger than the one sold here). After buying 
equipments, if you want, continue heading down. There will be a cave wherein 
you can sleep for free. When you reach the Save Point, Save! Head to the Cave 
opening to the right. In here, get the Power Tab on the lower right. Head 
north. You’ll have to fight 2 beasts. They are just like easy bosses. After 
beating them, head north and beat another pair. At the end you’ll meet the 
real boss.

Boss:  MUD IMP and 2 BEASTS
#############################################################################
Blue Beast HP: 4500
Red Beast HP:  4500
Mud Imp HP:    1000
EXP: 954
TP:  26
G:   2600
Charmed Items: Mermaid Cap (Blue Beast), Elixir (Red Beast), 
               Speed Tab (Mud Imp)

These 3 are hard. The Mud Imp is fast and it will use the 2 beasts and charges 
at one of you characters. Heal your characters often because once BOTH beasts 
attack at the same time, your character’s HP, might drop to 0. To beat it, use 
Fire elemental attacks on the blue beast and Ice/Water Elemental on the Red 
one. You can use any magic on the Mud imp. If you really spent time to gain a 
lot of TPs, if you have Luminaire, just use it at least 3 times to end the 
fight easily. Also remember that, when the Mud Imp is alone, it will gain 150 
HP for every attack you make.
#############################################################################

After beating the boss, climb up the chain to Mt. Woe.

MT. WOE (12,000 BC)
-------------------
Item/s:
   Lode Vest      Shelter
   2 Shields      Time Hat
   3 Barriers     Ruby Knife
   2 Lapis
   2 Full Ethers

In here, you’ll have to fight Bantam Imps on your way. Once you beat it, 
you’ll have to fight the Stone Imp. There are also Rubbles that will use its 
Lock All ability on the first move. It will disable ALL your Techs and Items. 
Now, back to the walkthrough. After beating the first batch of Bantam Imps, 
head north first and cross the chain. Fight the rubble if you want, note that 
it has 1000 EXP and a mid-ether including 100 TP if you can beat it before it 
escapes. After beating the rubble, head south first and get the Lode Helm from 
a chest. Return to the place where you fought the Bantam Imps. Cross the chain 
to the left. Fight another batch of Bantam Imps on the way, then cross the 
chain onto the next section. Here, head right then up. Beat the Gargoyles and 
head up again. You’ll see a Save Point. Restore all your characters’ HP/MP 
then save. Move on. When you see a Chain to the right, go there and get the 
Lode Vest and a Shield Item. Then, head left and collect the treasures. You’ll 
get a Barrier, and a Lapis. Right after you get the Lapis, head right and 
you’ll see another chain which is just above the save point. Cross the chain. 
Move on until you see a chest with a Barrier. Cross the Chain to the right to 
move on to the next section. In here, get the chest fist for another Lapis. 
Head right and beat the 4 Man Eaters. There will be 2 chains here. Head to the 
right chain first and get the chests for a Barrier and a Full Ether. Now, head 
to the other chain and move north. When you see the Rubble, head south and get 
2 chests with a Shield and a Shelter. Head north, then cross that chain. 
You’ll arrive in a save point so, prepare your characters then save. Head up 
the chain to the next section. In here, get the Chest for a Time Hat. After 
getting the time hat, cross the chain and get another chest for a full Ether. 
Restore HP/MP and use the most powerful weapons for your characters. You 
should prepare before climbing the north chain because there is a very tough 
boss ahead. After climbing the chain, examine the crystal. Then, to your 
surprise, here comes..

Boss:  GIGA GAIA
#############################################################################
Giga Gaia HP: 10000
Hands’ HP:    2000
EXP:  3000
TP:   30
G:    3000
Charmed Item: Speed Tab (Head)

He is TOUGH. To beat him, use techs to destroy the ARMS first. These 2 arms 
deal a very big amount of damage to your characters. If your level is low, at 
around 15 below, there is a probability that you’ll get killed with one hit. 
You can also use Level 2 Magic to Damage every part of Giga Gaia. Once the 
arms are gone, give Giga Gaia a beating. Beware, if you can’t finish him off 
fast, he’ll restore both of his arms and you’ll have trouble again removing 
them. On my very first meeting with Giga Gaia, I have to restart around 3-4 
times before I actually beat him.

New and good strategy from Drew Hundley (serval@claws-and-paws.com): 

Have Ayla in your party and have any other character fill-in the third slot. 
Use Ayla and Crono’s Volt Bite to finish of the Left Arm, which is the 
attacking arm. While the third party member, have him/her use his/her most 
powerful Tech on the main body. Just leave the right arm as it is. It will 
recover HPs for the main body from time to time but it is less than how much 
you damage him. If the left arm appears again, kill it again! :) This way, you 
can conserve MP and you can concentrate on attacking the main body if you 
ignore it.
#############################################################################

After beating Giga Gaia, the guru of Life will be freed. It’s Melchior! Then, 
the mountain will crumble and it will collapse. You’ll be automatically be 
brought to Algetty. There will be a scene here with Melchior talking to 
Schala. Dalton comes in and captures Schala. Once you regain control of your 
characters, talk to Melchior. He will give you the Ruby Knife that you must 
use to destroy the Mammon Machine. Now, go back to where you slept for free 
and sleep again to restore the HP/MPs you’ve lost against Giga Gaia. Then, 
head all the way up and exit to the world map. Then, head all the way to Zeal 
Palace using the now accessible Skyways and Land Bridges.

ZEAL PALACE (12,000 BC)
-----------------------

Once you arrive here, go straight to the middle room. The 2 creatures which 
look like Masa and Mune is now gone and you may pass through without having to 
go around again. Head to the Throne room and you’ll fight Dalton.

Boss:  DALTON
#############################################################################
HP:  4000
EXP: 1000
TP:  30
G:   2500
Charmed Item: Power Meal

He is easy. But, be careful. Always use your characters most powerful Tech 
because he will counter you with the Orb attack which brings down your 
characters HP by a half. So, always heal after an Orb Attack. He will escape 
afterwards.
#############################################################################

After beating Dalton, a gate will appear. Use it. You’ll arrive in the Ocean 
Palace.

OCEAN PALACE (12,000 BC)
------------------------
Item/s:
   Aeon Suit     Star Sword
   Rune Blade    Shock Wave
   Aeon Helm     Demon Hit
   Kaiser Arm    Elixir
   Sonic Arrow

In the first section, you’ll see a save point. Use it then, move forward and 
you’ll see Mune. A scene will follow with Schala and the Queen at the Mammon 
Machine. Now, head south to the next section. Here is a big room with 8 doors. 
To the North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest. 
There are also treasures scattered around the area. You’ll get an Aeon Suit 
and a Rune Blade.

I’ll explain the enemies here. There are 3 types of scouts, the Scouter, which 
can be beaten by Lightning Damage, the Blue Scout that can be beaten by 
Water/Ice Magic, and the Red Scout, which can be beaten by Fire. There is also 
this Jinn and Barghest. Barghest is the one that keeps on moving around. Kill 
him first and the defenses of Jinn will deteriorate.

Back to the Walkthrough, in the big room, head to the Northeast door. Step on 
the switch and fight a Jinn and a Barghest. After beating them, exit to the 
lower right door. In here fight another batch of monsters then get the Aeon 
Helm in the chest. Now, there will be 2 doors to the left. Take the one 
heading straight to the left and you’ll arrive again in the Big room. You will 
notice that you have been in the East Door. The next destination is the South 
East door. In there, get the chest you see for a Kaiser Arm. Head left to the 
switch. It will raise a bridge to give you access to the South door back in 
the big room. After switching it on, head left first and get the chest there 
for a Sonic Arrow. Head back to the Big Room. To get the Star Sword, take the 
North West room. Step on the switch and beat the Jinn and the Barghest. Take 
the lower left door. Fight another batch of enemies here then, take the chest 
for a Star Sword. Take the Right door. You’re back in the big Room. Now, head 
to the South West Door. Take the chest here for a Shockwave then head south. 
You’ll be back where you switched on the bridge. Don’t go all the way to the 
south, instead, head left and stay beside the wall and run around until you 
can’t run anymore. You’ll see a chest in a small room. There is a opening 
somewhere in the diagonal wall. Once you get it, you’ll receive a Demon Hit 
from the Chest. Head back to the Big room and enter the South door. In here, 
take the ladder to the left. In this area, just continue moving down the 
ladders and fighting enemies until you reach Masa. He will say something then 
a short scene of Schala and company will follow. Head down the ladder then use 
the Save Point. Head to the south door. Beat the enemies here then examine the 
shining dot. Now for some Elevator Action. You’ll fight 3 batches of enemies 
here one after the other. The first batch is a Jinn and a Barghest and 
Thrashers. The next one has 2 Mages, 2 Lashers and a Scouter. And the last 
batch has 2 Scouters, 2 Blue Scouts and 2 red Scouts. After the elevator 
stops, head to the north door. There are 2 door here. Take the right one 
first. Beat the scouts and press the switch. Do the same thing on the left 
door. Head out and push the switch in the middle to reveal a door beneath the 
flames. Enter that door. In here, get the Elixir from the chest and Use that 
Save Point! After preparing head north to face..

Boss:  GOLEM TWINS
#############################################################################
HP:  6000 each
EXP: 2000
TP:  70
G:   4000
Charmed Items: 2 Magic Tabs (one from each)

They are so hard that I have to restart 5 times before beating it. It will 
copy anything you do to them so make sure you use Techs. Physical attacks are 
almost useless against them. They will use the Ability that they copied to you 
and it will surely be a big damage. Not to mention that BOTH of them can use 
the Iron Orb which reduces your HP to 1|2 . Try and try again if you fail, try 
every way you can.

Easier way to beat GOLEM TWINS by: TheLaser (thelaser@xmission.com)

You may know that the twins will mimic you moves therefore, you can manipulate 
the battle. First off, Include Lucca in your party. Equip everyone with fire 
resisting armors (specifically, Red Mail or Ruby Vest). When the battle 
begins, have Lucca cast Fire 2 on the Golem Twins, they will counter with a 
Fire Attack but you will mostly likely to receive very little damage because 
of your armor. Then, wait for everyone to fill his or her battle gauge, 
including Lucca. Have your 2 other characters use their most powerful attacks 
then finally Lucca, with her Fire 2 again. Just try to be fast enough so as 
the Golem Twins will not use its Iron Orb attack. 

Another strategy by: Roberto Tisu (roberto@comcom.si)

Have Crono, Lucca, and Frog in your party. Use Crono’s Luminaire as the first 
attack then use Lucca’s HypnoWave to put both Golems to Sleep. Then, use Frog 
to heal your characters. Do this until the Golem Twins die.

Another strategy by: Conner (jamescon@att.net)

One of the best teams to use is the team of Crono, Ayla, and Robo. Before you 
do anything, have Ayla and Robo do their Boogie Dual Tech to halt both of them 
(GolemTwins). Then its a simple process of Using Crono and Ayla's Falcon Hit 
attack to whack both of them at the same time. The only damage you will take 
will be the final blow. Then it is smooth sailing from there.

#############################################################################

After beating the Golems, Dalton will try to summon the Golem Boss but has 
more things to do. When you regain control of your characters, head back and 
SAVE. You don’t want to repeat everything do you? Now, continue heading north 
until you see a Nu. Head north and meet the Mammon Machine. Crono will use the 
Ruby Knife, which will turn into a sword. Schala tells you that it won’t do 
any good. Then, all of a sudden, Lavos appears before you. He can’t be beaten 
here on your first play. I’ll try later if you can beat Lavos here after I 
reached around Level 90. After Lavos beats you, the prophet will reveal 
himself as Magus. He can’t do anything to Lavos also. Schala will try but will 
be stopped by her mother. Now, Lavos will try to kill all of you. (If you 
managed to defeat Lavos here, which I think, is the hardest Lavos ever, you’ll 
receive Ending #2) If you lose, after you regain control of Crono, head 
towards Lavos. Crono will be disintegrated. Lavos will then emerge out of the 
ground and destroy the entire Zeal Kingdom. All floating island will fall down 
to the ocean. After these scenes, you’ll wake up inside a house in the last 
village. After talking to the elder, save then head out to the World Map. 
There are 3 huts of the Last Village. Enter the northern most one and you’ll 
see a Nu that sells items. After the Nu leaves you can get the Magic Tab on 
the upper left. Now, head back out to the World Map and go to the Commons. 
Talk to the elder at the end and see Dalton’s soldiers come in. Dalton will 
eventually capture all of you. When you wake up you’ll be in Dalton’s Ship.

BLACK BIRD (12,000 BC)
----------------------

Your party will notice that the equipments and items have been taken away from 
you. So, you’re last resort here is to get Ayla. She is the only character 
that can fight the enemies. If she is not in your party and you got into a 
battle, you will not win without weapons because you can’t attack. Now, head 
up the ladder and your character will be shocked by what they will see. After 
that, head back and one of your party members will tell you that there is a 
breeze in the place he/she is standing. It’s because there is a Ventilation 
hole up there. Now, I’ll tell you how to get back the Items, Equipments and 
money.

First, head south to the door and act sick. The guard will come and will be 
beaten by Ayla. Now, head out the door. Go left into another door and you’ll 
see a chest, which contains all your money. 1 down 4 to go. Leave the room and 
head all the way to the north. You’ll arrive in another section. After beating 
the 2 Bashers, you’ll see 2 doors. Take the left one and you’ll see the chest 
containing all of your items. 2 down 3 to go. Leave the room and head all the 
way to the north and climb the ladder there. You’ll be at the ducts. Head all 
the way to the right and you’ll see a shining Magic Tab. To get it, when you 
can’t run right anymore, head south, when you can’t run south any more, head 
right then up. Now, run back and stop at the first intersection. Head south to 
the next intersection. Here, head left and climb the first ladder you see. 
You’ll arrive where they kept your equipments. Hurray! You got one character’s 
equipment back. 3 down 2 to go. Climb back up and head left. Move on and climb 
down the ladder at the end. Climb another set of stairs down and you’ll arrive 
in a main room. Head right and enter the door guarded by 2 Bashers. In the 
room, you’ll get another chest for the equipments of one of your characters! 4 
down 1 to go. Now, leave the room and climb up the ladder that is just beside 
the door. In the ducts head left and stop in the intersection. Head south to 
another intersection then stop. Head south again to another intersection. Head 
left and climb down the ladder that you’ll see. You’ll arrive in the last 
chest. Hurray! You got everything back! Now, head back up the Air ducts. Head 
right to the intersection. Now head all the way down until you reach the last 
Ventilation hole. Examine it to see Dalton with the Epoch. After the scene 
with Dalton, head up to the intersection. Head north again to another 
intersection. Head north AGAIN to the next intersection. Head right and enter 
the first Ladder you’ll see. You’ll arrive at the first room you’ve seen on 
the blackbird. Use the Save Point. After saving, head back up the Air duct, 
not the ladder. On the air ducts, Head right and move on until you reach an 
intersection. Head north to another intersection then head north once more. 
Head right and enter the first ladder you’ll see. In this room, exit to the 
south door. Then, use either of the 2 conveyor belts to go south. You’ll see 2 
rooms below. Take the left one. Enter the door inside then take the single 
ladder up. You’ll arrive on the wings of the Blackbird. Head to the lower 
leftmost part of the wings and you’ll have to fight the Golem Boss.

Boss:  GOLEM BOSS
#############################################################################
HP:   14000
EXP:  2500
TP:   0
G:    2000
Charmed Item: none

He’s the easiest boss in the game, why? Because he won’t even attack you. All 
you have to do is to attack him physically to save MP and items. Don’t worry 
about counter attacks. He is so scared of Heights to move.
#############################################################################

After beating the golem boss, you’ll see Dalton take off in the now-flying 
Epoch. You’re characters will jump to the Epoch engaging Dalton.

Boss:  DALTON PLUS
#############################################################################
HP:   3000
EXP:  2500
TP:   - 
G:    2000
Charmed Item: Power Meal

He is not that hard. Just use your characters’ most powerful Magic. Use dual 
Techs if they’re available and it will finish him off quickly.
#############################################################################

After beating Dalton, He’ll summon Golem Boss. Since you already beaten that 
Golem, he’ll not be able to summon it. Dalton will fall off the Epoch to meet 
his death. One of your character will then tell you to hit the Y button. Press 
it and it will fire beams towards the Blackbird. The Blackbird will crash. 
Now, your characters will land near the commons. Go there and talk to everyone 
and some of them will tell you about the stranger who passed by who is now at 
the north cape. Before leaving the Commons, make sure you talk to the woman 
here beside the sapling. This will activate Fiona’s Side Quest. If you didn’t 
talk to the woman in the Commons, Fiona’s husband won’t be at home. Head back 
out to the World Map. Head north and circle around the mountain. Head to the 
north westernmost area and enter the Cape.

NORTH CAPE (12,000 BC)
----------------------
Item/s:
   Amulet
   Dark Scythe

Head to the north and examine the shining dot there. You’ll see Magus. He’ll 
tell you more about himself then. After the scenes that show that Magus is 
actually Janus, he’ll ask you if you want to fight him. If you want to fight 
him, you’ll gain EXP, and the Amulet Magus has, including a MegaElixir, which 
you can Charm from him, but you won’t get Magus to join your party. If you 
don’t wish to fight him, when you try to leave, he will come and join you. 
It’s weird, but you can actually rename him. After he joins you, head back out 
to the world map. As Magus suggested, use the Epoch to go to the End of Time. 
But before you do, the Undersea Palace, a.k.a. Black Omen, will emerge out of 
the sea. After the scene, head to the end of time.

From here on, until the revival of Crono, you can achieve ending #12. Remember 
that Crono must still be dead.

END OF TIME
-----------
Item:
   Chrono Trigger

Talk to the Old Man. After speaking to him, try to board the Epoch and he will 
call you. Go back and talk to him again. He will give you the Chrono Trigger 
that may be able to return Crono back. You party will also notice that he is 
actually Gaspar, the Guru of Time. Now, board the Epoch and head to 2300 AD 
and enter the Keeper’s dome.

KEEPER’S DOME (2300 AD)
-----------------------

In here, pass through the Sealed Door. On your way, look out for a shining 
Magic Tab. Now, talk to the Nu at the end. It’ll tell you that “Death Peak” 
has the power to restore life. But, in order to do so, you need an exact 
clone. So, head back to 1000 AD and win a Crono Clone in Leene Square’s 
Norstein Bekkler’s Lab Game.

LEENE’S SQUARE (1000 AD)
------------------------

The Norstein Bekkler’s Lab is found on a Big Tent on the right side of the 
first section of Leene’s Square. If you haven’t played here before, I provided 
the rules (w/c is also written near the beginning of the walkthrough) below:

Norstein Bekkler’s Lab
     Located in the eastern portion of the first section of Leene’s Square.
     It is in a large pink tent with a skull at the entrance. This place is 
     pure fun. First, select the amount of silver points you want to bet.
     10, 40, or 80 Silver Points can be placed as bet.

     At 10 Silver Points, you get to play a game where you must find a 
     certain person among the 3. They are Vicks, Wedge, and Piette. They will
     change places fast. To have an advantage, memorize 2 persons only. 
     Example, watch Vicks and Wedge’s movement. When the clown asks you where
     Vicks or Wedge, you’ll be able to identify the 2. The one whom you
     didn’t follow his movement will be Piette. If you win, you’ll get a 
     Poyozo Doll to use as decoration for Crono’s House. Note that these
     Poyozo Dolls play a major role in the late part of the game. Note that
     the Poyozo Dolls on the second floor of Crono’s House will change the
     music if you examine it.

     At 40 Silver Points, you get to play a mimic game. All you have to do     
     is to Mimic or Copy the movement of the clone using the designated
     buttons, L=Left Arm, R=Right Arm, Y=Laugh, A=Surprise. If you managed
     to mimic everything, you’ll win a Clone of Crono that you can use also   
     to decorate Crono’s House. Take note that this Clone will play a MAJOR
     role in the game. If you think hard you’ll know it. 

     At 80 Silver Points, you get to play a Push the monster game. Your goal
     in this game is to prevent your character, who is hanged just above a
     flame, and push the 3 coins to be able to put monsters into the door at
     the back. It’s very challenging. You’re pushing the coins at the same
     time preventing your character from being fried. If you see a blue light
     Appear at your left side, examine it to raise the rope a bit, then 
     continue pushing those monsters back. If you win, you’ll get a cat.
     These cats will be brought to Crono’s House. You can win as many cats 
     as you want. When you go to Crono’s house, you’ll see all the cats 
     you’ve won roaming around the house.

After you’ve won a Crono clone, it will be delivered to Crono’s House so go 
there. Talk first to Crono’s Mom then get the clone. Head back out and board 
the Epoch. Go back to 2300 AD and enter the Keeper’s Dome once more. Talk 
again to the Nu and it will now use 3 Poyozo dolls to help you climb Death 
Peak. After that, switch off the Nu and head out to the World Map and go to 
Death Peak.

DEATH PEAK (2300 AD)
--------------------
Item/s:
   Magic Ring    Vedic Blade
   Wall Ring     Memory Cap
   Giga Arm
   Brave Sword
   Star Scythe

At the Death Peak, the wind will eventually push you down the Mountain. Now, 
that there are Poyozo Dolls it is easier to go up. First, examine the first 
Poyozo Doll you see and it will turn into a tree. When the wind is strong just 
stay behind it and you won’t fall down. When the wind calms down, RUN up to 
the other tree and stay behind it whatever happens. When the wind calms again, 
RUN up and you’ll reach the next area. In here, walk to the left until you see 
a ladder. Don’t climb up yet. Head left a bit more to find a Magic ring. Head 
up the ladder now. Move to the right until you reach the next section. In this 
area, you’ll notice that the path splits into 2. One to the north and the 
other to the south. Take the south first to reach a Save Point. There is also 
a chest w/ a Wall ring. Now, head back to the intersection and head north. 
Enter the cave-like opening. Inside you’ll find, Lavos Spawn.

Mini-Boss:  LAVOS SPAWN
#############################################################################
HP:  4000
EXP: 747 
TP:  0
G:   500
Item: Elixir
Charmed Item: Elixir

The spawn is not that hard if you will not attack the shell. Whatever you do, 
always attack the head only in any way you want.  
#############################################################################

After beating the Spawn, take the Giga Arm from the Chest. If your HP/MP are 
very low, head back to the save point. Now, Head north past the place where 
you fought the Spawn. You’ll be outside again. Head right and you’ll arrive at 
another part of the cave. Get the chest you see for a Brave Sword. Then, head 
south. You’ll arrive on a cliff wherein below you is the save point you saw 
earlier. Head north and examine the shining dot there. It will open a cave 
below. Head back to that save point and head north and enter the newly opened 
Cave. Inside, climb the series of Ladders and get the StarScythe on the way. 
Enter the cave to the north and you’ll fight another Lavos Spawn. After 
beating the Spawn, head left and you’ll see a Poyozo doll in the next area. It 
will tell you to be careful because if you slip, you’ll return back at the 
start of the Death Peak. If you fall, you’ll be back to the First Save Point. 
Now, if you successfully passed the bridge, you’ll arrive in another section. 
Get the chest you see for a Vedic Blade. Keep on moving and you’ll eventually 
come up to another one of those Poyozo Dolls. It will tell you to push the 
shell, climb the shell. You’ll know what this means later. Head down the 
ladder to the left then move on. You’ll reach the Third Lavos Spawn. After 
beating the spawn, the shell will remain. Now, PUSH the shell to the right 
until you can’t push it anymore. Then, push it north. When you can’t push 
anymore, examine the shell and you’ll climb up. After climbing up, get the 
chest to right for a Memory Cap. Head north afterwards and you’ll reach the 
summit of the Death Peak. The leader of your party will use the Chrono 
Trigger. It will shatter and will bring your party back to the exact time 
where Crono disintegrated. Examine Crono and you’ll exchange the Clone for 
him. After that, Crono will be revived and is brought to the Death Peak for a 
touching scene. You will be brought automatically to the End of Time.

END OF TIME
-----------

In here, talk to Gaspar. He will tell you that you can go and Beat Lavos 
himself now by examining the shining dot in the bucket. You can also visit 
different peoples/event that will empower you to beat Lavos.

1. In the middle ages, a woman’s sheer determination brings a forest back to 
life. 
2. A fugitive in the Middle Ages, Ozzie, maintains an evil hideout
3. There’s a task to be done in the future, where machinery originated
4. And there’s a very special stone that can shine its light on each 
generation, from the distant past to the far future
5. there’s the ghost of a lofty knight, slain by Magus in the Middle Ages, who 
haunts the present
6. There’s an object in the Middle Ages that sparkles like a rainbow
7. One of you is close to someone who needs help, find this person.. fast.

You can do these side quests to get the Ultimate Weapons of your characters. 
You can just bypass them and use the bucket to fight Lavos at once. If you 
want to do the side-quests, skip the Lavos strategy and you’ll see the side-
quests there. Note that you can do these side-quests in any order. And after 
you’ve done the side quests or any other thing, use this strategy when you 
decide to fight Lavos.

If you decide to fight Lavos without completing the Side-quests, here’s the 
Strategy (the ending you’ll see will be ending #1):

Final Boss: LAVOS
#############################################################################
When you fight Lavos for the first time in the game he will copy the abilities 
of previous bosses you’ve met in the game. Also, you’ll be allowed to restore 
your party’s HP/MP after each boss he mimics. 

Here are the bosses he will mimic. Note that everything is copied, including 
the HP, attack, defense, and abilities of the boss.

Dragon Tank  w/ head and grinder
Guardian  w/ 2 bits
Heckran
Zombor -both upper and lower body
Masa and Mune  joined
Nizbel
Magus
Tyrano w/ Azala
Giga Gaia  w/ both hands

After beating his mimic of Giga Gaia, you’ll now have to fight Lavos himself. 
Just use your character’s most powerful Techs. I.e. Crono’s Luminaire, Ayla’s 
Triple Kick, etc. it has 10,000 HPs.

After beating Lavos, its head will disappear and you will enter its shell. 
You’ll see a gate which lead back to the end of time and a save point. If you 
wish to fight Lavos, don’t hesitate to use a shelter. If you don’t want to 
fight him yet, use the gate to return back to the end of time to prepare your 
characters and explore the world!

**Inside Lavos**

Continue moving north and you’ll see the real Lavos. It has 2 hands that will 
deal the worst damage you’ve ever seen so use a Tech that will attack both 
hands at the same time. 

First form:
Right Hand HP: 9000
Left Hand HP:  8000
Body:         20000

To beat him, try to destroy the right hand first as it will restore the HP of 
the body. Then head for the left arm. When the body is the only one left, use 
your party members’ most powerful attacks/techs.  

**True form**

Right Bit:  35000
Left Bit:   2000
Body:       3000

All you have to do here is to use physical attacks/techs on the left bit. 
Then, attack the right bit to lower its defense. Once the defense is lowered, 
use a powerful attack/magic that will damage both Lavos and the bit. Once the 
left bit and Lavos dies, the right bit has the ability to revive them. So, the 
real thing to do here is to beat up the right bit. If you did kill the right 
bit first, both bits will die including Lavos himself and you have finished 
the game!


New Strategy by: Jeffrey Chang
------------------------------
There was just one thing that kept bothering me, because I had to fight
Lavos so many times, with lots of different combinations of characters,
before I gave up, leveled to the mid-fifties, and beat him a few times
in a row to see the different endings.  The right arm of the first Lavos
has an HP of about 12,000, not 9,000, and the body of the second Lavos
has an HP of 10,000.  And the first time I read the section about
beating the second form, I kept trying to lower the right bit's defense
by attacking it right after beating the left bit, but that didn't work
very well, since all the attacks are done by the body.  It works best if
you just do multiple-enemy techs after you kill the left bit, so defense
is continuously lowered while you kill the body.  With an HP of 10,000,
the body takes quite a while to destroy anyway, so you might as well
start off doing damage to both.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“In the middle ages, a woman’s sheer determination brings a forest back to 
life.”

For this side quest, head to Fiona’s Villa in 600 AD.

FIONA’S VILLA (600 AD)
-----------------------

Talk to Fiona then to her husband. They will tell you about the Desert Cave 
that houses hungry monsters. Fiona wants to plant the seedling but with the 
monsters lurking about, she can’t do anything. So, lend a hand and beat those 
monsters in the desert cave, which is like a spiral in the world map a bit 
south of Foina’s Villa.

SUNKEN DESERT (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item/s:
   Lapis          Muscle Ring    HyperEther
   Elixir         Memory Cap
   2 Full Ethers  Full Tonic   
   Aeon Suit      5000G
   Power Tab      Aeon Helm

Upon entering the sunken desert head to the middle and you will fall down to 
the desert cave. Take note that the monsters here are very strong. Get the 
chests in this section for a Lapis, Elixir, Full Ether, and Aeon Suit. There 
is also a shining Power Tab to the right of the upper leftmost chest. In this 
section, you can find a ladder to the south and a cave entrance to the north. 
The cave entrance will lead you to the exit. So, go down the ladder to the 
south. In the next area, the ground will shake. After seeing the skeleton, 
you’re free to move, I suggest getting the items here as they can help you in 
your next fight. But, there’s a condition. The ground here is shaking right? 
Every time the ground shakes your HP goes down so the longer you stay the 
lower the HP of your party gets. So, quickly get the items and face the boss 
at once. So, get the Muscle Ring in the middle, then Memory Cap, Full Ether, 
Full Tonic, 5000G, Aeon Helm and a HyperEther inside the chests scattered 
around. Now, try to guess where the skeleton will appear. It will choose from 
the 4 corners in this area. When you see it rise from the sand, quickly ran up 
to it and fight!

Boss:  RETINITE
#############################################################################
Upper Body HP:  5000
Middle Body HP: 1500
Lower Body HP:  5000
EXP:  2600
TP:   100
G:    2000
Charmed Item: Speed Tab

Use Frog’s water attacks or Marle’s ice attacks on retinite. It will lower his 
defense greatly. Now, use PHYSICAL attacks on the upper body as it is the part 
of retinite’s body that can steal HPs from your characters. After beating the 
upper body, go for the middle part. It has low HP so it can be defeated using 
normal attacks. Now, the Legs. First, you have to cast water magic on it to 
weaken it. Then, use PHYSICAL attacks. Its defense will rise again after your 
attack, so cast water again. Do this until you destroy the legs.
#############################################################################

After you beat retinite, one of your characters will tell you to inform Fiona 
about your success in defeating the monsters in the cave.

FIONA’S VILLA (600 AD)
----------------------

Now, get Robo if you don’t have him in your party. Go talk to Fiona and she 
will tell you that she wishes to live longer to see the seedlings grow. Robo 
will then volunteers to help Fiona. Allow him to help. When you return to the 
World Map, you’ll see Robo plowing the fields. You can’t wait for Robo for 
centuries so board the Epoch and go to 1000 AD.

FIONA’S SHRINE (1000 AD)
------------------------

You’ll now see the House of Fiona turning into a Shrine. Enter it. You’ll see 
nuns inside. One of them sells powerful helmets. I suggest you go buy one if 
you have the money. After buying if necessary, head to the north and you’ll 
see the remains of Robo. Examine it. You will then be taken to an automatic 
camp scene.

CAMP SCENE
----------

In this scene, your characters will talk about Lavos and the Time Gates. After 
the talking, one of your characters will suggest going to sleep. The screen 
will fade. When it shows up again, you’ll gain control of Lucca only. Go to 
the right and you’ll see a Red Gate. You’ll arrive at a very familiar place.

LUCCA’S HOUSE
-------------
Item/s:
   Green Dream
   Taban Suit
   Taban Helm

After arriving at Lucca’s House, you can view the note on the floor. Now, head 
down the ladder. Below, enter the door to the north. You’ll see a note on the 
table. It contains the password for a machine Lucca’s Dad built. The password 
is Taban’s wife, Lara. Now exit this room and enter the other door, which is 
to the south. You’ll encounter a shocking sight. Lucca’s Mom got her skirt 
stuck on the conveyor belt. So, you have to enter the password. Go to the 
shining dot on the machine. Examine it and you will be asked the password. 
Press “A” button again so that the words “Enter Password” disappears (you 
can’t enter the password yet if that message window containing “Enter 
Password” is still open). Press ‘L’, ‘A’, ‘R’, ‘A’ buttons in order and the 
machine will stop. After that rescue scene, enter the red gate once more. 
You’ll meet Robo. Talk to him and you’ll be given an awesome Accessory, the 
Green Dream. It will revive the character to whom it is equipped if he/she 
ever dies. But it can only be used once. It’ll disappear after its first use.

You’ll be automatically taken to the world map. Take a visit to Lucca’s House. 
Talk to Taban and he’ll give the ultimate defense armor and helmet of Lucca. 
The Taban Suit and Taban Helm. That ends the First Side Quest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“A fugitive in the Middle Ages, Ozzie, maintains an evil hideout.”

For this side quest, you have to go to Ozzie’s Fort in 600 AD. To make it 
easier to go there, because it is in a remote island, board the Epoch and go 
to Medina Village of 1000 AD. Fly to Medina Square. The Epoch should be right 
above Medina Square. Then, use the Epoch to head back to 600 AD. When you 
arrive at 600 AD, you’ll be right on top of Ozzie’s Fort. Disembark the Epoch 
and enter the Fort. Be sure to prepare your characters, you’ll know what I 
mean later.

OZZIE’S FORT (600 AD)
---------------------
Item/s:
   Full Ether   Gloom Cape
   Dash Ring    Gloom Helm
   Sight Cap    2 Magic Tabs
   Doom Sickle  

Upon entering, you’ll see Great Ozzie. Note that if you have Magus, there will 
be extra dialogue between them. Magus was their Master after all. Now head 
north, Ozzie will be there again and so is Flea as Flea Plus. You have to 
fight him.. err.. her.. whatever. Use the opposite strategy for Flea. For your 
convenience here it is.

Boss:  FLEA PLUS
#############################################################################
HP:  3500
EXP: 2000
TP:  20
G:   2000
Charmed Item: none

If you remember, when you fought Flea back at Magus’ Castle, you have to use 
physical attacks right? Well, now use your most powerful Magic Attacks. Use 
Crono’s Luminaire, if you have it, 3 times to beat Flea in a short period of 
time.
#############################################################################

After you deal 3500 HP damage Flea will escape. Follow Flea to the north. In 
this room, you’ll see Ozzie. He’ll summon 2 monsters which, unfortunately, too 
bad for him because they fell on the conveyor belts that will bring them to 
their doom. Now, head north. Here, you’ll find Ozzie again and the come 
backing Super Slash.

Boss:  SUPER SLASH
#############################################################################
HP:  2500
EXP: 2000
TP:  20
G:   2000
Charmed Item: none

He’s so easy. Just use any Tech you want. I did a Fire Zone by Crono, Lucca, 
Robo, and he’s dead in one turn.
#############################################################################

After beating Slash, head north. You’ll see a Blade controlled by Ozzie. Don’t 
get the chest yet. Afterwards, an Imp will come in and because of his 
stupidity, he fell for the trap. After Ozzie escapes, you’re free to get the 
Full Ether from the chest. You can also get Magus’ most powerful weapon, armor 
and helm in a secret room here, the Doom Sickle, Gloom Cape and Gloom Helm 
respectively. Here’s the diagram: (try to enter the area where the arrow is)

There is also a Magic Tab where the asterisk (*) is. Thanks to Roberto Tisu 
for the info.

After getting the equipments, check the Magic Tab to the right then exit this 
room and head north once more. Now, you’ll face all three, Ozzie, Slash and 
Flea,  and they are hard to beat.

Boss:  GREAT OZZIE, FLEA PLUS, SUPER SLASH
#############################################################################
HPs
Great Ozzie: 5000
Flea Plus:   3750
Super Slash: 3750
EXP: 7500
TP:  80
G:   4000
Charmed Items: OzziePants (Ozzie), Flea Vest (Flea), Slasher 2 (Slash)

They are hard to beat if they are complete, so beat Slash first because he is 
the one causing the most damage among the three. Also take note that they will 
counter attack with triple techs, namely Bat Impulse and Delta Force and I’m 
sure you don’t want that to happen. So, first, beat Slash using any attack, 
either physical or magical. Then, beat Flea. Then finally, beat Ozzie and 
don’t give him a chance.
#############################################################################

After beating the Trio, get the chests for a Dash Ring and a Sight Cap. Now, 
head north. You’ll meet Ozzie at the end. He will be inside a protective 
barrier and you can never do any damage to it (with the exception of 
cheating). (You can Charm Ozzie once again for another OzziePants). So, attack 
the switch behind him. He will outsmart you by placing a trap below you. If 
you attack the switch you’ll fall down to the place where you fought the trio. 
So, head back to Ozzie. After the fight begins, a cat will come in and throws 
the switch to the trap that is below Ozzie. He will fall down and will never 
be seen again, ever. Now, head back out to the world map. Now, with Ozzie 
defeated, head to 1000 AD right away. When you arrive, go to the Forest Ruins 
again. The place with a blue pyramid.

FOREST RUINS (1000 AD)
----------------------

Inside, head to the top and the pendant will glow. A Nu will appear and will 
give you one of the treasures of the Guru of Reason. The left chest contains a 
Safe Helm and the right chest contains a Swallow, which is a weapon for Crono. 
The Safe Helm is preferable as it will reduce the physical damage to you by 
1/3. The Swallow is a strong weapon for Crono but there are other weapons that 
are stronger so you really do not need the weapon, go for the Helm. (Thanks to 
~The Silent One~ for the info). Now, head back out to the world map.

MEDINA VILLAGE (1000 AD)
------------------------

If you visit the houses in Medina Village, you’ll notice that the Mystics here 
are so peaceful. Because you beat Ozzie back in 600 AD, all the Mystics have 
changed for the good. If you visit the Market here, where you found the shop 
with outrageous prices, everything will have a 20% discount now! Humans and 
Mystics finally live together in peace.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“There’s a task to be done in the future, where machinery originated.”

For this side quest, you have to go to the future, 2300 AD, and visit a new 
place called Geno Dome. To reach Geno dome, here’s a strategy. Go to Porre 
Village in 1000 AD. Now, head all the way to the right until you see a new 
village, which is Choras. Now, travel to 2300 AD. You shall find the Geno Dome 
there. It looks like the Factory when you view it from the world map. Get Robo 
in your party and put him in the lead of your party then enter.

GENO DOME (2300 AD)
-------------------
Item/s:
   2 Full Tonics  MegaElixir     Vigil Hat
   50000G         15000G         Terra Arm
   Speed Tab      2 Full Ethers  Crisis Arm
   Elixir         Power Tab      Magic Tab
   2x Lapis       Hyper Ether

Inside, have Robo examine the panel. The computer will welcome Robo, but not 
in a nice way. The door that leads to the exit will be sealed and there’s no 
turning back now. So, head to the room to the north. In this room, you’ll find 
a large conveyor belt. You’ll fight a sequence of enemies here. First are 2 
Debuggests. Use Crono’s Lightning Magic to make short work of them. The next 
would be 2 Proto 4s. Followed by 4 Debuggests. Followed by 2 debuggests and 2 
Proto 4s. Finally, 4 Debuggests and 2 Proto 4s! Whew, that was tough. Now, 
head north and enter the door. Just above the door, you’ll see a large 
terminal and a switch. Let’s call it Terminal 1 for the sake of the 
walkthrough. If you press the switch the terminal will open. So, press it. 
Robo can enter inside right? Now, you have to charge Robo to active the 
terminal so head left. You’ll see 2 debuggests. Beat them. Then, go up. You’ll 
see a Proto Robot that won’t allow you to go near the chest and the Poyozo 
doll. So, head right and go up once you see a path going north. Don’t go 
through the white door, we’ll go there later. Defeat the 3 Proto 4s you’ll 
find here. Then get the chest for a Full Tonic. Now, examine the computer to 
the right. It will give you information about the Doors and how to open them, 
how to change the direction of the conveyor belt on the right, the robot that 
guards the figurine or the Poyozo Doll and how to get rid of it, and finally 
it will tell you also about the importance of the 2 Poyozo Dolls found in this 
place. To the left of the computer is the terminal where you can charge Robo. 
Let’s call it the Charge Terminal for the sake of the walkthrough. Now, it 
will open after you beat the Proto 4s so, enter it and you will see Robo 
surrounded by sparks. Right after charging, head to Terminal 1 you saw earlier 
and put Robo inside. The door on the left will open up so that you can enter. 
Inside you find a chest with a Full Tonic and another chest for a whopping 
50000G! After getting these, return to the Charge Terminal. Don’t charge Robo, 
instead, head left and enter the white door. You’ll see another terminal here. 
Let’s call it Terminal 2. It is closed right? So head north and beat the 4 
Laser Guards. At the end, you’ll see 3 switches. There is a combination of the 
switches that will open up Terminal two. The code is, from left to right, the 
color of the switch should be Red, then Green, then Red. You will now be able 
to use Terminal 2. Now, head back to the Charge Terminal and charge up Robo. 
After charging Robo up, quickly run to Terminal 2. You’ll be able to enter the 
door to left of the terminal. So, go there and get that Poyozo Doll. There is 
also a Speed Tab here. Examine the green circle and you’ll get it. Now to get 
the other Doll, head back to Terminal 1 and go right. You’ll see a Debuggest 
but you don’t have to fight it, just go around it. Now, you can see a door, 
which leads to an elevator, a path to the north and a shining dot, which is 
the Dust Chute. The Dust Chute will lead back to the first room in Geno Dome. 
You can leave Geno Dome but you have to repeat everything again once you 
return back. So, head to the path to the north. Enter the white door there and 
get the Elixir and the Lapis. After getting them, you’ll have to fight 3 Proto 
4s. Now head back and enter the room to the left of the Dust Chute. Use the 
elevator to go up. Above, you will finally find a Save Point. Restore your 
characters’ HP/MP then save. Now go back down again. I saved first to 
replenish my party’s HP/MP. Head to the north path and when you see the white 
door again, don’t enter it, instead, run up the conveyor belt. When you see a 
laser blocking your way to the right, head to the left and you’ll see Terminal 
3. Push the switch to open it up. But, if charge up Robo, you won’t be able to 
activate Terminal 3 because Robo’s charge will disappear before you even reach 
the terminal because the conveyor belt is running down. So, to reverse the 
conveyor belt, use the elevator in the room to the left of the chute. When you 
reach the save point, head south. Beat the 2 Laser Guards then take the chest 
in the corner for a Lapis. Now, head west and you’ll see a door with lasers. 
Turn the switch to remove the lasers and get the chest inside for a 
MegaElixir, there is also a Tab (I don’t know what yet) in the lower right of 
this room. After getting the item, you can get a Magic Tab beside the door 
then ,leave this room and continue heading left. When you see a ladder, go 
down from it. After climbing down, keep on walking until you see a chest, 
which contains 15000G. After getting the chest, head north and enter the white 
door. You’ll reach a place with conveyor belts carrying humans! Your party 
wants to save them but even Robo can’t do anything. In this room, head all the 
way to the right and you’ll notice a door below. Head south and you’ll reach a 
place with a chest containing a Full Ether. Now, head back to the Save Point. 
Use it if necessary. Now, head to the white door. Right after you enter a red 
room, take the shining Power Tab in the right corner. Continue heading north 
to the next room. You’ll meet 2 Proto 4s and 2 Laser Guards. After beating 
them, head through the door to the north. You’ll arrive an elevator, which 
will take you to the right of the large conveyor belt near Terminal 3. In this 
place, you’ll see 2 green arrow to your left. One is pointing to the right, 
and the other points to the left. Walk to it and you’ll reach the other side 
of the conveyor belt. Now, you’ll notice a switch here. To activate it, 
walk/run south until your party stops then head right. You can now activate 
this switch, which is fortunately the switch to reverse the large conveyor 
belt. You can now charge up Robo and activate Terminal 3. Now, go left then 
north and then right to be back on the other side of the conveyor belt. Do not 
enter the white door to the elevator, instead, head south, beat the enemies 
and activate the switch to turn of the laser blocking the conveyor belt. This 
way, you don’t have to go through the elevators again to reach the charge 
terminal. Now, run down the conveyor belt and charge Robo at the charge 
terminal. Run as fast as you can to reach Terminal 3 to open the door to left 
gaining access to the second guard robot. But before guiding the Robot to the 
one, which is guarding the Poyozo Doll, get the 2 chests for a Hyper Ether and 
a Full Ether. Now, guide the Robot to the first robot that you saw earlier who 
guards a chest and the second Poyozo Doll. To do this just walk and let the 
robot follow you. It’s the same thing when you guided the cat to the girl back 
at Leene’s Square at the beginning of the game. When you successfully brought 
the 2 robots to face each other, they will short circuit and you can now get a 
Vigil Hat from the chest and the Poyozo doll. Having both of the 2 Poyozo 
dolls, you can now get to the Mother Brain. To go there, head back to the Save 
Point. Head south and go left. Robo will be shocked at what he will see. His 
friend, Atropos insists that you kill your friend but Robo is a good robot and 
won’t hurt good people. So, Robo will have to deal with Atropos Alone.

Boss:  ATROPOS
#############################################################################
HP:  6000
EXP: -
TP:  -
G:   -
Item: Ribbon
Charmed Item: none

With only Robo to fight her, you’ll only have a few attacks in your arsenal. 
The best way to beat Atropos is to have Robo use his most powerful Techs. If 
Robo runs low in HP, use healing items then continue attacking. She is not 
that hard and you can beat her on the first try.
#############################################################################

After Robo beats Atropos, her ribbon will increase Robo’s speed by 3 and Magic 
Defense by 10! It’s time to pay a visit to that Mother Brain. Head to the 
left. You’ll see the ladder again, except now, don’t go down and continue 
moving left. Then head north and fight 6 Laser Guards. Head north once again 
and beat another batch of 6 Laser Guards. Now, put the Poyozo Dolls on the 
Green circles by examining them. The door in the middle will now open up. Go 
through it. You’ll meet the Mother Brain. It will still try to persuade Robo 
to come back but Robo’s artificial emotions won’t allow him. So, you have to 
deal with the Mother Brain once and for all.

Boss:  MOTHER BRAIN and 3 DISPLAYS
#############################################################################
Mother Brain’s HP:   4000
Displays’ HP (each): 300
EXP: 3000
TP:  40
G:   3000
Charmed Item: 3 Elixirs (Each Panel), Blue Mail (Mother Brain)

Once the fight has started, quickly destroy the 3 displays behind the mother 
brain as it will give 1000+ HP to the Mother Brain. They are not hard at all. 
Just use a Level 2 Magic and the 3 displays will vanish. Then, as with other 
bosses, use your characters’ most powerful Techs to beat the Mother Brain in 
no time at all. 

But beware, you must finish Mother brain quickly if you destroyed the 3 
panels. Every time the Mother Brain attacks, it’s defense and attack will 
greatly rise! If you let it live for a long time, you’ll surely get Ko’d. 
Here’s a strategy that I used to beat it.

Have Robo, Crono, and Marle in your party. You can prepare your characters 
here because the damage the Mother Brain does is quite little. Now, don’t beat 
the 3 panels yet. Have Marle cast Haste on EVERYONE and then, cast Lifeline. 
This will revive you incase you die. Now, after casting Haste and Lifeline 
wait until all of your timebars are filled. When all is filled up, use Crono’s 
Luminaire and then quickly use Robo and Marle’s Ice Tackle. This will cut of 
almost 3000 HP from the Mother Brain (This is in New Game not New Game+). The 
mother brain will then attack. This will increase it’s defense. But, use 
Luminaire and Ice Tackle once more. It will surely die! :)

New strategy by: Rubyheart (cadieux_philippe@hotmail.com):

If you don't want the Mother Brain to power up and the displays to heal her, 
cast Boogie. If it's not working yet, try again! Then, destroy the 
non-stopped displays and then use attacks that only hurts the mother brain. 
Final Kick, Triple Kick and Uzzi Punch are good examples of that kind of 
attacks.
#############################################################################

After Mother Brain disappears, Robo will examine a shining dot and he will 
receive the most powerful Arms in the game. The Terra Arm and the Crisis Arm. 
You’ll then be automatically taken back to the world map. That’s the end of 
this side-quest!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“And there’s a very special stone that can shine its light on each generation, 
from the distant past to the far future.”

For this side quest, you need to find the Sun Palace in the year 2300 AD. To 
get there, go to Arris Dome. Don’t disembark the Epoch yet. Then, head north 
and you’ll see an Island with a mountain. Disembark the Epoch and enter the 
Sun Palace. But before going there, be sure to give your party members fire 
protective armors as your next opponent is a fire-based entity.

SUN PALACE (2300 AD)
--------------------

Upon entering, head north and examine the shining dot. Then, the Son of Sun 
will arrive and attacks.

Boss:  SON OF SUN
#############################################################################
HP:  2500
EXP: 3800
TP:  40
G:   2000
Charmed Items: 1-5 Elixirs (flames), Black Mail (Son of Sun)

He is one of the hardest and weirdest enemies in CT. You have to guess which 
among the flames is the one that is associated with the Son of Sun himself. I 
mean that, one of the flames is real and if you managed to attack the real 
one, the Son of Sun will accumulate damage. If you are low in level and you 
have no fire protection, then you’re done for. His fire attacks are extremely 
powerful. Well, being the Son of Sun sure is HOT. To beat him, just guess 
which among the flames receive damage. After a couple of turns, the Son of Sun 
will shuffle the flames therefore forcing you to guess again. This battle 
might be a long and tedious one so be prepared and be patient. You’ll 
eventually kill him. It would also be easier if you have fire protection.

Easier Strategy: by Brandon Boucher (TheDOORS66@aol.com)

Before fighting the Son of Sun, make sure everyone in your party is equipped 
with Fire protection armors. This will make the attack of the Son of Sun 
useless. Also, with fire protection, you can concentrate in finding the flame 
what will damage the Son of Sun instead of healing and keeping up the HPs of 
your characters.

#############################################################################

After that battle, head all the way to the north and examine the Son of Sun. 
It will reveal the Moon Stone that you have to recharge to gain energy once 
more. As they say, it would take aeons. So, common sense comes into play, go 
back to 65,000,000 BC.

PRE-HISTORIC ERA (65,000,000 BC)
--------------------------------

Now, to reach the place where you have to put the Moon Stone, head to the 
Dactyl’s Nest and fly west until you see a small island with a mountain. Enter 
the cave and examine the shining dot at the end. Leave the Moon Stone and 
leave the mountain. Board the Epoch and go to 2300 AD. (Note: You can visit 
the Ioka Trading Hut and exchange 10 of every kind of item for the Ruby Armor)

SUN KEEP (2300 AD)
------------------

When you arrive, enter Sun Keep again. This time, the Moon Stone is gone so 
head back to 1000 AD.

SUN KEEP (1000 AD)
------------------

The stone isn’t here either. One of your party members will have a feeling 
that the Stone was stolen from this time period. To make sure, head back to 
600 AD.

SUN KEEP (600 AD)
-----------------
Item: 
   Power Tab

The Stone is still here! So definitely, it was stolen at 1000 AD. Before 
leaving, take the shining Power Tab, which is a bit to the left of the stone. 
Now, head back to 1000 AD.

PORRE VILLAGE (1000 AD)
-----------------------
Item:
   Shelter

Go to Porre, you notice one of the houses in here is shining! So, it must be a 
hint that the Stone is there. Go to the house. You notice that the Mayor won’t 
say anything about the Stone. The people around house despise the Mayor for 
his greedy attitude. Before leaving the House, go to the second floor and take 
the chest for a Shelter, don’t take the sealed chests yet, you have to make a 
decision later. Now, exit to the world map. Now, go to Snail Stop, which is 
directly to the east of the Manor. Buy the Jerky for 9900G! It’s outrageous 
but you have to. Now, head to 600 AD.

PORRE VILLAGE (600 AD)
----------------------

Go to the elder’s house and talk to the housewife. Give the Jerky to her, in 
short, don’t sell it. She promises that her descendants will be as sharing as 
you are. So, go back to 1000 AD. Before doing that, you have to make a 
decision here. If you want a White Vest and a Black Vest, and a White and a 
Black Mail, examine the two sealed chests and don’t take the contents. If you 
take the chests, you’ll only receive a White and Black Vest, which is inferior 
to the Mails.

PORRE VILLAGE (1000 AD)
-----------------------

Go to the Mayor’s manor. The attitude of the Mayor is opposite now. The people 
of the house praise his good attitude. Talk to the Mayor and he’ll give you 
the Sun Stone. Now, go to the second floor and take the Black Mail, the White 
Mail and the Shelter. Note that you will only receive both Mails if you 
examined them back at 600 AD and you did not take its contents. After getting 
the Sun Stone, you have to put it back on the Sun Keep. To find it, just head 
east of the Forest ruins in Medina.

SUN KEEP (1000 AD)
------------------

Leave the Moon Stone here as it is not yet recharged. Now, head to 2300 AD.

SUN KEEP (2300 AD)
------------------
Item/s:
   Wonder Shot
   Sun Shades
   Prism Specs
   Rainbow

When you reach the Moon Stone, which is now the Sun Stone, if Lucca’s with 
you, she’ll think of a way to make a weapon. If you don’t have her, head 
outside and get her into your party. Lucca will be amazed at the power it 
contains then afterwards, you’ll be taken to Lucca’s House. She will then make 
the most powerful weapon that she can wield. The Wonder Shot. Then, Taban will 
come in and will give to you the Sun Shades, which is derived also from the 
Sun Stone. Now, there is another man that can forge this stone. Melchior. If 
you finished the quest for the rainbow shell, go to Guardia Castle 1000 AD, 
talk to Melchior and he will forge the Sun Stone into the Prism Specs and also 
most Powerful weapon Crono can use, the Rainbow. Otherwise, finish the Rainbow 
Shell Quest first. It’s now the end of this side quest!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“There’s the ghost of a lofty knight, slain by Magus in the Middle Ages, who 
haunts the present.”

For this side quest, you need to go to the Town of Choras in 600 AD, which is 
directly East of Porre.

CHORAS VILLAGE (600 AD)
-----------------------
Item:
   Toma’s Pop

In this town you can now buy the Mid-ether from the market. After buying, if 
necessary, go to the Café, which is below the Inn. Talk to Toma here, he’s at 
the bar. Remember that you eavesdropped on him and the mayor of Porre way 
back? When you talk to him, you’ll get Toma’s Pop. He’ll tell you to pour it 
in his gravestone when you come back. After getting the item, talk to the man 
drinking in one of the tables. He’ll tell you that his tools were stolen. He 
needs the tools to repair the holes at the northern ruins, which is the goal 
of this side-quest. Now head back out to the world map. To get his tools, go 
to Choras in 1000 AD.

CHORAS VILLAGE (1000 AD)
------------------------
Item:
   Tools

In here, go to the Inn and talk to the man drinking there. He’ll tell you that 
you can get his tools from his wife. So go to the residence and talk to his 
wife. She will give you his tools. Now that you’ve got the tools head to 600 
AD.

CHORAS VILLAGE (600 AD)
-----------------------

When you arrive at 600 AD, go to the Café and talk to the man again. He will 
accept the tools and head off to his residence. Head out to the world map 
again and go to the residence. Talk to the man and he’ll call his workers and 
heads off to the ruins. Leave the residence and head to the Northern Ruins at 
the North east of Choras.

NORTHERN RUINS (600 AD)
-----------------------

Upon entering, the man and his workers will tell you that they cannot continue 
working because of the monsters. So, you have to cleanse the area first. There 
are two doors here. Take the left one first. Beat the Sentries here. Beware 
that when you beat a sentry, it will use grudge against you or use the dreaded 
MP Buster that will steal ALL MPs of a character. After beating ALL of the 
enemies here, head back to the entrance but don’t leave yet. Enter the door to 
the right. Beat all the skeletons you see here. After cleaning the area, head 
back to the residence. They will agree to fix the ruins for 2000G pay them and 
return to the ruins.

Before returning back, take Frog with you. Upon entering, take the door to the 
left. You can now reach the grave of Cyrus. When you reach the grave, Cyrus 
will appear then a short dialogue will commence. After that, the Masamune will 
break into 2 again. Masa and Mune. They decided go give more power to the 
Masamune blade so they merge again and thus a new and more powerful Masamune 
Blade is made. After this, leave the Ruins again and talk to the repairmen 
again and pay 2000 G. Now, head to the ruins and use the right door right 
after you enter. You now have access to the places blocked by the holes 
before. Examine the 3 Sealed Chests here and DO NOT take the contents. Beware 
also of the Defunct and the Base, they are the worst enemies here in the 
ruins. If you can’t beat the defunct, the base will fuse with the defunct 
creating a departed, which do a very big amount of damage. Need I say more? 
They have a very high defense too. After examining the sealed chests, head 
back out to the world map and use the Epoch to go to 1000 AD.

HERO’S GRAVE (1000 AD)
----------------------
Item/s:
   Hyper Ether
   Magic Tab
   Power Tab
   Moon Armor or Nova Armor
   Shiva Edge or Kali Blade
   Valkerye or Siren
   Elixir

Go to the Ruins, which is now named the Hero’s Grave. On the left side you can 
get a Hyper Ether and a shining Magic Tab near the grave of Cyrus. Now, head 
back near the entrance and take the right door. Just as you reach the next 
screen, get the Power Tab in the lower left corner of the room. And then, go 
through the door. You can get powerful equipments like the Moon Armor, a Shiva 
Edge for Crono and Marle’s most powerful weapon, the Valkerye. There is an 
elixir on the chest also. Now, you may notice that the equipments that you got 
are upgrades of the contents of the sealed chest, which means that when you 
return some time in the past, the normal items will still be stored there. So, 
head back to 600 AD and take the equipments again. You can get the Nova Armor, 
Kali Blade, and Siren. You can also get the Elixir and the Hyper Ether from 
the chests located inside Hero’s Grave. After you got everything you have 
finished this quest!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“There’s an object in the middle ages that sparkles like a rainbow.”

For this side-quest, head to Choras Village in 600 AD which is directly to the 
east of Porre.

CHORAS VILLAGE (600 AD)
-----------------------

Go to the Café and talk to Toma at the bar. Remember that you’ve eavesdropped 
on him and the mayor of Porre way back? After talking to him, he’ll give you 
his Pop. He wants you to pour it on his grave when he dies. So, head back out 
to the world map and use the epoch to go to Choras in 1000 AD.

CHORAS VILLAGE (1000 AD)
------------------------
Item:
   Speed Tab

Go to the northwest of the village and you’ll see the West cape. Enter it. At 
the end, you’ll see the Grave of Toma Levine. Examine it to pour his pop. Toma 
will appear and will tell you about the Giant’s Claw which is to the Northwest 
of this place. To make it easy, return to 600 AD and head to the northwest of 
where Toma’s grave is supposed to be and you’ll find the Giant’s Claw. Take 
note of the Speed Tab behind the grave of Toma.

GIANT’S CLAW (600 AD)
---------------------
Item/s:
   Sight Cap        Lapis
   3 Power Tabs     Frenzy Band
   Full Ether
   Blue Rock
   Zodiac Cape

Upon entering, you’ll see Toma’s note. After examining and reading it, head 
south to the door. You’ll reach a very familiar room. Your character will 
recognize that this was the Tyrano Lair where you fought with Azala back in 
65,000,000 BC. After the dialogue, continue heading south to the door. In this 
next area, you’ll find a chest and a door to the left and a ladder below. 
Examine the chest first. A Gigasaur and 2 Leapers will appear. To beat them, 
and any other dinosaurs, use Crono’s Lightning magic to decrease their 
defenses then you are allowed to attack. After beating them, examine the chest 
again for a Sight Cap. Now, go down the ladder. Head to the door on the far 
right. You’ll reach a room with 3 switches and a skull. First, switch the one 
on the top to reveal a Save Point. Then, push the left switch among the 2 on 
the bottom to open the floors. Then, push the right one and some monsters will 
fall down. Now, this maybe crazy but you have to jump down the hole too. 
Below, you’ll meet 2 Fossil Apes. Beat them. In here, push the left switch 
first. The mouth will open so go there. Get the shining Power Tab here. Head 
all the way to the south and enter the door. Don’t push the right switch as it 
will only invite enemies. When you reach the next area, you’ll notice a 
shining dot on the right. To get it, head right and go down the ladder you 
see. Then, head right and get the Power Tab. Now, head all the way to left 
past the ladder and get the chest for a Full Ether. Now, head up the ladder 
and go left. Move along until a Fossil Ape and 2 Leapers attack you. Beat 
them, then get the chest for the Blue Rock. Now, head south to the door. On 
the other side, head right until you see 2 ladders. Go down the one below. 
Now, head all the way to the left to get a partially hidden chest that 
contains a Zodiac Cape. Then, head right a bit and go down the Ramp. You’ll 
see another ladder here. But before you go down that ladder. Head all the way 
to the right to get yet another chest that contains a Lapis. Now head left and 
go down the ladder. You may be wondering why you did not use the long ladder 
on top. It’s because it lead you back to where you came from. Let’s continue, 
after going down the ladder, head left and enter the door. In here, beat the 
enemies you see. Head north. You’ll see 2 skulls here. Enter the one on the 
left, taking note of the shining dot on the right side, then head up the 
ladder. In this area, there 2 enemies on both sides. Just activate the 2 
switches here and the monsters will fall. There are 2 doors to the south. 
Enter the left one first and get the Frenzy Band inside. Head out and you’ll 
have to fight the 2 monsters. There’s no way you can reach the switch. After 
fighting, enter the other door, which is to the right. Move along until you 
find an egg. Examine it and you’ll fall down. You’ll arrive in another 
familiar place, which is the jail for the Ioka Villagers. When you reach the 
door, head to the left first to get the shining dot back where the 2 skulls 
were which contains a Power Tab. Return back to where the jail is and head all 
the way to the right and go down the ladder. Finally, a Save Point. I suggest 
you use it because your characters maybe weak right now after all that 
fighting. After using the save point, head left and activate the switch beside 
the door. Head all the way to the north and you’ll meet a very familiar being. 
It’s Tyrano. Try to get past it, but it will stop and fight you as Rust 
Tyrano.

Boss:  RUST TYRANO
#############################################################################
HP:  25000
EXP: 3800
TP:  40
G:   2000
Charmed Item: Red Mail

In the beginning of the fight, Tyrano will start counting down from 5. At this 
moment, use the most powerful Single Techs of your characters. Do not use Dual 
or Triple Techs as its damage is lesser than each of the single techs 
combined. He’s so hard to beat at levels 30 below.
#############################################################################

After beating Rust Tyrano, you can finally head north and get the rainbow 
shell. Your party will try to carry it but it’s too heavy so one of you 
suggests that you seek help from Guardia Castle. When you regain control of 
your characters, just walk/run south and the screen will fade. You’ll be taken 
automatically to the throne room of Guardia Castle. After the Kings orders the 
Knight Captain to get the shell, talk to everyone in the throne room then 
leave the castle. Outside, board the Epoch and go to 1000 AD.

GUARDIA KINGDOM (1000 AD)
-------------------------

Upon disembarking the Epoch, add Marle to your party, then enter the castle.

GUARDIA CASTLE (1000 AD)
------------------------
Item/s:
   3 Hyper Ethers
   2 Elixirs
   2x Lapis
   Yakra Key
   3 Prism Helms or 1 Prism Dress
   Red Vest or Red Mail (Sealed Chest)

Inside, Marle will be greet by a kind-hearted Chancellor. He’ll tell you about 
her Father and her Mother. Then, he asks you to visit your father who is in 
trial for selling the treasures of the kingdom. Now, all the paths will be 
sealed so head right and you’ll see 2 doors. The one on the left has 2 stairs. 
Take the stair leading up. On the way, take the chest for a Hyper Ether. The 
second one will be locked so continue moving. At the end, talk to the guards 
and Marle will blast her way through to the courtroom. You’ll see the 
chancellor frame the King. Marle will be taken away because of interrupting 
the trial. One of you will suggest finding the Rainbow Shell. So, head back to 
the 2 doors and take the right one. You’ll see that the guard is down and was 
attacked by the monsters. Head right then up, beat those pathetic monsters. 
One simple attack can kill ‘em. On the second batch on enemies, get 3 among 
the 5 chests for a Hyper Ether, an Elixir, and a Lapis. You can’t get the two 
because they are blocked. Continue heading north. At the end you’ll see the 
Rainbow Shell. Get the 3 chests here for a Hyper Ether, an Elixir, and a 
Lapis. You can’t get the others as they are blocked and you can’t reach them. 
Examine the Rainbow Shell and you’ll get a letter from Queen Leene. Marle then 
takes the Prism Shard as proof of the existence of the Rainbow Shell in the 
Castle. Go back to the Court Room but the 2 Guards won’t let you enter. Marle 
has something in her mind. In the courtroom, the King is charged guilty of 
selling the treasure. But Marle suddenly bursts in from behind and blew the 
chancellors plot. The chancellor has no other choice but to fight as the 
descendant of Yakra. He is Yakra XIII.

Boss:  YAKRA XIII
#############################################################################
HP:  19000
EXP: 3500
TP:  -
G:   2000
Item: MegaElixir
Charmed Item: White Mail

He is quite hard. He will attack with Chaos that will confuse your characters 
if they have no protection against status ailments. And, when you damaged him 
by 10000 he will begin attacking you with much stronger attacks. All you have 
to do is to have Marle be the healer because she has a complete set of 
Curative Magic, then have the other 2 characters attack Yakra with their most 
powerful Tech. Beware also because after you beat him he’ll unleash his final 
attack that damages all your characters by 200+. So keep your HPs above 300 as 
much as possible.
#############################################################################

After you beat Yakra, you’ll see a very touching scene between Marle and her 
Father. As they are talking take note of the location of the shining dot that 
appeared. After that, you’ll be taken to the throne room when Melchior 
suddenly comes in. He will tell you that he will make equipments from the 
Rainbow Shell. But before going to the Rainbow shell, head to the courtroom 
first and examine the shining dot. You’ll get the Yakra Key. On the way, 
you’ll see the Chest you bypassed a while ago. Examine it and the Yakra Key 
will be used to free the real chancellor. Now, head to the Rainbow Shell. Talk 
to Melchior and he will let you choose between 1 Prism Dress, which has 
Maximum Defense, and 3 less-effective Prism Helms. As for me, I chose the 
Prism Dress as it has the Maximum Magic Defense for a female character. That’s 
the end of this side-quest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIDE QUEST #7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“One of you is close to someone who needs help, find this person… fast.”

Error here. Sorry about what I posted the last time. I told you that this was 
connected to Side Quest #6. But in fact, it isn’t. Side Quest 7 actually 
refers to Zeal, Magus’ mother and the Black Omen. Here’s the guide on the 
Black Omen. It was formerly the Ocean Palace, which rose from the ground. You 
can find it floating in the time periods, 12,000 BC, 600 AD, and 1000 AD. To 
enter the Black Omen just fly the Epoch towards it. When, the name Black Omen 
appears, press Action.

Note: If you try to enter the Black Omen in 2300 AD, the door will be locked. 
It is because Queen Zeal is already with Lavos in 1999 and is no longer inside 
the Black Omen. Thanks to Colin Kemege (hydra400@hotmail.com) for reminding me 
about this.

BLACK OMEN (12,000 BC: 600 AD: 1000 AD)
------------------------------------------------
Item/s:
   4 MegaElixirs    Power Seal
   30000 G          4 Speed Tabs
   Magic Seal       White Rock
   2 Elixirs
   Vigil Hat 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Tips:
When you finish with the Black Omen in 1000 AD, you can go back in 600 AD and 
beat the entire Black Omen again with the items and everything. After that, 
you can go back once more to 12,000 BC to get another shot at the Black Omen. 
This way, you can get lots of money, experience, and equipments.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Right after you arrive on the Black Omen, you’ll see a shining dot. If you 
examine it, it will let you board the Epoch. Now, head north, beat those Laser 
Guards and enter the door. You’ll see Queen Zeal. She’ll talk a bit then 
summon the Mega Mutant, which you have to fight.

Boss:  MEGA MUTANT
#############################################################################
Upper Body:  5000
Lower Body:  5000
EXP: 900
TP:  50
G:   1500
Charmed Item: Elixir

He is rather easy. Just use any Tech to attack him. He will inflict your 
characters with status ailments most of the time. But, now you might have 99 
Heals to restore status, so this is not a problem.
#############################################################################

After beating the Mega Mutant, head north then right. In this area, head 
north. You’ll meet 2 Goons on the way. Continue heading north and you’ll see a 
Save Point to your right. But before that, you have to fight 2 Synchrites and 
a Martello. After the fight, use the save point. After saving, continue 
heading north to the next area. In here, head north. Beat the panels on your 
way. In the next area, you’ll have to fight the Boss Orb and his 2 sidekicks. 
Head north, beat the enemies then head left at the very top. In this area, 
fight your way to the north. You’ll reach a Teleporter at the end. Use it. 
Head south and you’ll reach an elevator. Examine the shining dot on the left. 
The elevator will start to go down. You’ll fight enemies here. First, 2 Cybots 
that almost looks like Gato at Leene’s Square. Next, 4 Ruminators. Then, the 
elevator will stop. Head north through the door. In this area, beat the Boss 
Orb and the 2 Sidekicks. After beating them, head right then up. You’ll 
another batch of Boss Orb and sidekicks. Keep on moving until you see a 
ladder. Don’t go up yet. Head right and get the chest for a MegaElixir. Now, 
head up the steps and go left first to get another chest containing 30000G! 
Now head north. After you beat the enemies, the path will split into 2. Take 
the right one. Get the chest for a Magic Seal. Now, head north to the door. In 
the next area, get the 2 chests you see for an Elixir and a Vigil Hat. Head a 
bit north and you’ll see a save point. Take the 2 chests for a Nova Armor and 
a Megaelixir. Then, use the save point. Head north first, past the 2 Nus and 
get the chests for a Haste Helm and a MegaElixir. Now, the left Nu will sell 
you items that can restore your HPs and MPs. The right Nu will offer you the 
ride back to the Epoch if you want to leave this place. If you decide to go 
on, examine the wall to the north and a door will appear. Enter the door. Move 
on and you’ll encounter a Tubster. 

Here, you can charm the Tubster for a Power Tab then after beating it, return 
to where the two Nus were. Then, head back to the Tubster and you can charm it 
again for a Power Tab. Continue on doing this as many times as you want.

Now, from the Tubster head north. Fight your way through until you see 
Ruminators running at the top. Try to get the chest for a Zodiac Cape then 
head right to where the ruminators are going. Now, move on and fight your way 
through. Get the chest on the way for a MegaElixir. Move on to the next area. 
In this area, get the chest for a Power Seal. Continue heading south. After 
you fight a Cybot and a Martello, there’s a partially hidden chest at the 
lower right at the very bottom. Get it for a Speed Tab. Head to the lower left 
door to the next area. Get the chest past the door for another Speed Tab. 
Then, go through the door. In here, there’s a Teleporter in the middle so use 
it. This next area is quite big. So, here how to get through. Head left at the 
first intersection then continue moving past the statue in the middle until 
the next intersection. Head south first for a chest containing an Elixir. Now, 
head all the way to the north until you can go any further. Use the steps on 
the right. Go all the way to the right the head north. Get the chest that you 
see here. It contains a Speed Tab. Then, get the other chest for a MegaElixir. 
Move on to the door. You’ll see a save point in the next area. Use it, I 
insist. When you head north, you’ll face..

Boss:  GIGA MUTANT
#############################################################################
Upper Body:  7000
Lower Body:  6000
EXP: 1500
TP:  80
G:   2000
Charmed Item: Wall Ring (Upper Body), Hit Ring (Lower Body)

He is not that hard. Just use your characters’ most powerful techs. If you 
remember, he inflicts status ailments to your party when Giga was still Mega. 
Now, he will drain your MPs during the battle. Just use items to restore HP or 
MP and you’ll beat him for sure. And most of all, don’t use physical attacks 
as they are not effective against him.
#############################################################################

After you beat Giga Mutant, head back to the save point and use it. Now head 
all the way to the north to a Teleporter. You’ll reach another elevator. 
You’ll fight 4 Ruminators then 2 Cybots. After the elevator stops, head north 
to the door. Keep on moving, fighting enemies on the way, until you reach the 
very top door. Go in. You’ll fight 4 Panels. After you beat them, a Save point 
will appear. Get the chest above the steps first for a Speed Tab. Then, use 
the save point. Head to the right steps and go north. You’ll meet..

Boss:  TERRA MUTANT
#############################################################################
Upper Body:  6500
Lower Body:  2000
EXP: 2000
TP:  100
G:   3800
Charmed Item: Muscle Ring (Upper Body), Power Seal (Lower Body)

He is hard the third time around. The upper body is weak against Magic, but, 
the lower body will drain any magic attack you use on it. So, use Magic 
attacks on the upper part. Also, the upper part will drain 1000+ HP from the 
lower part. If you attack the Lower Part, it will counter with a Life Shaver 
that drops your character’s HP to 1!

Here’s a strategy. Have Crono, Ayla and Marle in your party. Have Marle cast 
Haste on everyone. During this time, have Ayla charm the upper and the lower 
body first and Crono should use his Luminaire. The lower body will drain the 
Luminaire but it will be a very small amount. Now, After Marle finishes 
casting Haste on everyone, use Marle and Ayla’s Cube Toss on the upper body 
and continue using Crono’s Luminaire. After the upper body is gone, the lower 
body will also die.
#############################################################################

After beating Terra Mutant, get the chests for a MegaElixir and the White 
Rock. I suggest you go back and use the save point. Head all the way to the 
north and you’ll meet..

Boss:  LAVOS SPAWN

HP:  10000
EXP: 2450
TP:  ?
G:   2500
Charmed Item: Haste Helm (Head), Safe Helm (Shell)

He is harder that the Spawns at Death Peak. He has much more powerful attacks 
that the 3 Lavos spawns at Death Peak combined! Just use Single Techs that 
affect one enemy on the head. Whatever you do, don’t attack the shell. It will 
counter with a powerful attack against all your characters. Just attack the 
head and you’ll be safe.
#############################################################################

After you beat the spawn, continue heading north. You’ll arrive in a place 
where there are 5 Panels, after you beat them, a save point and a door will 
appear. Use the save point first. Head north and you’ll meet..

Boss:  QUEEN ZEAL

Charmed Item: MegaElixir

Her first attack, the Hallation, will drop all your characters’ HP to 1 so 
heal right away. Then, use your characters’ most powerful single Techs. She’ll 
also use Hallation frequently so be ready to heal anytime.
#############################################################################

After you beat Queen Zeal, you’ll be taken to another battle with the Mammon 
Machine.

Boss:  MAMMON MACHINE
#############################################################################
HP:  16000
EXP: -
TP:  -
G:   -
Charmed Item: MegaElixir

The mammon machine is not that hard. It increases its defense every time you 
use physical attacks. So, use Magic attacks. It will increase the attack power 
of the Mammon machine but you can deal a decent amount of damage instead of 
using physical attacks until it will be useless against it.
#############################################################################

After you beat the Mammon machine you’ll be taken to yet another battle. This 
time, it’s serious.

Boss:  ZEAL

EXP: -
TP:  -
G:   -
Charmed Item: Prism Dress (Left Hand), Prism Helm (Right Hand),
              MegaElixir (Head)

She is tough! If you use magic on the hands, it will counter attack with MP 
Buster, which will reduce your MP to 0, and the Life Shaver, which will reduce 
your HP to 1. So, make sure 2 of your characters are efficient at healing. To 
beat her easier, attack only the head with Single Techs that affect one enemy 
only. This way, the hands won’t be able to counter attack. She does Hallation 
though. :)
#############################################################################

Right after the fight, again, you’ll see Lavos himself. You have to fight him 
at once as this is the beginning of the End. For the strategy, refer to the 
Lavos strategy right before Side Quest #1. That’s it for the 7 Side Quests.

and tells Crono that he has to carry out his sentence at the castle. You’ll 
then be automatically brought to Guardia Castle. Marle will defend you but, 
the king already knows what you did throughout time. All your friends will 
come from the different eras you’ve been. Kino from the pre-historic, Doan 
from the future and King Guardia XXI from the Middle Ages. Your execution will 
be lifted and you can join the final night of the festival at Leene’s Square. 
At Leene’s square, there will be a parade wherein Crono and Marle will join. 
When you regain control of your characters, head to where Lucca’s invention 
it. One by one, all the characters will return to their respective times. 
You’ll see the princess kiss the frog here! After everyone leaves, Crono’s 
cats will come and enter the gate. The number of cats depends on how many 
you’ve won from Norstein Bekkler’s Lab at Leene’s Square. Then, Crono’s mom 
will go after them and will be trapped in the gate. You then have to go and 
find her. Meanwhile, a soldier will come in and tell you that her father needs 
Marle. Go to where Leene’s Bell is and the king will introduce to you the 
Nadia’s Bell, which will replace the old Leene’s Bell. Marle, senses adventure 
again because Crono’s Mom is lost in time. They’ll leave the king and travel 
through time again in search for Crono’s Mother. Then, the credits will start 
to show up. You’ll see in the background the Epoch visiting many places. 
Including also all the time periods where you traveled on your journey and the 
respective characters that you’ve met there. Then, the Epoch will fly away. 
That’s one of the beautiful endings of Chrono Trigger.

Variations:
- If you killed Magus, Frog will be in his original form, Glenn.
- If you weren’t able to punch in L.A.R.A. at Lucca’s House where you must
  save Lucca’s mom from the machine, Lucca’s Mom will be sitting instead of 
  standing.
- If you fought Lavos by using the Epoch to go to 1999 AD, Crono and Marle
  will fly off with balloons. If you didn’t, that is the time the cats will
  go to the Time Gate.
- In the Guardia Castle throne room, if you freed the Chancellor after 
  beating the 2nd Yakra, he will be in the throne room. If not, Pierre will
  be there instead.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Ending #2: You can trigger this ending by the following conditions:
           - You examined the shining dot on the right pod of Lucca’s
             teleportation device at Leene’s Square right after you
             get Marle in the beginning of the game.
           - You defeated Lavos in the Ocean Palace therefore, preventing
             the Death of Crono.

This one’s a weird way to finish the game and it is the hardest one to get. It 
can only be possible in the New Game+ Mode. Note that there are some secrets 
of Chrono Trigger that will be revealed here. Including the hint about the 
total number of endings Chrono Trigger has. Right after you get Marle to join 
Crono in the beginning, the right pod of Lucca’s Teleportation device will 
show a shining dot. 

Note that you can actually have Marle with you. Right after reaching the place 
where Lucca’s Pod is, examine the right pod right away with Marle in your 
party. This will let Marle help you in the battle against Lavos.

If you examine it, you’ll fight Lavos at once! I recommend you do this only if 
you meet the following requirements. Level 60+, Power,Magic,Magic Def,Speed 
are all at Maximum. You have Crono’s Rainbow, a Gold Stud, the Safe Helm and 
the Nova Armor. With this equipment, you’ll still have to fight Lavos for a 
long time. Because, only Crono can fight Lavos. It would be one on one. Here’s 
the description of the ending. After beating Lavos, Crono will be teleported 
to an odd place.

You’ll see a couple of characters here. They are quite familiar because you 
already knew them from your previous game. This ending is merely the 
development room of Chrono Trigger. It means that, the names of the characters 
around here are actually the staff that created the game itself. 

For the information about Chrono Trigger I will write the details here. 

*** Spoiler Alert ***
(I’ll be using the name of the characters which is used in the game)

Main Room. You’ll see Gaspar, a Nu and a boy. The Boy will ask something about 
the Raiders and the Cowboys (are they Football or Baseball teams? They’re too 
familiar). Next, Gaspar will tell you where you actually are. He’ll tell you 
that you’re in the development room for Chrono Trigger and you already 
finished the hardest level of Chrono Trigger. He’ll tell you that you can go 
around and talk to the other characters then finally, come back to him again. 
Next, the Nu will tell you about his anti-stress Massage Technique. 

Next, head right towards where the Epoch was stationed. Talk to Spekkio and 
he’ll ask something about the Dodgers w/c I think has something to do with 
what the boy in the main room said. Now, head all the way to the right and go 
all the way up. You’ll see a Barrel and a cat. The Barrel will tell you 
something about a switch, which I don’t know yet as of now. Then the Cat will 
reveal to you that there are 10 endings in the game. You probably have seen 2 
or more endings right now. Then, head back to the main room and head left to 
the room with pillars of light. 

You’ll see a Poyozo Doll jump around. It will tell you about the Poyozo Dance 
Attack. If you don’t know yet, it is the Triple Tech Poyozo Dance of Ayla, 
Marle and Lucca in which one of them has the White Rock equipped. Then, walk 
clockwise and you’ll eventually jump over the fence and into the statue. The 
statue will say a very meaningful sentence. “Every night will have a day. Even 
forever has to come to an end.”  .. “I think.” :) Next, talk to Magus He’ll 
tell you that they are kept too long in the making of this game. Now, time to 
visit the pillars of light. Here’s a diagram of the pillars. Just go near the 
pillars to enter them. 

          *Magus is here*

  #1    #2    #3

  #4          #5
  
  #6    #7    #8

#1: The people here will just talk about how long they created the game. And 
will give some kind of a hint about Chrono Trigger 2 (Isn’t it Chrono Cross 
for PSX?)

#2: Ayla will hint about the point attack (normal attack) that causes 9999 
damage. It can only be done with Ayla’s Bronze Fist (Ayla at Level 99)

#3: When you speak to Toma, he’ll set off for his own adventure. Take a look 
also at the note on the top of the drawers telling you not to look for that 
person.

#4: Someone will tell you that Chrono Trigger is tough but wait till you get a 
hold of Final Fantasy 2.

#5: One character here will tell you that it was his idea to use the mouth as 
the switch in Tyrano Lair. The frog wants someone to kiss him. Better call the 
princess. 

#6: You’ll be shocked here! When you examine the shining dot it will say: 
Restart..1..2..3 then the screen goes blank. I almost shouted in dismay, but 
the screen returned and he said he was only joking (almost too real to be a 
joke). 

#7: The roly here will tell you about the high score of 2110 in the bike race. 
I can’t even reach 1500! 

#8: Just talk to everyone here. Masa will talk about other SquareSoft titles. 
In my honest opinion, EVERY Square game I’ve seen is great! If not, perfect! 
Sample titles (Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Chrono Trigger, Parasite 
Eve, Xenogears, Legend of Mana, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, Ergheiz 
(the only fighting game of Square, I think), Chocobo Racing, Chocobo’s 
Dungeon, Front Mission 3, Mario RPG, and many many more!

After talking to everyone, talk to Gaspar. He will open the door to Spekkio’s 
Place and you’ll see the Dream Team inside. The Main staff of Chrono Trigger. 
After talking to them you’ll see the shortest credits that I’ve seen! It just 
rolled up in a blink of an eye. Then, the words, The End will show up and 
then, congratulate yourself for beating this game!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Ending #3: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Right after you beat the first Yakra in the Cathedral, when
             you return back to Leene’s Square 1000 AD, examine the shining
             dot on the right pod of Lucca’s Device to fight Lavos. You can
             only use Crono and Marle to fight Lavos.

This is another weird ending. After you beat Lavos, you’ll return back to 
Leene’s Square. The people became weird here. If you talk to people, they will 
tell Marle to remove her disguise. Go to the exit and talk to the 2 men there. 
You will then be brought to the Castle. The king will also tell Marle to 
remove her disguise. It was because of the picture that is 400 years old. Frog 
kissed Queen Leene!!! Therefore, Marle is half-frog and human! 

By the way, few credits will be shown in a projector type frames. Then, “The 
End” will show up on the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #4: You can trigger this ending by the following conditions:
           - On your first visit to the End of Time, examine the Bucket here
             and beat Lavos.
           - In New Game+ mode, after you beat Heckran, examine the shining
             dot in the right pod of Lucca’s Device at Leene’s Square.

Not much for an ending. The credits will be shown right away and monsters will 
scroll to the left. Specifically, you’ll see a Nu and an Amphibite do crazy 
things. A kilwala will also show up. Then finally, after all the three 
monsters fall asleep, the end will show up, sleeping. ZZ.zz.ZZ.zz..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #5: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Once you arrive in 600 AD for the second time. Come back to 
             the end of time and examine the bucket to fight Lavos.

The credits will show up and you’ll hear the Music of Robo. Then, you’ll see 
Robo come out from a gate into the year 2300 AD. But, you’ll see Leene’s Bell 
in the middle. Then, just like a re-enactment of what happened between Marle 
and Crono, Robo will bump into a Lady Robot (her name is Atropos). Then, 
they’ll leave. Credits will show up again. Then, you’ll see Robo and Atropos 
on top of a mountain enjoying the view. After a few credits, the music will 
fade. Surprisingly, you’ll see Guardia Castle in 600 AD. You’ll see the King 
and Queen here. A boy (Tata) will be sitting on the throne (he was thought to 
be the hero in 600 AD because of the Hero Medal. It was not his though.). 
Next, you’ll see Tata through a castle (Magus’ Castle). It will show how Tata 
went through the Castle of Magus. But, surprisingly, Tata will see Crono, 
Marle and Lucca. After that, a scrolling credits will be shown and then the 
words “the end” will show up. The End! :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #6: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Right after you get the Hero Medal from Tata, beat Lavos using
             the bucket at the end of time

The credits will show up first. The background music will be the ones when you 
are traveling the world aboard the Epoch. You party will be shown coming out 
of the Gate in Medina Village 1000 AD. Then, credits will be shown again. 
After that, you’ll see a prehistoric boy (Kino) with 2 villagers chasing 2 
Reptites. Then, Kino and co. will run scared because they are now the ones 
being chased by a pack of reptites. Then, the reptites is now being chased 
again. But now, Ayla will be the one chasing them (The reptites really have a 
reason to run for their lives). In the next scene, you’ll see Magus on top of 
a mountain, together with his generals Ozzie, Slash and Flea. The next scene 
after this will be at Guardia Castle Circa 600 AD with King Guardia and Queen 
Leene. Then, Frog will be shown. After that, some credits will be shown again. 
Finally, you’ll see Robo. He’ll fool around the screen then he will say “The 
End”. Well, that’s it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #7: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Examine the bucket at the End of Time right after you receive 
             Gate Key from Azala, who stole it from you after the festivities
             In Ioka Village 65,000,000 BC.

You’ll see the credits alongside with the different characters from the game. 
Here are the characters that you will see. They are arrange in the order of 
their appearance. Elder in 65,000,000 BC. Toma, Glenn and Tata. Norstein 
Bekkler. The Chef in Guardia Castle 600 AD and his brother, the knight 
captain. The prehistoric band. Masa and Mune. A female dancer. A rat! Ozzie, 
Slash and Flea. Old man at the End of Time (Gaspar). The racers in Leene’s 
Square together with a Kilwala (Catalack, Steel Runner, Green Ambler, w/o G.I. 
Jogger). 2 Enlightened Ones. Johnny and 2 Proto 4s. Schala, Janus and his cat. 
The Epoch. A Note. 2 small frogs. Krawlie and a Scout. Chancellor of Guardia 
in 1000 AD w/ 6 soldiers. Chancellor of Guardia in 600 AD w/ 6 soldiers. Kino, 
a boy, and a Dactyl. Doan, a man and a kid. Prehistoric babes. The 3 Gurus, 
Belthasar, Melchior and Gaspar.  

The screens, following the 3 gurus won’t have characters. At the end, the 
words “The End” will be shown with the Pendant of Marle. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #8: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Immediately after giving the fully repaired Masamune to Frog,
             go to the End of Time and use the bucket and beat Lavos.

In the first scene, you’ll be at Lucca’s house where Lucca is fixing Robo 
while Crono and Frog are resting. Lucca will try to wake up Crono then Marle 
will come in and tells Lucca to let Crono rest. Then, Frog will decide to 
leave. But, he slipped and fell down. Marle laughed at Frog and so does Lucca. 
A Credit will then show up. Then, you’ll see the Castle of Magus. In the next 
scene, you’ll see Slash then, Flea. After that, you’ll see the shadow of Frog 
in the tower of the castle. Then, you’ll see Frog slay Ozzie. The scene after 
that would be at Magus’ room. Frog will show up. Then, credits will be shown 
while you hear sound from the fight of Frog and Magus. After the credits and 
the fight, you’ll see the Castle of Magus. On top of it, you’ll see the 
victor. I really think that’s Frog who won. That’s The End. 

Note: You may be wondering why Frog is somewhat in human form. Of course! Once 
he beats Magus, the curse, Magus put on frog will break and Frog will return 
to being the sidekick of Cyrus, Glenn.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #9: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
           - Right after you beat Magus in his Lair, go to the End of Time
             through Mystic Mountains and use the bucket to beat Lavos

WAAAAAAHH!!! Everyone’s a Reptite! During the following scenes, the credits 
will scroll. In the first scene, you’ll see Crono’s mom wake up Crono then 
there will be a scene downstairs. After that, you’ll see Truce Inn. The next 
scene, would be at the Leene Square. You’ll notice that Green Ambler is not 
included in the running game. Instead, a man will take its place. :) Then, 
you’ll see the scene where Crono bumped into Marle. Only, they are reptites 
now. Finally, you’ll see Azala (In my opinion, he’s King Guardia). Then, the 
words “The End” will fall on the head of Azala.

Note: Wondering why everybody here are apes? It’s because you were unable to 
help Ayla beat Azala therefore, the reptites ruled the world.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #10: You can trigger this ending by the following conditions:
            - After you beat Azala and Black Tyrano, you’ll see a Gate where
              Lavos fell, right? So, use the gate. You’ll arrive in 12,000 BC
              So, use the gate again and you’ll be at the End of time where
              You can use the Bucket. Again.
            - Right after you get the Epoch for the first time, use the time
              dial to go to 1999 AD then beat Lavos.

First, credits will be shown. Then, a scene wherein Frog visits Magus’ Statue. 
After that scene, you’ll see a room with Schala, Queen Zeal and the prophet 
(he’s actually Magus. He also went to 12,000 BC through the gate where Tyrano 
Lair was). Next, you’ll see Frog with some people in Porre including Tata and 
Toma. In the next scene, you’ll see Magus, Schala and Janus again. After 
another scene with Magus, you’ll see your party at Leene’s Square. Then, 
you’ll see Magus again. And after that, you’ll see a scene wherein Crono, 
Marle, Robo, Lucca and Crono’s mom are talking and stove is burning! Finally 
you’ll see Magus and he’ll utter some lines. A few credits will be shown 
afterwards. The End.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #11: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
            - Right after Schala Opens the Sealed Door at Zeal Palace, go all
              the way back to the Gate and Use it. Fight Lavos using the 
              Bucket. REMEMBER, do not use the Mammon Machine. Immediately
              After Schala opens the door, go directly to the End of Time.

First, you’ll see the Words The End show up. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST 
HUMOROUS ENDING I’VE SEEN!!! Marle and Lucca will then talk about the words 
“The End”. Next, Lucca and Marle will host a slideshow of what happened in 
your journey. Here are the scenes:

First, you’ll see Lucca and Marle tease the Steel Runner (they’re right! 
Imagine the smell on the inside. Ewww!) Then, a soldier from Guardia Castle 
who winked at Lucca! After that, you’ll see Pierre. Your lawyer back in the 
trial. Next, you’ll see a man who holds the seed for the future. Then, Johnny, 
Mr. Speed himself! After that, you’ll see Cyrus. Lucca has a Crush on him. 
Next, you’ll see Toma. Next, you’ll see Kino. I laughed about the statements 
of Lucca. “Total Neanderthal! Throw him a bone!”, “He walks like a Duck!”. AT 
LAST CRONO TALKED!!! CRONO TALKED! CRONO TALKED! My goodness! After this 
scene, the real “The End” will show up. That’s it for the funniest ending 
(IMHO).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #12: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
            - After getting the Epoch, with wings, go to the end of time 
              and use the bucket. It doesn’t matter if you have Magus or
              not. But, Crono must be dead.

Marle and Lucca will wake up at the end of time, except that the others are 
still asleep. After regaining control of the 2, talk to Gaspar. Now, speak to 
everyone and they’ll refuse to help you find Crono. They will go to their 
respective portals and so does Marle and Lucca. The 2 will then be back at 
Leene’s Square. After regaining control of your characters, go to Lucca’s 
Device. After a short dialogue between the 2, the gate will open and all your 
other party members will appear, including Gaspar. Your party members do care 
about Crono and they badly want the Time Egg (Chrono Trigger) from Gaspar. If 
you killed Magus, Frog will be in the form of Glenn. Lucca will be amazed by 
Glenn’s looks! After that, a soldier will come in and asks for Marle. Go south 
and talk to King Guardia. He will present to you, Nadia’s Bell. After the King 
puts up the Bell, Marle and Lucca goes off to the Epoch. Then, Taban will come 
in and shows a dazzling display of fireworks. After that, the credits will be 
shown. You’ll see the Epoch take off. In the next scenes, you’ll see Marle and 
Lucca visit their friends. Robo and his girlfriend (Atropos) on top of a 
mountain. Ayla and Kino riding Dactyls. Frog, King Guardia XXI and Queen Leene 
at the castle. If you killed Magus, you’ll see Glenn. After some credits, 
you’ll see Marle beside a tree. FYI, it’s on Death Peak. Then, you’ll see a 
shadow of Crono and Marle will run after it. The End.

Variations:
- If you killed Magus, Frog will be in his original form, Glenn.
- If you weren’t able to punch in L.A.R.A. at Lucca’s House where you must
  save Lucca’s mom from the machine, Lucca’s Mom will be sitting instead of 
  standing.
- If you fought Lavos by using the Epoch to go to 1999 AD, Marle will
  fly off with balloons. If you didn’t, that is the time the cats will
  go to the Time Gate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #13: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
            - Simply lose to Lavos when you fight him ANYWHERE/ANYTIME.

Lavos erupts from the ground as we see him do on the monitor in the future. 
Next, we’ll see three men standing around a computer screen, see things like 
"he's come". The year is 1999. The director  (one of the men) asks for a 
damage report and a map of the world appears with several red spots spreading 
across it. One of the men then says, "Truce, Porre, Medina-all destroyed". 
Then, as rocks start falling from the roof the other men try to pull the 
director out of the complex. When he won't move the others flee anyway leaving 
the director to mutter "Lavos" under his breath as some rocks crush him to 
death. Fade to black. The, a world globe with these words written over it: 
But...the future refused to change.

This is contributed by: Happy Smurf (Tristan)! Thanks a lot! 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ending #14: You can trigger this ending by the following condition:
            - Lose to Magic when you fight him for the first time.

This isn’t actually an ending because you lost. But then, it’s very 
interesting. After your defeat, Magus will turn his back on your party. It’s 
assumed that Magus will finally be able to summon Lavos. Then, you’ll hear 
Lavos howl then the screen will fade to black.

This is contributed by: ~dry31~! Thanks man! I never expected yet another 
ending.

Thanks to Ben Struble (tron916@hotmail.com) for most of the info about the 
sealed chests/doors contents.

If you have seen a Sealed chest or door, please e-mail it to me so that I can 
put it up. 

Here’s a Tip. If you find a sealed chest in 600 AD. Examine it first but don’t 
get it. Then, head to 1000 AD to get the more powerful versions of the 
equipments/items. Then, head back to 600 AD to get the original item. 2 Items 
in 1 chest. Very neat! (thanks again to ~The Silent One~ for the info)

     You may be wondering why I didn’t put up the prices. It is because
     the prices here are at random. Remember that the Mystics here hate
     humans so they will set a VERY UNFAIR price at random. Sometimes, 
     you’ll get a Tonic for 500G! and sometimes it will reach up to
     2000+G! If you have a lot of money, and I do mean a lot, buy them as
     the equipments here are quite good.

                          NEW GAME+ INFORMATION
                      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

In Chrono Trigger, there is what you call the New Game+ Mode. When you beat 
the game and completed all the side quests (the seven people/places Gaspar 
told you before going to Lavos). There are also speculations that, all you 
have to do is to get all the characters in the game, including Magus, to join 
your party. Please let me know what happened to your game. Tell me if you 
tried not to complete the side quests and got the New Game+ Mode.

About the New Game+ Mode. After you beat a game (defeated the final form of 
Lavos), when you return to the title screen and pressed Start or A button, you 
can select a saved game or start a new one right? Well, now, there is a new 
option on top, which is the New Game+. When you select the New Game+ mode, 
you’ll begin again in the game, but, all your experience, items, equipments 
will be just the same as you beat the previous game. This will make the next 
game easier. Also, not all items and equipments will be restored. The items 
and equipments that are considered vital to the story will disappear. Example, 
the Masamune Blade, Bike Key, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Where can I find this Walkthrough/FAQ?

   This walkthrough/FAQ will be updated and posted mainly at 
http://WWW.GAMEFAQS.COM. You can also see an updated copy of this walkthrough 
on the following site/s. Note that I gave permission to the sites below so 
that they can publish my work in its original and unaltered form.

2. I have the Chrono Trigger and I’ve got a clone of Crono and I want to  
revive him. I talked to Gaspar (Guru of Time) many times but the Nu in the 
Keeper’s Dome kept on telling me the instructions on how to use the Epoch. He 
doesn’t give any information regarding the Death Peak so that I can revive 
Crono. How will I make the Nu talk about Death Peak and finally revive Crono?

If there is an Epoch in the Keeper's Dome at this point in the game, you're 
screwed--you've managed to accidentally trigger one of the few 
story-affecting bugs in the game. What triggers this bug is leaving the Epoch 
inside the Keeper's Dome before going to the Ocean Palace. After the Ocean 
Palace is destroyed, the Epoch gets moved to the island where the survivors of 
Zeal are. But if the Epoch was previously in the Keeper's Dome, it also 
remains there, resulting in *two Epochs*. The presence of the (duplicate) 
Epoch inside the Dome prevents the Nu from doing what it's supposed to do, and 
you can't revive Crono at all.

MAJOR credit goes to CDXTER2000@AOL.COM for giving me this info. It will 
surely inform others about this unusual bug.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How often can you update the FAQ?

This is the question, which do not have an exact answer. An update will be 
made if there are certain infos that need to be included. Like the side quests 
and updates of various sections of this walkthrough/FAQ like the Weapons, 
Helmets, Armors, etc. I’m still going to school and I only have limited time 
per day to make updates/revisions of this walkthrough. But, I’ll always make 
sure that if there’s a new info, I’ll update this walkthrough/FAQ right away.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. In my first visit to the End of Time, Spekkio told me to run around the 
room clockwise 3 times. I did it but nothing happens?

Here’s what you should do, Start from the door and start walking, don’t run, 
AROUND the room clockwise 3 times. While you’re walking, stay as close as 
possible to the walls. Then, talk to Spekkio. He will then start to teach you 
magic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. In the Death Peak, I can’t use the Poyozo Doll to pass through the strong 
winds. When I it turned into a tree I stayed behind it and the wind still blew 
me away. How can I pass through then?

First, make sure there’s a Poyozo Doll on the way (If you don’t see the Poyozo 
Doll, go back to Keeper’s Dome again and make sure it is the quest to bring 
back Crono). Now, when you reach the Poyozo Doll, it will turn into a tree, 
stay exactly in the middle of it and I kept on RUNNING towards the tree when 
the wind is strong and it won’t blow you away and you will be able to go to 
the next tree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. How many endings does this game really have?

All in all, 12. In ending no. 2. It is revealed there that there are 10 
endings to the game. But, I’ve seen 12 as of now. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. How do I get Magus to join my party?

There is only one chance for you in order to have Magus in your party. After 
you beat Dalton Plus in the Blackbird 12,000 AD, you’ll be brought to the 
Commons right? Then, exit the Commons. In the world map, head northwest and 
enter the North Cape. You’ll see Magus at the peak. Eventually you’ll be asked 
if you wish to fight him or not. If you want to fight him, you’ll get all his 
equipments and the EXP and G but you won’t be able to have him join your 
party, because he’s already dead. If you didn’t fight him, he will voluntarily 
join your party. If you miss this one, you can’t get Magus anymore. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Where is the best place to Level up my characters?

Go to the Black Omen anytime before 1999 AD. When you reach the first save 
point, you’ll fight with 3 enemies. 2 Synchrites and a Martello. After beating 
them, go to the next area then come back again to fight another batch of those 
3 enemies. You’ll receive the following after each battle: 2450 EXP, 34 TP, 
and a HyperEther. It is the best known way to level up fast.

If you want to acquire lots of money, sell off those HyperEthers for a 
whopping 5,000 Gs each!

Thanks again to Brandon Boucher (TheDOORS66@aol.com) for this info. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. How can you get the New Game+ Mode?

Most of you think that you have to complete all the side quests. But to get 
New Game+ Mode, you only have to have Magus in your party and Crono is alive. 
In short, everyone possible character is alive. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. If having trouble with the L+R then A button sequence at Arris Dome, can 
you help me out?

This is a common problem. For emulator users, here’s an explanation. Some 
keyboards cannot scan or read 3 keys that are pressed at the same time and 
that makes it impossible to move on. All you have to do is to create a key 
that is the equivalent of the 3. Example, Set the keys L,R,A into one button, 
let’s say you use the spacebar. So, when you press the spacebar, L+R+A will be 
executed and you can move on inside Arris Dome.

Now, on the SNES, Stand in front of the console, press and hold the L and R 
and then press the A button. You should be able to access the right door now. 
But in order to do this, make sure you talked to the rat before hand or else 
the code for the console will not work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What Level should my characters be so that at least it can already beat 
Lavos?

I think, the least level of your characters should at around 40. You can 
surely beat Lavos, but of course, you also need some strategy. Recommended 
Level? It’s 60 and above! You can beat Lavos anytime, anywhere. 

NOTE: I forgot the e-mail senders for this FAQ. Please e-mail me again so I 
can mention you in this guide.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Please tell me more about the emulation of this game?

Ok, I have received A LOT of e-mails regarding Emulation of the game already. 
Now, everybody listen. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE A ROM OF A GAME, IF AND 
ONLY IF, YOU HAVE THE SYSTEM (SNES) AND THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL GAME CARTRIDGE. 
YOU ONLY HAVE 24 HOURS TO USE IT, AFTER THAT YOU MUST DELETE IT. Of course, I 
understand that one is legally entitled to have a copy of what he owns (which 
must be legal also) for emergency purposes. Example, you have a copy of a 
certain game and you don’t have a copy of it. What if, your system breaks 
down, or the cartridge fails? Of course your only resort is to look for a 
copy. Got my point?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What will you do next and what do you plan to include on your next update?

As always, I’ll accept any e-mail regarding Chrono Trigger. I’ll continue on 
updating whenever new info comes along or if there are corrections to be made. 
Just keep those e-mails coming. Thanks to all of you who sent their e-mails to 
me. 

Take note also that I’m currently updating my new project. A comprehensive 
Walkthrough/FAQ for the sequel to this game, Chrono Cross.

                              GAMEPLAY TIPS
                          =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1. Whenever you pass by the Guardia Forest in 600 AD, always examine the 
moving bush with a Kilwala to receive a free Shelter every time you visit 
there. 

2. When you see a Save Point, Save your game always. You’ll never know 
when/where the next save point will be. If your HP/MP is low, about 10% left, 
don’t hesitate to use a Shelter.

3. When you’re in a new town/village, take time to buy the new 
weapons/armors/helmets that are sold. Each new/stronger weapon will guarantee 
an easier adventure. 

4. When you encounter a new enemy, check it’s elemental affinity. Then attack 
it with the opposite of it’s elemental. It will make the battle shorter and 
easier. 

5. Whenever you are in 65,000,000 BC, always use Lightning Magic first as they 
will significantly lower the defense of Dinosaurs. 

6. If you have Ayla and her Charm ability, try to charm each new opponent you 
face. Whether it’s a boss or not, you may never know what will come to you.

7. For easy racing against Johnny at Lab 32, Change your perspective. Press 
the L or the R button to rotate the screen. You can easily stay in front of 
him if your view is from the front. 

8. Here’s a tip regarding Tabs. Whenever you start a New Game+, when you reach 
the End of Time for the first time, beat Spekkio. You’ll receive his set of 
tabs right? Now, after getting the tabs, start another New Game+ using your 
previous save and repeat the process. It’s tedious but rewarding.

                                OTHER STUFF
                         -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-        

This is mainly to ease the seriousness of the gamers in playing the game. We 
know that some people play games seriously (like me, sometimes), that they do 
not sleep just to see what happens next and what should they do to get this or 
that. I wanted to add these so that we can also get a different perspective of 
the game, it is not only a game wherein you buy the game then finish it then 
dump it. It has lots of things to discover. We can learn from them, 
specifically the Words of Wisdom, and we can apply some of them in our lives. 
Gaming also means, to have fun and we should be happy every time we’re 
playing, that’s why Square included some funny scenes in the game to make you 
laugh and enjoy more. Not just play and finish, as stated above. As for the 
screw ups, these are just minor mistakes in the game such as spellings, 
graphics, etc. But, I’d like to point out that this is not intended to hurt 
others’ feelings just because they made a mistake. It’s only for fun. 

Note: Of course I will continue updating the guide as long that there is an 
update/revision/correction needed. I’m saying this because some of you might 
think I’d abandon the guide itself due to these stuff.

                              WORDS OF WISDOM

This section contains different statements, which are excerpts from the game. 
The statements that will be included here are those that you can learn a 
lesson from, those that we can apply in our lives, and those that touch the 
hearts of the gamers out there. Also includes simple, yet interesting 
statements.

1. Trann Dome (2300 AD) - Man who sells items
   “Save Money. It’ll do ya good. That’s my motto.”

2. Trann Dome (2300 AD) - man who is panting
   “Amazing what you can do when you think you’re gonna expire..”

3. Commons (12,000 BC) - Woman beside the plant
   “This mysterious sapling...maybe someday it will help change
   our environment?!”

4. Cathedral (600 AD) - Nun at the altar
   “In our world, Every storm has an end. Every night brings a new morning.
   What’s important is to trust those you love, and never give up...We must
   Keep all hope alive...”

5. Residence: Truce Village (600 AD) - man sitting on a chair
   “Let’s wage peace from now on!”

6. Enhasa - Book behind secret door
   “The Mystery of Life”
   Vol. 841, Ch. 26
   All life begins with Nu and ends with Nu...
   This is the truth!
   This is my belief!
   ...at least for now.

7. The End of Time - Gaspar
   “Fail to live up to your potential, and you will never win...”

8. Commons (12,000 BC) – One of the Enlightened ones (before BlackBird)
   “You’re absolutely right! We’re alive, and there’s always hope.”

9. Commons (12,000 BC) – One of the Earthbounds (before Blackbird)
   “Gotta seize the day!”

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

                              SCENES OF HUMOR

This section particularly focuses on scenes that make you laugh and ease your 
seriousness in the game.

1. Whenever Ayla does her “surprise” action (the action which you mimic back 
at Norstein Bekkler’s Lab), notice that she doesn’t have any underwear!!! 

2. In Ozzie’s Fort, when he pulled the lever to call 2 Goblins, they fell on 
conveyors belts that killed them. The music sounded funny afterwards. 

3. At Leene’s Square there’s something funny in the Ring the Bell mini-game. 
Imagine bumping your whole body. Just a little hammer would do. :) 

4. After the completion of the Aero-Dalton Imperial, Crono’s Music will be 
played. Dalton will be pissed!

5. In the best ending of the game. Robo cried Oil! That’s the reason why he 
bumped into the device of Lucca. 

6. When Ayla sees Frog, she will think that he is a snack. When Frog starts to 
ask about the whereabouts of Magus, Ayla will ask if that person is more 
tasty!

7. During the battle against Flea for the first time, observe the reaction of 
the party right after they learn that Flea is indeed, a man.

8. At Giant’s Claw, when you reach the familiar room that is in fact the 
Tyrano Lair, try to sit on the empty chair. Your characters will start to 
laugh. :)

                                SCREWED UP

This section, contains screw ups or mistakes found in Chrono Trigger. This 
section is not intended to hurt the feelings of the developers. Again, it is 
just for fun.

1. On the box, you’ll notice that Marle used Fire Magic with Crono. Remember, 
Marle’s Element is Ice and only Lucca and Magus can use Fire Magic. (Thanks to 
Brandon Boucher for this info) 

2. The Epoch Bug. Check FAQ #9 for the details.

3. When you return to Guardia Castle 600 AD, when you talk to the King, he’ll 
thank you for defeating Magus. If you bring Magus with you, he’ll say the same 
thing! “MAGUS IS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU DUMB@$$ KING!!” (Thanks to 
Kevin for this info.)

4. As in #3, a similar thing will happen if you talk to Cyrus in the Northern 
Ruins 600 AD with Magus in your party.

5. In the SUNKEN DESERT, ROBO volunteered to stay right. After I got Chrono 
back from Fiona's shrine, I went back to 600 AD and saw a ROBO working. I went 
to Fiona's house and I had Robo in front of me and she said the same thing 
even when Robo is in front of me and the fact also that there are 2 robos in 
this time period.

6. After beating Yakra for the first time, the Chancellor is inside the 
treasure chest right? Now, if you didn’t set him free, he’ll jump out of the 
chest on his own. Now why didn’t he do that in the first place?

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
