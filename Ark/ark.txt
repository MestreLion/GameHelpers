WEAPONRY
--------

Tranquilizer Arrows deal less damage than regular Stone Arrows
Crossbow works underwater and is a great mid-game general-purpose weapon

FARMING
-------
All plot sizes wield the *same* amount at the same rate
Difference is only water capacity, and seed requirements: Vegs need medium, Plant X turret need large
Maxed out cops (300 berries, 150 vegs) consume substantially less Fertilizer
3x3 Greenhouse enough for 300%: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SdI2Piau0c
	Only Wall, Ceiling and Sloped Roof count
	Faster growth, same Fertilizer consumption, but indirectly less as it maxes out faster.
