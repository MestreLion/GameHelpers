1. Revision History
	0.1	First version. Based on location test version in the arcade.
	0.2	Revised for the PSX version.
	

2. What is Dance Dance Revoltion?
Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is the game that started the dance game craze in
Japan/Asia. Konami has created this simple to learn, fun game. The game is played
using your feet. If you have played other Bemani games, just think of it as
Beatmania played by stepping on arrows instead of hitting the notes. The screen
shows 4 directional arrows that you must step on when it overlaps at the top of
the screen. At the time of this writing, 4th Mix is the latest version.


3. System
The system has been changed drastically. The song selection, step selection, mode
selection process is totally different from previous versions. The most important
change is the fact that Dance Dance Revolution Solo has been added into the DDR
series.

For those of you that do not know, DDR Solo uses 6 panels instead of 4, and is
1 player (ie. Solo) game. So it cannot be played versus, battle, or double.

At the beginning you choose DDR or DDR Solo. Next when you press Start, you'll get
a menu. If you chose DDR, this is what you would have gotten if you had pressed
LEFT and RIGHT triangle buttons and pressed start in 2nd or 3rd Mix.

DDR: SINGLE, VERSUS, DOUBLE
SOLO: 4 PANELS, 6 PANELS

Next, you get to choose a genre. You cannot change a genre during the game. Possible
genres are as follows. The character you play as is picked here.

Group 1
Konami Original
Veriety
Pops
Calorie Burner
Fun Factor
Special Selection
Group 2

Next is music selection. These songs will be from the genre you
have selected.

After choosing your song, it is time to select your step. This is where you
pick Basic, Trick or Maniac. Please note that now all songs have Maniac Double
Also from here you decide your play style. Press select to open up a menu.
  Off <-> Little <-> Flat
    Little: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 steps are removed.
    Flat: All arrows have same color.

8. Conclusion
This is my second FAQ. My first FAQ was for DDR 3rd Mix for the PSX.
As I start writing this, the game has just begun location testing in Japan.
Hopefully, Konami will get it through to their heads that this game can
become successful in the States and import 4th Mix right away with a huge
promotion. I will continue to update this FAQ with everybody's contribution,
and reports from various BBS'es around the world, including Japan and Korea.
But, there is so much I can do without actually playing the game myself...
so this FAQ will never become really complete, I'm afraid. If anyone that
has access to an actual arcade machine, wants to co-author this FAQ, I'd be
very grateful.

I wanted to give something back to the gaming community as I have enjoyed many,
many FAQs written by countless others that share the information that they have
gathered/discovered, at no cost to us.

You may e-mail me with your comments, information at the address at the top
of this FAQ.
