Introduction
------------
Despite being one of the more integral parts of the game, the exact workings of 
the population system in Actraiser have always remained mysterious.  A player 
could complete this game numerous times and notice differences in the 
population totals for some or all regions in each play through.  Most sources 
never discuss this topic beyond general tips and build strategies, and no 
source has ever quantified the maximum population or explained how that total 
is attainable.

This guide is the first to explore this topic in detail, including discussion 
of the maximum populations in each region and all the specific factors that 
influence this number.  Everything from the impact of game score, item use, map 
size, building types, number of structures, and even the direction of roads 
will be analyzed, as all of these affect population.  Whether you are a first-
time player or an Actraiser veteran, you will likely learn something new about 
this game that will help make your future adventures more interesting.

==============================================================================

Population in Actraiser is one of the game's integral mechanics as you attempt 
to rebuild the barren world.  It is the determining factor for your character's 
level, hit points, and spell points.  While it is not necessary to achieve the 
absolute maximum population to reach the highest level (level 17 at 4,600 
people), you will need to come relatively close in most regions to have a 
chance.  Each region has a maximum population that can be attained under ideal 
circumstances, as shown below.


   Region            Max Population
   ======            ==============
   Fillmore               914
   Bloodpool              874
   Kasandora              874
   Aitos                  802
   Marahna                538
   Northwall              650
   ---------             -----
   TOTAL                 4,652


The maximum global population in the game is 4,652.  This allows you some 
leeway in reaching level 17 (52 people to be exact).  If you have fallen short 
of 4,652, the likely culprits are shortfalls in Fillmore or Bloodpool.  A few 
tips mentioned below should allow you to reach the maximum with a little work 
(see "Factors Limiting Population").  


==============================================================================
2.  G E N E R A L   T I P S   F O R   M A X I M I Z A T I O N             AR04
==============================================================================

The tips below will help you maximize populations in most regions.  See the 
following sections for specific details on understanding how and why population 
growth occurs, as well as how to maximize populations in each specific region.


1. DESTROY LEVEL 1 AND 2 HOUSES
In all stages, houses begin holding more people as the civilization level 
increases.  Once you reach level 3, destroy all the existing level 1 and 2 
houses.  This will need to be done using Lightning early on, but Earthquakes 
work much more effectively later in the game, as they leave level 3 buildings 
intact and affect the entire map with one use.

2. REPLACE CORN FIELDS WITH WHEAT FIELDS
In Kasandora and Marahna, you will need to replace corn fields with wheat 
fields to achieve the maximum population.  Wheat fields provide resources to a 
larger number of people than corn fields do, so fewer of these structures are 
required.  This indirectly allows more housing structures to be created.  You 
do not need to worry about replacing corn fields with wheat in Fillmore or 
Northwall, as fields are eventually replaced by factories (the large, purple-
roofed buildings).

3. RUN UP THE SCORE DURING THE ACTION STAGES
Unknown to most people, your score in the action stages directly affects your 
maximum population.  The higher your score, the greater the number of "souls" 
that are freed.  These souls later become the people who inhabit each region.  
The exact cumulative (Act 1 + Act 2) score that you need varies in each level, 
but it is between 16,300 and 27,100 (see the "Factors Limiting Population" 
section for specific point totals).

4. MINIMIZE BRIDGES
There has been a long-standing myth that the number of bridges affect the 
maximum population in each region.  As it turns out, this myth is correct.  
However, it's not the bridges in themselves that limit population -- each 
region is restricted to 128 total structures, and bridges count towards that 
total. Bridges become a major limiting factor in Fillmore and Bloodpool.  You 
will need to be creative with build orders to minimize the number of bridges 
yet still build over each square of the map.  For reference, Fillmore's 
population is maximized with 2 (or fewer) bridges and Bloodpool's population is 
maximized with 3 bridges.  You do not have to worry about the number of bridges 
in Marahna or Northwall.

5. COVER THE MAP
It is important to make sure every inhabitable square is covered.  Some 
regions, like Bloodpool and Aitos, have a few squares near the borders of the 
map that are easy to overlook.  While they may only hold a couple of houses, 
every structure is important.  You will not be able to maximize population in 
any region except Kasandora if every inhabitable square is not built out.



==============================================================================
3.  T H E   S O U L   C O U N T E R                                       AR05
==============================================================================

According to Actraiser's backstory, Tanzra (the Evil One) transformed the 
inhabitants of the world into demons after he defeated the Master and forced 
him to retreat into his Sky Palace to recover.  Your main role in the game is 
to free these lost souls so that civilization can flourish again.  This is done 
by defeating as many demons as possible, both in the action and simulation 
portions of the game.

As you defeat demons and free the souls of the lost people, the game keeps 
track of this in a hidden statistic called the "soul counter," which records 
the number of "freed souls" in each region.  Freed souls ultimately become the 
people who end up populating new houses when the town expands.  


==========================
HOW THE SOUL COUNTER WORKS
==========================
The soul counter for each new region begins at zero.  So long as it is zero, 
you cannot begin building the town.  You will notice this every time you enter 
a new area.  During simulation mode, you can free souls in two ways:

   1. Defeat enemies with the angel's arrows or Bomb (1 soul)
   2. Seal a monster lair (souls = number of monsters in lair) 

Each time a soul is freed, whether from a defeated enemy or sealed lair, you 
will see a small, white "cloud" head to the temple.  This signifies an addition 
to the soul counter.  The soul counter is then decreased once the town is 
expanded and the population increases (as these people are no longer souls, but 
now living beings).

The easiest way to increase the soul counter, and thus grow your population, is 
by sealing monster lairs.  You can see the number of trapped souls in a monster 
lair by hovering over it and pressing the B button.  You will receive a message 
that says something like "There seems to be 172 Napper Bats in this Lair."  In 
this case, 172 is the number of trapped souls.  If this lair is sealed, the 
soul counter (and potential population) will increase by 172.

At the outset of each region, you will need to defeat at least a few monsters 
with the angel so that the town can be built out far enough to reach the first 
lair.  You will also need a population of at least 10 to seal a monster lair.

If your people are killed, whether by monsters or by you, the souls of these 
dead townsfolk will be added to the trapped souls in the monster lairs.  If a 
monster kills the townsfolk, those souls will return to the lair of that 
particular monster.  If you kill the townsfolk, the souls will be divided 
evenly across the remaining monster lairs.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|EXAMPLE                                                                     |
|Let's say there is one Napper Bat lair (with 100 enemies) and one Blue      |
|Demon lair (with 50 enemies) remaining.  Below is a table showing what      |
|happens to the enemy count in each lair when your people are killed.  In    |
|the first case, the Blue Demon uses its lighting attack to kill 8 people.   |
|In the second case, you use lightning to kill 8 people.                     |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|                 Enemies in Lair      Enemies in Lair       Enemies in Lair |
| Enemy Lair        (starting)       (Blue Demon kills 8)     (you kill 8)   |
| ==========      ==============     ====================    =============== |
| Napper Bat           100                   100                   104       |
| Blue Demon            50                    58                    54       |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

If all monster lairs have already been sealed, the souls of slain townspeople 
will simply be added back to the soul counter.


===================================
HOW SOULS AFFECT MAXIMUM POPULATION
===================================
Something that should start becoming apparent now is the relationship between 
enemies in monster lairs, the soul counter, and the maximum population in a 
region.  The maximum population during Act 1 of the simulation mode cannot be 
higher than the number of starting monsters in all four lairs.  The following 
equation always holds true:

  Maximum Population = Population + Soul Counter + Enemies in Monster Lairs

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|EXAMPLE                                                                     |
|You begin a region with a population of 2.  You have not killed any enemies |
|yet, so the soul counter is 0.  You add the number of enemies in all four   |
|lairs and calculate 600.  Therefore, the maximum population you can reach   |
|during Act 1 is 602:                                                        |
|                                                                            |
|  602 = 2 (population) + 0 (soul counter) + 600 (enemies in monster lairs) |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Note that there are still other factors that may limit population even if you 
have ample souls for growth.  These will be discussed in later sections of this 
guide.

You may be wondering a couple of things based on your past experience:

   1. Why is the number of enemies in monster lairs always different?
   2. How does the city keep growing after Act 2, even after all the monster
      lairs have been sealed?

The answer to both of these has to do with the amount of points you score 
during the two action segments of the stage.


===================================
HOW SCORE AFFECTS SOULS AND ENEMIES
===================================
The number of points you score during the action stages affects both the number 
of starting enemies in monster lairs (during Act 1) and the soul counter 
directly (during Act 2).

When you begin a new region, there is a starting number of enemies that will 
always be in each monster lair regardless of the how many points you score 
during the action segment (the exact totals are in the "Factors Limiting 
Population" section).  This total will be then be increased by 1 enemy for 
every 50 points you earn during the action stage.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|EXAMPLE 1                                                                   |
|Fillmore will always begin with a minimum of 500 cumulative enemies in the  |
|monster lairs, regardless of score.  Let's say you score 9,600 points       |
|during the action portion of Act 1.  You will add 9,600/50 or 192 enemies   |
|to the monster lairs.  This amount is spread evenly across the lairs, so    |
|each lair would add 192/4 or 48 new enemies.  Therefore, the new total      |
|number of souls in the region will be 694 (enemies plus 2 for the founders  |
|This is now the highest population you can achieve during Act 1 of the      |
|simulation.                                                                 |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

In the event that your score is not evenly divisible by 50, round down to get 
to the number of additional enemies.

Score has a similar effect during the Act 2 action stage.  However, since all 
the monster lairs will be sealed, the additional souls are added directly to 
the soul counter.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|EXAMPLE 2                                                                   |
|Continuing from example 1, let's say the player was able to reach a         |
|population of 694 in Act 1.  Population growth stopped since there were not |
|enough souls left to continue growing the town.  During Act 2, the player   |
|scores 10,000 points.  This would add 10,000/50 or 200 new souls directly   |
|to the soul counter.  Once the act resumed, you could continue building     |
|until you either ran out of souls (at population 694+200 or 894) or reached |
|some other limiting factor of the region.                                   |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The table below summarizes the impact of score on souls:


   Stage                 Impact of Score
   =====                 ===============
   Act 1 action          Each 50 points adds 1 enemy to an enemy lair
   Act 2 action          Each 50 points adds 1 soul to the soul counter


Given its relationship to the soul counter, the number of points you score 
during the action stages can actually limit the maximum population of each 
region.  Therefore, there is a minimum number of points that you should try to 
score during Acts 1 and 2 to maximize population.  A breakdown of these point 
totals can be found in the "Factors Limiting Population" section.

==============================================================================

In order to understand how population grows (and peaks), it is important to 
understand the different structures and their impact on how a town is 
constructed.  Also, several in-game events will have an affect on growth rate, 
and these are discussed below.


==================
HOUSING STRUCTURES
==================
Housing structures are the basic buildings that your denizens will occupy.  
Each stage has three different types of housing depending on the current 
civilization level.  Civilization level increases when certain monster lairs 
are sealed, and the game will let you know when this happens.

The housing structures at different civilization levels have different 
appearances and hold a different number of people.


   Civilization       Type of                  Number of
      Level           Housing                   People  
   ============       =======                  =========
        1             Mud Huts                    4
        2             Log Cabins/Tents            6
        3             Brick/Stone Houses          8


Each region has slightly different housing after level 1 to match the geography 
of that area.  However, this has no effect on the number of people these 
buildings can hold.

Once you reach civilization level 3, you will want to go back and destroy older 
level 1 and level 2 buildings (the easiest way to do this is via an 
Earthquake).  This will allow you to fit more people into the same space and 
helps you reach the maximum population.


=====================
SUPPORTING STRUCTURES
=====================
While most people ignore their existence, each area requires supporting 
structures capable of providing food or resources to sustain the population.  
These are the non-populous buildings like fields, windmills, and even factories 
(large, purple-roofed buildings) that are automatically constructed along with 
houses.  Below is a list of each structure, along with how many people each 
will support.


   Supporting         Number of          Civ
   Structure       People Supported     Level     Region
   =========       ================     =====     ======
   Bridge                 32             N/A      All but Aitos and Kasandora
   Corn Field             32             1-3      All but Aitos
   Horse Ranch            32              1       Aitos
   Wheat Field            48             1-3      All but Aitos
   Factory                72            3;2-3     Fillmore and Northwall
   Windmill               72             2-3      Aitos


Two of these structures will not be created until you reach civilization levels 
2 or 3 (windmill and factory).  These structures, along with wheat fields and 
bridges, cannot be destroyed by earthquakes.  Bridges cannot be destroyed by 
anything and are permanent once built.

The "Number of People Supported" column indicates that how many people the 
structure provides resources for.  There must be adequate resources already 
available before the population can expand.

A supporting structure will often be the first building created to ensure 
adequate resources for the new population.  If, however, the first square you 
build to cannot physically be occupied by a supporting structure, one will be 
created as soon as possible.  Similarly, if you intentionally destroy the 
supporting structures but leave the houses intact, the game will rebuild all of 
them before adding any new houses and growing the population.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|EXAMPLE                                                                     |
|You have a town with 60 people and 2 corn fields (the two corn fields       |
|support 32*2 or 64 people).  The town expands to 68 people.  During this    |
|expansion, you will also see an additional corn field being created, as one |
|is required for every 32 people.  Supporting structures will always be      |
|created in advance of houses to make sure enough resources are provided in  |
|advance.                                                                    |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The different regions have different supporting structures.  Since some 
supporting structures provide more resources than others, some regions will 
have fewer structures than others at the same population total.  This is 
important to keep in mind, as the number of total structures is a limiting 
factor of maximum population (see "Factors Limiting Population" for more).

The resources provided also give a rationale for replacing corn fields with 
wheat fields when you can: wheat will support more houses.  You will need to 
replace corn fields with wheat fields in both Kasandora and Marahna to reach 
the maximum population.  You do not need to do this in Fillmore or Northwall, 
as the final supporting structure (factory) can replace the fields.

The stand-out structure on the above list is the bridge. Unlike the other 
structures, you do have some control over the creation of bridges based on the 
direction you expand the town.  If a bridge exists, fewer of other types of 
supporting structures will have to be built to support the people.  However, 
bridges provide the least amount of resources of any supporting structure.  In 
stages where your population is limited by the physical number of structures 
(Fillmore and Bloodpool), you will want to minimize bridges and instead create 
more supporting structures of other types to allow for more houses.  For some 
strategies on how to minimize bridges in both regions, see the "Maximizing 
Population in Each Region" section below.


===================
INHABITABLE SQUARES
===================
One of the factors that limits maximum population is the physical amount of 
space in which housing units can be constructed.  While it may seem like there 
is additional space for expansion in some regions that stop growing, you need 
to consider that houses can only be placed in certain orientations.

Each region is made up of 64 squares (8 by 8).  You can see the square by 
selecting the lightning (or similar miracle) or by choosing a direction to 
build the town.  Both of these will highlight one of the 64 squares with a 
yellow box.  Within each square, either housing structures, supporting 
structures, or roads can be placed.  These are restricted to designated spots 
within the square, and are also limited by natural terrain (like a river or 
mountain).

Within each square, structures will always be built as indicated by the image 
below.  H = housing structures, S = supporting structures, and = designates 
roads.

      -------------------
     |SSSS|SSSS|====|HHHH|
     |SSSS|SSSS|====|HHHH|
     |----|----|----|----|
     |SSSS|SSSS|====|HHHH|
     |SSSS|SSSS|====|HHHH|
     |----|----|----|----|
     |====|====|====|====|
     |====|====|====|====|
     |----|----|----|----|
     |HHHH|HHHH|====|HHHH|
     |HHHH|HHHH|====|HHHH|
      ------------------- 

Within each square, no more than 5 housing units can ever be created.  
Supporting units will always appear at the top-left corner, and roads will 
separate the two.  Even if roads or supporting structures do not exist on a 
particular square, housing can never be built on any part of the square where a 
supporting structure or road *could* exist.

This construction pattern debunks some of the older tips for this game that 
told you to delete excess fields and supporting structures to make more space 
for houses.


==================
DIRECTION OF ROADS
==================
Roads within each square can run north-south or east-west.  Roads will 
typically follow your building direction.  For example, if you order the town 
to be built three units upward from the temple, roads will only appear north-
south.  Also, if you select a building direction and do not move to any 
different squares (just press B and remain on the current square), roads will 
typically be filled out in the square for both directions.  This is how you can 
get N-S and E-W roads on squares in the corner of the screen that can only 
be approached from one direction.

Road direction is important when it comes to regions where bridges are built 
(particularly Fillmore and Bloodpool).  You can minimize the bridges built by 
ordering the building direction to run strictly parallel to rivers, rather than 
perpendicular (or right at them).  If the roads are built perpendicularly, 
bridges will automatically be constructed once you build on the other side of 
the river.

|The image below shows 9 squares with a river (river indicated by ~) that    |
|divides squares 1-3 and 5-7 (similar to the river in Fillmore).  If you     |
|command the build direction to go from 1-7, sequentially, only one bridge   |
|will be built (in square 5).  If you build or enter squares 1, 2, 6, or 7   |
|from the east or west, the game will build another one or two bridges over  |
|the river.  This area can have as few as one bridge or as many as three.    |

======================
"PHANTOM" CONSTRUCTION
======================
One of the odder occurrences in the game is when a town's population 
mysteriously grows in regions when you are not there.  This is referred to as 
"phantom construction" and occurs in Fillmore, Aitos, and Northwall.  Phantom 
construction happens when regions have a square that is capable of holding a 
house but is partially obstructed on one or more sides.  These houses are not 
built because the game's pathing rules for townspeople forbid them from passing 
through other objects on their way to build a structure.  However, the game is 
still programmed to build on all portions of a square that are free, so there 
is a conflict.  This produces phantom construction of new houses while you are 
in another region.

A couple of oddities concerning phantom construction:

   1. When you enter a different region from the one where the phantom
      buildings will be constructed, you must wait for the hour glass to empty
      and fill three times.  After the third time, the global population will
      increase and the new buildings will be placed.

   2. Phantom construction will only occur after Act 2 has been completed.

You will need to make use of phantom construction in Fillmore and Aitos to 
reach the maximum population.  In Fillmore, this phantom house is constructed 
either one square left and one square up from the temple (just underneath the 
corner of the river) or the square one left from that (just underneath the 
riverbend).  In Aitos, there are three phantom houses built in each of the 
inhabitable squares along the bottom of the screen.  You can also use this 
technique in Northwall to build a house in the bottom-left corner of the square 
directly below the temple when no bridge or road exist.


=================
POPULATION STATUS
=================
While you are building, different events and occurrences will affect the 
population status as indicated on the Status of Cities screen.

NONE           This is the status in regions that you cannot enter yet.  This
               will change once you complete Act 1.

NORM           Indicates that all the proper factors are in place for
               population growth to continue.

SLOW           Population status is listed as Slow when the soul counter runs
               low OR when you have reached the maximum population during
               Act 1.  Even if this population is the highest that can later
               be attained in Act 2, the status will still be Slow instead of
               Max.

STOP           There are a few instances in the game where events will unfold
               that require your intervention before the city can continue to
               grow.  See the next subsection for a complete list of these
               events.  You must remedy these problems before continuing to
               build the city.

MAX            Max means that you have reached the maximum population *given*
               the current limiting factors.  You may still be able to
               increase the population further if you can eliminate or change
               one of the limiting factors.  Max will never be displayed until
               after Act 2 of a region, regardless of whether the maximum has
               been reached or not.


==================================
EVENTS THAT STOP POPULATION GROWTH
==================================
The following events occur in various regions and put a complete stop to 
population growth.  You must resolve the situation before any new growth will 
resume.

==============================================================================

In trying to maximize population in each region, there are always one of three 
possible factors that will eventually limit your maximum growth:

1. Number of Souls
2. Map Size
3. Number of Structures

Every region can potentially be limited by the number of souls you have freed.  
This limitation will be determined by your score in the action portions of each 
stage.  See the "Souls" subsection below for specific scores.  You have control 
over the number of souls by targeting a high enough score in the action stages, 
so that this is never a permanent limiting factor.

After souls, regions will either be limited by physical size (no room left to 
expand) or number of structures (you have reached the 128-structure maximum).  
The table below shows which secondary factors limit population in each region:


                        Limiting
   Region                Factor 
   ======             =============

   Bloodpool           Structures
   Kasandora           Structures

   Marahna                Size
   Northwall              Size


=====
SOULS
=====
As discussed in the first section, your score during the two action sections 
determines the number of souls you can free.  To reach the maximum population 
in a region, you must therefore acquire a minimum number of cumulative points.  
The table below shows the starting number of enemies in each region (this is 
the sum of the 4 monster lairs), the maximum population, and the combined score 
you need on the two Acts to free enough souls to reach the maximum population.

|EXAMPLE                                                                     |
|You are building out Fillmore.  In Act 1, you score 10,000 points.  This    |
|adds 10,000/50 or 200 souls to the enemy lairs.  Assuming you built your    |
|town optimally, you should have a population of 702 when you enter Act 2.   |
|Now, based on the table above, you will need 20,600-10,000 or 10,600 points |
|in Act 2 to reach the maximum population.  10,600 points will yield 212     |
|souls. When added to the previous population (702+212), you now have enough |
|freed souls to reach the maximum population of 914.  However, your          |
|population can still be limited by the other factors below.                 |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Note that in addition to the souls that can be freed from monster lairs, every 
region starts you with 2 inhabitants automatically (the founders) as soon as 
Act 1 in completed.  The founders cannot be killed or turned back into souls, 
so they will always represent the minimum population in a region.


MAXIMIMIZING SOULS IN ACT 1
---------------------------
In most regions (all but Fillmore and Aitos), it is possible to score enough 
points in first action stage so that you can reach the maximum population 
before Act 2.  The advantage of doing this in the first Act is that it allows 
you to hit that region's maximum before some scripted event stalls population 
growth and forces you to retrieve an item from a different region (e.g. 
Bloodpool needing the Music from Kasandora, Kasandora needing the Herbs from 
Marahna after the plague).  This allows you to reach the highest possible 
population sooner and even allows you to reach the highest global population 
without ever needing to return to most regions after Act 2.

Here are the scores needed in Act 1 to maximize population in each region:


                    Maximum Act 1         Act 1           Remaining Act 2 
                     Population       Score Needed          Score Needed
                     ==========       =============         ============
   Fillmore           906/914            20,600                  400 
   Bloodpool          874/874            27,100                    0
   Kasandora          874/874            21,100                    0
   Aitos              778/802            22,800                1,200
   Marahna            538/538            16,300                    0
   Northwall          650/650            23,400                    0


In Fillmore and Aitos, the final houses needed to maximize population are the 
ones built via phantom construction, and this never occurs until after the Act 
2 boss has been defeated.  

One final observation about maximizing population in Act 1 is that most Act 1 
action stages are fairly stingy with points, so attempting to get enough to 
reach the totals above takes a bit of grinding.  I suspect this was done 
intentionally by the developers for balance purposes to give players a reason 
to remain in the region after Act 2 and some reward for completing the 
retrieval quests from other regions.  

The bottom line is that hitting the scores needed for the maximum souls in Act 
1 will take time.  The strategy in most of those stages will be collecting 
points, finding a 1-Up, dying, collecting the 1-Up again, and repeating.  Keep 
in mind that enemies will respawn every 11 game seconds so long as you have 
moved away from the screen where they originally spawned, so use this to your 
advantage when grinding.


==========
STRUCTURES
==========
The game has a hard limit of 128 structures in each area.  The game does not 
care about the size or type of the structures -- a bridge counts just the same 
as a house, wheat field, or factory.  Once you reach the 128-stucture limit, 
you cannot build any more structures under any circumstances.  This limit is 
most easy to see in Kasandora, where there is still ample space left when the 
building ceases.

If you cross a river once there are 128 structures, the road will continue on 
the other side but no bridge will be built (however, if you destroy some other 
supporting structure, a bridge will appear immediately as space is available, 
so be careful).

The table below shows a breakdown of the structures in each region under ideal 
conditions.  The Minimum Bridges column indicates the fewest number of bridges 
you can construct in each region.  This number is only important in Fillmore 
and Bloodpool, although in Fillmore it is still possible to reach maximum 
population with 2 bridges.  In Marahna, you can have 1 or 2 bridges and it will 
not affect maximum population.  Northwall can have up to 5 bridges with no 
adverse effect.


                      Housing       Supporting     Minimum       Total
                     Structures     Structures     Bridges     Structures
                     ==========     ==========     =======     ==========
   Fillmore             114             13            1            128
   Bloodpool            109             16            3            128
   Kasandora            109             19            0            128
   Aitos                100             12            0            112
   Marahna               67             11            1             79
   Northwall             81              8            3             92


One note on Bloodpool: even though you should need 17 wheat fields to support a 
population of 874 (with 3 bridges), the game only creates 16.  The reason for 
this is because there is simply no room left for any more wheat fields.  In 
reaching the maximum population, you will always fill every possible square 
with a field.  The game does not penalize you for this, and instead allows a 
few houses to exist despite a lack of resources to support them.


========
MAP SIZE
========
The last three regions in the game are limited by the physical size of the 
maps.  Although it may appear that there is still some additional room once the 
population is at maximum, keep in mind that there are restrictions on where 
housing structures can appear within each square (see "Inhabitable Squares" 
subsection above).  These regions will simply stop growing once there is no 
inhabitable space remaining.

Since size (and not number of structures) is the limiting population factor in 
Marahna and Northwall, you do not have to worry about the number of bridges in 
those stages.

Each region has slightly different requirements and idiosyncrasies regarding 
population growth.  The section below will list some of the basic factors for 
maximizing population in each region.  Note that this is NOT a walkthrough of 
each stage.  It is expected that you understand the basics of how to play the 
game and create cities.  If you want more general information on these topics, 
please refer to a comprehensive walkthrough.


========
FILLMORE
========
Maximum Act 1 Population: 906
Maximum Act 2 Population: 914

Fillmore is one of the pickier levels to maximize.  If you want to achieve the 
highest possible population during Act 1 of this region, you must score at 
least 20,200 points during the action stage.  This is a very tedious task, as 
the stage is short and does not have many high-point enemies.  The stage does 
have two 1-Ups, however, so you will need to use the "earn points/collect extra 
lives/die/repeat" strategy.  

The quickest way to earn a steady stream of points in Act 1 is to abuse the 
respawning of the gorilla-demon enemies (200 points).  They will reappear every 
11 game seconds after you defeat one so long as the spawn location is not 
visible.  Simply kill them, move off-screen slightly, wait 11 game seconds, 
then move back towards their spawn point and repeat.  There is a convenient 
spot to do this just after the second 1-Up before the boss. 

Once you begin the simulation, your main goal will be to complete the stage 
with 2 or fewer bridges constructed over the river (the instructions below show 
how to construct the town with only one bridge).  At the beginning, avoid 
building on any of the squares that border the river.  This includes the 
squares directly NW, W, and SW from the temple.  Seal the monster lairs in the 
south and northeast, and be sure to build over every single square with the 
exception of the aforementioned ones that border the river.

Once the southern and eastern sides of the region are built out, it's time 
carefully build around the river.  You will want to build parallel to the river 
at all times.  It is a good idea to save before you attempt this, just to be 
safe.  The map below shows the northwest portion of the map.  Below the map is 
the specific build order you should follow.

In the above picture, T represents the temple and ~ represents water.  Build in 
the follow direction and do not stop or turn:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (seal lair)

Square 6 contains a monster lair, if you have not already sealed it.  If this 
is the third lair you are sealing, you will now learn how to build bridges.  
Now things get a little tricky.  From this square, build in the following 
order:

6 -> 7 (bridge) -> 8 -> 9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 11 (seal lair)

If you only built north-south in square 3, you should not create a new bridge 
when you turn west at square 8.  You will stop on the final monster lair.  It 
is very important that you do not move the build direction square from this 
area.  If you move it to any square other than 10 or 11, a new bridge will be 
created over the river.

At this point, your civilization level will be increased.  Go around the map 
and use Lightning to destroy any level 1 or 2 buildings.  It will take a little 
while, but you should eventually cover the map with level 3 structures.  
Assuming you scored 20,200 in the Act 1 action stage, you can max out the 
population at 906 right now.  If you scored less than 20,600, make up the 
difference in Act 2.

Now, you will notice that the maximum Act 1 population is only 906.  The reason 
this is different from the Act 2 maximum is because there is a "phantom" house 
that cannot be built while you are in the region.  This house will be created 
in either square 7 below the riverbend or in square 4 below the corner of the 
river.  Leave Fillmore and go to Bloodpool or some other region and wait until 
the hour glass has filled and emptied three times.  After the third time, the 
global population should increase by 8.  When this happens, the final building 
in Fillmore will have been constructed.  Your population should now be 914.

Once your population is 914, you can move the build direction square anywhere 
you want.  Moving it over the rivers will create roads but will not construct 
new bridges.

When you return to Fillmore after completing Act 2, you will be informed in the 
temple that one of the founders passed away.  This does not reduce your 
population, despite that founder originally being included in the count.


=========
BLOODPOOL
=========
Maximum Act 1 Population: 874
Maximum Act 2 Population: 874

Bloodpool is another high maintenance level.  This stage is even easier to 
screw up than Fillmore, as there are 10 possible bridges that can be 
constructed.  Your goal is only to raise 3 of them: 1 over the north river and 
2 over the south river.

If you want to maximize population during Act 1, you will need to score 27,100 
points during the first action stage.  As in Fillmore Act 1, you will want to 
repeatedly collect the 1-Up, die, and repeat to collect more points.  There is 
an added reward for your persistence, however.  Normally, once you complete Act 
2, the region will be engulfed with conflict and the population growth will 
halt until you bring the Harmonious Music from Kasandora.  You can avoid the 
population stagnation (and technically never need to use the music at all to 
reach the maximum population) if you reach 27,100 points during Act 1.

Once the simulation begins and you have cleared away the marshland, focus on 
developing the area to the north of the temple.  Do NOT build east, west, or 
south at this point.  When the northern area is cultivated and the monster lair 
is sealed, it's time to tackle the bridges.  Note that you need to use the 
Bridge item from Fillmore before you can cross the rivers.  As in the last 
stage, it's a good idea to save before this point.

The map below shows the southern portion of this region.

In the above image, T is the temple and ~ represents water.  Squares 6 and 15 
contain monster lairs.  Start at the temple and build in the following order 
(note that you do not ever need to build on the square east of the temple; it 
will create bridges but cannot hold houses):

T -> 1 -> T

As stated, build to the square west of the temple, then build right back.  Do 
not turn south or stop while on square 1.  Next, build as follows:

T -> 2 (bridge) -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (seal lair)

You should now seal the monster lair at square 6.  Note, once again, the back-
and-forth build order between squares 2 and 3.  So long as you do not turn 
inside the square, you will not create roads in a different direction.  Once 

the monster lair at square 6 is sealed, build as follows:

6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9 -> 8

You should only be able to order the building direction square this far in a 
single command.  At this point, you should have covered every inhabitable 
square above the south river.  If you need to go back north for some reason, 
move right to square 7 before heading north.  Now, the build order for the 
south:

8 -> 10 (bridge) -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 12 -> 11

So far, you have only constructed one bridge over the southern river.  From 
here, finish up the region in this order:

11 -> 14 -> 15 (seal lair) -> 12 -> 16 (bridge)

This final sequence seals the southern lair, constructs an additional bridge 
over the south river, and completes the development of the stage.  Once you 
seal the lair at square 15, you should reach civilization level 3.  Begin 
destroying all level 1 and 2 houses and watch the population soar.

If you scored 27,100 during the action portion of Act 1, you will be able to 
hit 874 people before taking on the second boss.  If not, try to score enough 
points so your Act 1 + Act 2 scores total 27,100.  After completing Act 2, the 
population growth will stop until you bring the Music item from Kasandora. You 
will need to wait until then to maximize the population.


=========
KASANDORA
=========
Maximum Act 1 Population: 874
Maximum Act 2 Population: 874

Kasandora is probably the easiest region to max.  Use the Wheat item on the 
first field that appears and build out as you wish.  If you want to maximize 
population during Act 1, you will need to score 21,100 points during the first 
action stage.  

If score under 21,100 in Act 1, you may wish to avoid building over the square 
with the lost desert wanderer under after you have completed Act 2 and reached 
a population of 874.  Saving this man will immediately trigger the plague after 
Act 2, which halts population growth.  In fact, none of the following events 
will occur unless the wanderer is found:

   1. Discovery of the scroll that the wanderer possessed
   2. Birth of the Harmonious Music
   3. Discovery of the scroll at the southern mountain
   4. Discovery of the Ancient Tablet in the northwest
   5. Spread of the plague

If you rescue the wanderer before reaching the maximum population, you will 
need to wait until finding the Herbs in Marahna to finish the stage.  Even 
without building over the wanderer's square, there is ample room in the stage 
to maximize population.

Finally, while unlikely, it is possible that your population may stall before 
reaching the maximum if your citizens have built more wheat fields than they 
need.  This is rare, but it can happen if you manually use the Wheat item to 
convert corn fields.  A population of 874 only needs 19 wheat fields.  If your 
population has inexplicably stopped short of 874, count the fields and destroy 
any excess ones with lightning.  This will fix the issue.


=====
AITOS
=====
Maximum Act 1 Population: 778
Maximum Act 2 Population: 802

Aitos is also relatively simple to build.  You can construct the town in any 
order you want.  If you want to reach the highest population level in Act 1, 
you will need to score 22,800 points in the Act 1 action stage.  This is not an 
easy task since there is no 1-Up in this stage, but it is possible to do by 
fighting as many enemies as you can until the timer expires. 

During the simulation, be sure not to miss any inhabitable squares, 
particularly in the south by the mountains.

The Act 1 population maxes out at 778, which is three houses short of the Act 2 
maximum.  These three "phantom" houses will eventually be built in the 
southernmost three squares.  They cannot be built while you are in the region 
because they are blocked by other structures and cannot be accessed by the 
townspeople.  After Act 2, go to another stage and wait until the hour glass 
has filled and emptied three times; the global population will jump by 24.  
Assuming your cumulative score on Act 1 + Act 2 is 24,000, Aitos should now be 
complete with 802 people.


=======
MARAHNA
=======
Maximum Act 1 Population: 538
Maximum Act 2 Population: 538

Marahna is the quickest stage to build and does not require any special order. 
Simply use wheat on the first crop and develop the town in any way you would 
like.  You can maximize the population in Act 1 by scoring 16,300 in the action 
stage.  If you choose to go for this score, the second part of the stage has a 
1-Up and is the best area for grinding.  However, it is much easier to make up 
any score difference in Act 2, as that stage racks up points very easily.

It is possible to build up to two bridges in this stage, but these do not limit 
population size.  The first bridge crosses the river leading to the monster 
lair in the southwest corner.  The second bridge can be built two squares right 
of this one.  Place the build direction square on that location. Command the 
game to start and stop the build order on that square without moving to any 
other square.  The build square will not move, but it should create a north-
south road and construct a bridge to nowhere.  Doing that is probably more of a 
novelty than anything else.


=========
NORTHWALL
=========
Maximum Act 1 Population: 650
Maximum Act 2 Population: 650

Like the previous three regions, Northwall does not have any special build 
order.  In fact, Northwall's construction is always pretty linear given the 
restriction from building east of the river until the two monster lairs are 
sealed.  If you scored 23,400 points during the action stage, you can max out 
Northwall during Act 1.  That is a relatively difficult score to amass, but, if 
you decide to do so, take advantage of the 1-Up and 1,000-point token in the 
first indoor cave.  

This region begins with corn fields.  While you can plant wheat, you do not 
need to.  The level 3 supporting structures can replace the fields.

Shortly after the town begins development, the people will complain that they 
are too cold to continue building.  You will need to give them the Sheep's 
Fleece from Aitos before they will resume.  There is no other way to get around 
this stoppage.

This region can have up to 5 bridges, but you do not need to worry about them 
affecting the population; build as many as you'd like.  Once all the monster 
lairs are sealed, destroy the level 1 and 2 buildings (with an earthquake).  
Also, you will want to destroy all remaining wheat fields, as more efficient 
factories will spring up to replace them.

In order to make sure all houses can be built, you will need to have a bridge 
going east-west on the river one square below the temple.  If you don't have 
this bridge, the house in the bottom left corner cannot be built (although it 
can still be "phantom" constructed after Act 2 without that bridge).


==============================================================================
7.  T H E   I N A C C E S S I B L E   S Q U A R E S                       AR09
==============================================================================

The maximum population detailed above in this guide (4,652) is the highest that 
you can legitimately achieve in Actraiser.  However, the game does possess 5 
squares that will allow houses to be constructed that you normally can't access 
because the building direction cursor will not pass over them.  However, if the 
building direction cursor *could* pass over them, the game would populate them 
with houses in a perfectly normal fashion.  

It's possible to experience this using PAR/Game Genie codes and exceed the 
game's maximum population.  This does not produce any negative side effects 
whatsoever, as the game will just treat those squares like any others and will 
follow the same building algorithm it does normally.  The game will also create 
proper roads and bridges in each square.

The additional squares that can be populated are in Aitos (3 squares) and 
Marhana (2 squares).  The specific squares are below, with coordinates in [row, 
column] format (going from the top-left corner; use the miracle cursor to 
easily see which square you’re in).

1. Aitos [3,3]: This square covers the top of the volcano.  One additional
   house can be built here, in the top-right corner of the square.

2. Aitos [4,4]: This is directly on top of the small mountain southeast of the
   volcano.  One additional house can be built here, in the top-right corner
   of the square.

3. Aitos [5,6]: This square covers the cliffs exactly one square up and one
   square right from the temple.  It can hold two additional houses, one at
   the top and one at the bottom.  

4. Marahna [2,2]: This is on southern coast of the northern peninsula.  Two
   additional houses can be built, which will both be in the top-right corner
   of the square.

5. Marahna [6,2]: This is the same square as the temple you enter to fight the
   Act 2 boss.  Building onto this square will even create a bridge that will
   extend to the side of the river with the temple.  One additional house will
   be constructed along the bottom of the square.

If you build out all 5 of these squares, which constructs 7 additional houses, 
you will now have the following populations:


                   MAX
                POPULATION              
                ==========
   Aitos           834
   Marahna         562  
   -------        -----
   Global         4,708


If you would like to build over these squares and experience this for yourself, 
enter the PAR codes below.  There are two codes needed to enable each square 
for building.  Once entered, simply move the building direction cursor over 
each square and wait a normal cycle for new houses to be built.  Note that 
housing construction for these houses are subject to exactly the same 
constraints as for any others, so you will still need to have enough freed 
souls and no other regional conditions that prevent building.


Aitos [3,3]       7F69A3B8 / 7F69A4B8
Aitos [4,4]       7F69B5B8 / 7F69B6B8
Aitos [5,6]       7F69CAB8 / 7F69CBB8

==============================================================================

While you can typically score enough points in Act 1+2 by playing normally to 
free enough souls to reach the maximum population, you may opt to reach this 
total after Act 1 to maximize a region's population sooner. The advantages of 
doing this are described throughout the guide.  If you do go that route, some 
grinding will be required.  Below are a few general tips for scoring points and 
hopefully making that process a little easier.


1. GRIND NEAR AREAS WITH A 1-UP
This is probably common sense to most people reading this guide, but the best 
ways to earn points in the action stages are to find some area with a 1-Up and 
then repeatedly kill enemies in that area until the timer expires.  The 1-Ups 
are replenished each time you die, so you can repeat this cycle indefinitely 
for enough points provided you have the patience.

You can find at least one 1-Up in every action stage except for the two in 
Aitos.  Among the two Aitos stages, I personally prefer the Act 1 stage for 
earning points, in particular the area near the end where the waterfall section 
starts.

2. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ENEMY RESPAWNING
Most of the lesser enemies in Actraiser will respawn.  Specifically, they 
respawn every 11 game seconds after being killed provided you've left the 
screen and can no longer see their spawn point.  Use this knowledge to plan 
routes so that by the time you move from one part of the stage to another, all 
the enemies will have respawned.

3. EXTRA LIVES ARE A VALUABLE SOURCE FOR POINTS
After you beat the Act stage boss, you receive 1,000 points for every extra 
life and 10 points for every second remaining on the game clock.  In addition 
to making sure you collect all the 1-Ups in each stage, this underscores the 
benefit of collecting all the Source of Life items, which provide a permanent 
starting increase to your extra life reserves.

For quick reference, here are the locations of the four Sources of Life:
    1. Fillmore: Use the Compass, received in Bloodpool after using the
       Harmonious Music (after Act 2 only)
    2. Bloodpool: Use Rain on the northern part of the lake    
    3. Kasandora: Use Earthquake once the Pyramid is uncovered
    4. Northwall: Use Lightning on the temple

==============================================================================

The rationale for focusing on population is primarily because it ties into your 
current level, as well has hit points (HP) and spell points (SP).  The table 
below shows the population required to reach each level, as well as the HP and 
SP at that level.  Level 17 is the highest level you can reach.


     o--------------------------------------o
     |  Level  |Population|   HP   |   SP   |
     |---------|----------|--------|--------|
     |    1    |     --   |    8   |   20   |

If you would like to explore the effects of population on your own, there is no 
better way to do it than by examining the memory addresses.  This section 
provides the locations of many relevant statistics that relate to population. 
The following section assumes you have some minor knowledge of emulation and 
memory editing, as no background information on these topics will be provided 
here.


==================
CIVILIZATION LEVEL
==================
Civilization level affects the types of housing structures that can be created. 
The higher the civilization level, the more people each house will hold.  At 
level 3, the highest quality building will be constructed.  In the codes below, 
XX will range from 01 (lowest) to 03 (highest).

Fillmore      7E022EXX
Bloodpool     7E0230XX
Kasandora     7E0232XX
Aitos         7E0234XX
Marahna       7E0236XX
Northwall     7E0238XX


============
SOUL COUNTER
============
Each region has a separate soul counter.  The future population is limited by 
this number of souls.  The soul counter is represented by two bytes.  XX can 
range from 00 to FF on each byte (no value will crash the game).  Setting the 
first byte to 40 (64 in decimal) will be enough to allow for maximum expansion 
in all regions.

Fillmore      7F9EFAXX / 7F9EFBXX
Bloodpool     7F9EFCXX / 7F9EFDXX
Kasandora     7F9EFEXX / 7F9EFFXX
Aitos         7F9F00XX / 7F9F01XX
Marahna       7F9F02XX / 7F9F03XX
Northwall     7F9F04XX / 7F9F05XX


==================
MONSTER LAIR COUNT
==================
These codes control the number of enemies in each monster lair.  There are four 
lairs in every region.  Setting a lair to 00 will eliminate all the monsters in 
that lair.  If you use these codes to eliminate all monsters in a region, you 
must also use the Soul Counter codes above, otherwise you will never be able to 
free enough souls to grow the town.  Each lair has two bytes that can range 
from 00 to FF.  The game will only display up to 999 monsters in the lair if 
the counter is over that total.  However, it will still accurately track enemy 
counts over 999.


                Lair 1          Lair 2          Lair 3          Lair 4
