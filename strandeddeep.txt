### Resources

- Tools with Durability can (and should) be used up to 1% before consumed in other crafting recipes.
  This applies to Stone Tool, both Axes and the Crude Hammer

- https://www.reddit.com/r/strandeddeep/comments/nbj8xj/guide_complete_deforestation_in_7_easy_steps_pros/

- To save inventory slots and raft weight, attach Sticks/Buoys/Barrels/Tires/ as temporary Raft Bases and dismantle at home.
  Similar for Planks and Corrugated Scrap as Raft Floors


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Achievements

- Building the Gyrocopter nulls the "Magnets, how do they work?" achievement, as it has a built-in COmpass
- "Two by Two" requires 2 Giant Crab, 2 Night Snake, 2 Hog (aggressive large pig), 2 Wild Boar (passive smaller pig)
	Possibly need to be in front of you, not behind


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Rafts

- If a Raft Base is connected on more than one side it's permanent
- If your sail is open while you use the motor the raft goes at sail speed
- Sail positioning does NOT matter, only its direction. Maybe Rudder too?
- All Floor materials are equivalent. They all add weight to the raft (developer @ 2018), but it seems it does NOT.
- Bases have different heights and possibly buyoancys (supported weight), so build them simmetrically
- Sharks and Bosses cannot destroy any Raft, and cannot flip 2x2 or larger Rafts.
- Default Motor steering is horrible (too sensitive, goes in sharp circles). Auto-Walk is a great workaround (double-tap forward)

Raft Rudder and Motor placement Quirks:
	Base can be attached behind Rudder or Anchor (covering it), but NOT behind Motor
	If they're removed afterwards, can't rebuild unless back base is removed too (and rember bases
	Motor can be build in such back base behind a covered Rudder ONLY IF there are no bases to the side of the back base
		XXX is fine, but XXX is not. Go figure!
		 R               XRX
		 M                M
	You can build the side bases afterwards, but if motor is removed it can't be rebuild (similar to covered Rudder above)

Fully dismantable raft layout, start dismantling by either Y:
OUTDATED: Might not dismantle weight pivot or initial base
	XY-
	X-Y
	XXX
https://www.reddit.com/r/strandeddeep/comments/nc83az/ship_design_wollie_3x3_the_fully_uncraftable_ship/

For Container Panels and Doors, if a Raft is large enough to be *stable* (~4x3 will do), size does NOT matter:
- 2 panels is barely noticeable
- 4 sinks a bit, fully operational
- 6 sinks a lot, rudder operational but underwater
- 8 sinks all the way


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Scavenging

- Loot in containers (Locker, Console, Wood Crate) are random and set when first *opening* the container.
  Taking a Wood Crate without opening it does NOT set its contents.
- Ship counts as Scavenged on Watch when all containers are either opened or taken.
  Freeing Barrels/Tyres/Buoys do not count, so no way to track them.
- Save before opening containers and reload to re-roll contents.
- Intact submerged Ships may have entrance on deck floor, invisible hole/trapdoor that looks covered with rusty texture
- Yatchs may have Large Locker that's very hard to find and easy to miss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Food and Farming

- Canned Food fulfills 3+ both water and hunger
- Yukka Fruit (the seed) only grows once, after first harvest, if harvested with refined knife
- Yukka Trees, planted or wild, takes 48h to regrow
- Farms use 1 water every 12 hours. There's at least 3 full days worth of water in a plank or metal farm.
- Smoked Meat lasts forever, but must be cooked AND smoked. Wait for Smoker's 2nd ring! Takes a LONG time.
- Spoiled items are still good for planting, fuel (Potatoes) and crafting (Antidote, etc). Spoiled Meat is therefore useless.
- Spoilable:
	Any Meat (Raw or Cooked but not Smoked)
	Edible Fruits: Kura, ...
	Potato
	Egg
	Cocunut Food (opened Coconut)
- NON-spoilable:
	Yukka Fruit
	Fibrous Leaves
	Non-Edible Herbs: Pipi (poison), Aloe (sunblock), ...
	Dead but not fully skinned animals (tested with crab)
	Coconut and its Drink (skinned Coconut, either full or empty)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Exploring

- When leaving home island, take note of Date/Time, Islands Visited and Ships Scavenged.
  To keep track of home farms irrigation (return date) and fully scavenged treasures
	Day 122 1AM
	Islands: 9
	Ships: 16

- If more than 3 days have passed, wait for thunderstorm before going back to avoid losing crops

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Exploiting

- Saving, exiting and reloading will increase grown crops by 1, repeat to harvest multiple times
	Saving multiple times before exiting or reloading multiple times the same save does NOT trigger this
	Also affect Container Walls/Doors on Cargo Ships
	May also affect some ships so they don't count as scavenged on Watch

- Raft Floor can be removed after crafting Container Shelves on top of it.
	Floor might be placed back if bottom shelf is empty

- Poison heals by itself after 72 hours. Sleep early (18h) to minimize health depletion

- With Max Building/Crafting, use the full material refund when dismantling stuff to get:
	- free Water with Water Still
	- free full Fuel with Campfire
	- free 100% durability restore on Refined Axe and Crude Hammer with Plant Station

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### World and Cartographer

- World is a 5x5 grid, starting island on center, 3 Bosses and Carrier Ship (end game)
- Islands can be Large (mountain pillar, tall pine trees) or Small.
- Large Islands have 2 Giant Crabs, 0-1 Hog, 1-2 Pigs, 1-2 Snakes. Small have 1-2 Giant Crab
- Starting Island is always Small without animals, just (small) Crabs.
- Seed controls islands shape, features and shipwrecks, NOT Bosses locations!
- Good Seed (7 Cargo Ships): 21848428
- Cartographer marks in red the 3 Bosses, Carrier Ship and the Island currently saved
  This makes it very easy to know where you are: save, exit and check Cartographer.

### Start

- Ignore Tutorial for now
- Find 1 Rock, craft Stone Tool
- Find and Chop the 3 Yukka Trees. For each, grab Fruit, 2 Leaves and craft 1 Leashing to consume the other 4
- Grab Sticks, Rocks, use Stone Tool on 2 x Palms Bushes then Trees and Saplings until 1%
- Use 1% Stone Tools to craft Crude Hoe, Hammer, Axe. Save 1 for Refined Knife
- Use Life Boat rations for initial Water and Food needs. Drink Cocunuts only to leverage Water.
- Craft Camp Fire, Fire Pit, Shelter
- Grab 2 x Cocunuts and 1 x Cloth, craft Water Still, Water Flask. NEVER drink from it, save for crops
- Craft Crude Spears when needed to level up Crafting, up to 12.
- Use only Fronds for Fuel and Water Still. Leaves are needed for initial Lashings, Sticks for Raft Bases
- Save 2 Planks/Corrugated for initial Raft Floor
- Use extra Planks, Corrugated Metal, Sticks/Lashes to build 3+ Farm Plots, plant Yukka
- Craft Loom and Cloths for Smoker, Rudder, Sail
- Don't bother with Raft yet: Sail + Rudder requires additional 2 x Cloth you won't have until Loom / next Island
- Initial (temporary) Raft, using bases with whatever found on shipwrecks + Sticks, in build order:
	BA
	C G
	DEF
- Rudder and Anchor on A, Sail on B
- Initial Scavenges: re-roll until, in priority order:
	1-3 x Leather, if no Sharks (Passive). 2 for Refined Pick (Clay and Stone Deposits), 1 for Refined Axe (Plank Station)
	1 x Corrugated Scrap, if uneven, for Farm Plots
	1 x Refined Hammer
	1 x Oxygen, for Speargun
	Jerrycan, as many as possible
	Motor parts, non-duplicated
- Fill Farm Plots and sail with Life Boat to closest Large island.
  Take with you:
	Refined Knife, Crude Axe and Hammer, 12+ x Crude Spear in Wood Crates. Bring back, in priority order:
	Rawhide, as many as possible
	Even Corrugated Scrap / Planks
	Palm Bunches
