Author's Note                                                 ffviii_002
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it has been a long time since I have made an update for the FAQ.
Even though the FAQ is already completed, there are still errors that
required me to correct it. 

What's has been added to the FAQ?
- Frequently Asked Questions --> Well, for the past few months since
  FF8 has been released, I have received countless e-mails regarding 
  this game and I have decided to compile them. Otherwise, I will be
  repeated those answers over and over again. Of course, once I have  
  added the list of questions, I will not be answering them anymore.
  BTW, if you have any problems regarding weapon upgrading, please
  refer to the ultimate weapon upgrading guide.
  Just added some more words for the previous update, I have finally
  found out some of remaining burning questions which causes me to 
  add them to the section. Remember to check it!

- The third hint of Obel Lake Mystery --> thanks to one helpful 
  contributor who has told me about this third hint [well, can't expect
  that it is actually a joke...]. Refer to Obel Lake Mystery Section
  for more details.

- Search Mode --> A lot of FAQ readers have complained to me that the 
  FAQ being too long as it takes ages to search for the information that 
  you need. I have finally found a method, which is being obtained from 
  Dingo Jellybean's FF7 FAQ but I have made some improvements to it. All 
  you just need to do the following: (Note: there are actually people 
  who tends to overlook this capability of WordPad and I myself is also 
  one of them ^_^;)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method 1:
  From the toolbar, select Edit and choose Find. Enter the keyword.

  Method 2:
  Use the short-cut key Ctrl+F and you will see the Search Box popped
  up. Enter the keyword that you want to look for. 

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  But sometimes the keyword does not reached your desired destination,
  hence I have come up with a good idea and that's to add codes to the
  right side of the contents page. Just enter the following keyword:

  ffviii_xxx 

  where xxx stands for the 3-digit code for the section. The list of 
  code numbers can be found at the Table of Contents. But remember that
  you must enter the "ffviii_" in order for it to work, or you will 
  find that you will end up at other pages instead! 

- Note to all webmasters. If you want to post the FAQ on your site, make
  sure that you keep update and get the latest versions. I will always 
  sent my FAQs to GameFAQs. I will definitely not permit anyone else to 
  edit my FAQs. No HTMLizing for my FAQs. Final Fantasy: Worlds Apart
  (http://www.ffnet.net) is an exception.

- Strangely enough, I have received e-mails regarding whether I am doing
  a FAQ for Final Fantasy IX. I am about 75% sure that I will NOT be 
  writing a FAQ for it due to several personal reasons. Anyway, I guess
  someone else will write a FAQ for that game. [But this means that you 
  can be ensured that there will be FAQs for Final Fantasy IX.]. BTW, 
  check out Dingo's FF9 FAQ, which is rather great. I don't intend to
  write out FAQs for great games... this one is already a killer ^_^;)

- I have corrected most of grammatical errors as being requested by 
  viewers. Thanks to them, otherwise I will not known the seriousness of
  the problems. I will try my best to correct errors for my other FAQs 
  once I have time. 

- I hoped that this may be the final update for this FAQ. BTW, I am no
  longer accepting strategies and questions regarding this FAQ. ALL the 
  stuffs that I know about FF8 can be found in this FAQ and Part II. If
  you have any recommendations, complaints, secrets regarding this game,
  and just e-mail to me and I will try my best to solve it.

- I am quite sorry for not answering any e-mails after my March 
  vacation as I have been rather busy with my assignments, projects
  and examinations. You should get your reply shortly. BTW, there will 
  be no reply for those who do not add "FF8" or "Final Fantasy VIII" as 
  I have deleted the e-mails that does not have this as a subject. [
  except for those that contains other game headings]

- BTW, if you intend to place this FAQ on your site, you are free to do
  so as long as the FAQ remained intact and make sure you make an effort
  to get the latest revisions of my FAQs. Don't bother to e-mail on 
  requests on place the FAQ on your site. [Applies to my FF8 FAQs only.]

For this update [Version 1.9 and 1.10]
- I have found a couple of vital information regarding cards, boss 
  facts and added a few tips in weapon upgrading.
- BTW, you can check my FF8 Part II for the new Chocobo World section,
  which is typed by The Saint (saintly@innocent.com). 
- I have also expanded the Junction section to make it more detail. It
  will also explains why you can't equip a menu ability on the character.
- Finally, here is the list of FF8 questions that are still being asked:
  - How to get the Lion Heart.
  - Where to locate the Deep Sea Research Center.
  - How to get GFs that you have forgotten to draw from BOSSES.
  - Where to locate the White SeeD Ship.
  - How to defeat Adel at low levels?
  - Is it possible to enter towns in Disc 4?
  - How to mug an item?
  - How to junction commands [well, it seems that I need to go to detail
    regarding the basic of basics...]
  - Where do General Caraway go after he brought you to the Gateway?
  - Who is Squall's father? [with proof, of course]
  - Rumours...
- I have added a whole chunk of cheats for the PC version. Thanks to a
  helpful contributor.
  I had explained them in the Frequently Asked Questions. BTW, the 
  reason, I am making the update is because I don't have the time to
  reply my e-mails. BTW, the next update will be the final update of 
  this FAQ.
  
                                                             [Scott Ong]

Frequently Asked Questions [Game play]                        ffviii_004
========================================================================
For this section, you will find all those frequently asked questions and
the key events of the game. Note that these are the questions, which I
will not reply anymore. BTW, if you have problems regarding BOSS fight,
please check out Part II for the guides that you need.

Last Updated: 14/10/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list may be expanded depends on the number of e-mails that I have
recieved on that particular topic. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.   How do you junction commands?
A:   You can ONLY junction commands (such as Magic, Item, Draw, etc.) 
     and abilities (Mag-J, Str-J, Str+20%, SumMag +20%, Counter, Cover, 
     etc) if you have a GF equipped for the characters. To equip a GF,
     select the character and Junction from the main menu. Next pick a
     GF and you will be able to equip the command! You can more help 
     from the Tutorial Menu in the game.

                                       Gilgamesh will be lost.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.   I had forgotten to draw a GF! Are there any other methods to get 
     it?
A:   YES! You can get the GF by drawing it from the BOSSES found in the
     Ultimecia's Castle. Refer to Disc 4 walkthrough for more 
     information. I did not include in the walkthrough as this will
     help to avoid spoilers. BTW, some of GF summoning items [Solomon's
     Ring for Doomtrain and Magical Lamp for Diablos] can be retrieved
     from the Pocketstation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.   I had sold the Magical Lamp! Is there a method to get it later in
     game?
A:   Unfortunately no. In fact, that's the only Magical Lamp you can 
     get from playing the game. You can get more Magical Lamps as you
     can get it from the Pocketstation. [Refer to Pocketstation guides
     that found in GameFAQs. You can find more information under the
     Pocketstation section in Part II. Please note that I don't own a 
     Pocketstation.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.   What is the purpose of SeeD tests?
A:   Note for all new players, you can only get cash through your SeeD
     salary. You will get your salary, once Squall has become an 
     official SeeD member after Dollet's test at Disc 1. The SeeD level
     will change if you do any of following:

     SeeD Test
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Method                                                Effect
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     Answering SeeD tests with correct answers. Access     Increase 
     SeeD test from Tutorial menu --> TEST menu.           SeeD level.

     Continue with the story of the game                   Increase
                                                           SeeD level.
  
     Finish Train sequence in Disc 1 upon first try        SeeD level
                                                           +1

     Walking around the world map, field terrains without  Decrease
     doing anything.                                       SeeD level

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     SeeD levels do not increase every time. In fact, it increases
     based on the number of steps that Squall walk on the terrains. 
     Hence, do not try to not overdo it as it will decrease your SeeD 
     level.

     The higher SeeD level, the more cash [in gil] that you will
     receive each time. For the test answers, refer to the walkthrough
     for disc 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.   I have seen a UFO moving around in a random battle and nothing 
     happens..  What was that?
A:   It is the UFO Sighting Incident. There are four sighting spots
     which is being marked on the world map found at 
     <http://risland.virtualave.net>. Just go there with Diablo's 
     Enc-None and move around to have a random battle. For more
     details, refer to the World Tour under the Disc 3 Walkthrough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.   Why I can't convert 100x Curse Spikes into Dark Matter through GF
     Siren's Tool-RF, in order learn Quistis' last Limit Break, 
     Shockwave Pulsar?
A:   In order to do that, GF Siren must reach LV 100. Otherwise, you 
     will not be able to do the refinement. As for the help in getting
     Curse Spikes, you need to defeat the Imp, Forbidden or Malboro.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.   Is it true that you can't have both items obtained from stealing
     and defeat monsters?
A:   Yes. You can get only get one of the items. For example, let's 
     says you encountered a battle with 2x Adamantoises, you defeat 
     them without any characters using the Mug command. You will get 
     the item won from battle, such as Adamantine, Whisper, Orichalons 
     based on Squall's level.
     If you mug any of the Adamantoises, you will DEFINATELY NOT get 
     Adamantine [which can only be obtained by defeating both 
     Adamantoises]. Instead, you will get other items such as Whispers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.   How do I get Squall's ultimate weapon and Limit Break, Lion Heart?
A:   To get Squall's ultimate weapon, you must have the following
     items:
     1x    Adamantine
     3x    Dragon Fang
     12x   Pulse Ammo

     << Recommended Methods >> - these are the easiest methods
     Adamantine - you can get this by defeat Adamantoises found shores 
     of Dollet, Long Horn Island [to find the location of Long Horn 
     Island, view the world map at http://risland.virtualave.net].

     Dragon Fang - head towards Trabia area where you find the Shumi 
     Village. Note that from the world map's point of view, you will
     find a row of mountains behind the village. Just walk closely 
     against mountains and you will encounter Blue Dragons. Defeat it
     to get Dragon Fang.

     Pulse Ammo - you need to get Energy Crystal. Get 20x Elynole's card
     via card playing and you can convert them into 2x Energy Crystals
     through Quezacotl's Card-Mod RF. Next convert the Energy Crystals 
     through Ifrit's Ammo-RF. You will get 20x Pulse Ammo. 

     Now go to any of the junk shops found in the game and pay 2000 gil 
     to remodel Squall's gunblade into Lion Heart. I have explained in
     more details under the Ultimate Weapon Upgrading section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.  Where are the Islands closest to Heaven / Hell?
A:   It is kind of difficult to explain using words. You can get find 
     the locations of them on a world map at my website 
     <http://risland.virtualave.net/map.html>. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.  I can't locate the Deep Sea Research Center! Where can I find it?
A:   To locate the Deep Sea Research Center, you need the Ragnarok 
     airship. Pilot the airship to the extreme low-left corner of the 
     world map. 

     Move the Ragnarok low by press Down button. When you move the 
     Ragnarok, you should see water splashing... Next navigate around 
     that corner and you should find the Deep Sea Research Center. If 
     you have any problems, get the world map mentioned in the above 
     URL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.  Why is there a screen showing "censored" when I used the Devour
     Command? 
A:   It was just like that! ^_^;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.  Question on Card Games
A:   Well, it consists of a huge portion of my e-mails. Here is a 
     section for it:

     Rare Cards - it is true that there is only one version of rare
     cards, not after time compression has occurred. To get back the
     lost rare cards, you need to defeat the CC Group Members at 
     Ragnarok airship in Disc 4. (provided that you have defeat them 
     in Disc 2.). You can get them back even after you have refined the
     card using Quezacotl's Card-Mod.
   
     Card Queen - the Card Queen is really tough as she changes the
     card rules and moves from areas to areas, which made her an 
     extremely tough opponent. If you need more help, get FF8 FAQ
     Part II at http://www.gamefaqs.com and refer to the Card Queen's
     Side Quest.

     Obtaining cards - besides getting it by winning the card game, 
     you can also get cards by defeating enemies or using the card 
     command to convert dying enemies into cards [does not work on
     BOSS and human beings]

     Card Rules - It will be very difficult to explain the rules in
     a few sentences, hence there is a need to read the Card section
     of FF8 FAQ Part II.

     Abolish a Card Rule - a lot of gamers get frustrated regarding
     the random rule as it will force you into a bad situation in the
     card game. To abolish that rule, you can either play in a region
     where there is no such rules. One perfect example is Balamb area.
     Rules will be added as soon as you started in an area where there
     are new rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.  Tough Battles - answers found at my Monsters FAQ @ GameFAQs
A:   It seems that a lot of people are having trouble regarding combat
     in FF8. There are a few reasons for the toughness and one of them 
     is that monsters levelling up as your character does. There are 
     few methods to be stronger than your enemy:
     The hints are:
     - by remodelling the characters' weapons 
     - get stronger spells via item refining. 
     You can get a lot of rare items via cards. This means if you want 
     an easy life in the game, play cards often!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.  Can I get into the cities during Disc 4?
A:   There is no way that you can get into the cities in Disc 4. Those
     barriers do not allow you to make contact with the city. I know
     the following question will definitely pop up if this happens...
     * how do I remodel my weapons? - you can remodel your weapons by 
       using GF Tonberry's Call Shop or Call Junk Shop menu ability via
       the Ability menu. 
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.  I have sold the Magical Lamp. Is there any other way to get it?
A:   Finally found the answers for this... You can't draw Diablos from
     any of the bosses [bosses at Lunatic Pandora and Boss Sphinxaur in 
     Ultimecia's Castle]. Once you sold it, you got to reset if you 
     don't own a Pocketstation or Gameshark. It is still possible to 
     complete the game without GF Diablos, but it will definitely be 
     tougher.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.  Where are weapon monthly magazines?
A:   You don't need these items as it is compulsory to remodel your 
     characters' weapon. In fact, the weapon's name will appear in the 
     Junk Shop's menu once you have obtained its requirements. Here is a 
     short list of weapon magazines:

     Weapon Monthly March  - you will get this by defeating Elvoret at
                             Dollet's Communication Tower in Disc 1.
     Weapon Monthly April  - you will get this from Squall's desk after
                             completing the sequence in Training 
                             Center. (after the ball dance)
     Weapon Monthly May    - you can find this in the sewers while 
                             controlling Rinoa. Refer to walkthrough for
                             more information.
     Weapon Monthly June   - defeat BGHZ51F2 at Missile Base
     Weapon Monthly July   - found it in Balamb Garden's Training Center
                             after Disc 2.
     Weapon Monthly August - found it near the Gargoyle in Trabia 
                             Garden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.  Why I can't get the second vase piece (found at the statue) in 
     Winhill?
A:   Well, this is really my error and thanks to those whom have help me
     in solving this and that is you really need to have Irvine in your 
     party. I guess it was perhaps due to the itching hands of 
     Irvine ^_^;) Remember the time when he messes up the guns in Zell's
     room [for those whom have Irvine in your party]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.  Where can I locate the Tomb of Unknown King?
A:   It seems that this type of question is one of hardiest for me to
     answer. Imagine explaining the location using words. It was 
     actually located on a peninsula, which is northeast from Deling. The
     tomb is quite small in size and if you still have the problem, get
     the world map found at <http://risland.virtualave.net>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.  How do I use the character's Limit Breaks?
A:   First of all, your characters need to get to "Crisis" conditions. 
     It will be fulfilled when:
     - the character's HP turns red/yellow
     - Aura is being cast on the character

     Next to use the Limit Break, just tap Circle button (menu button)
     and you will eventually see a golden triangle on the right side of
     "Attack" or "Mug". Press right and you will be able to execute the
     Limit Break.

     General Tip on getting Aura.
     Aura is a magic that allows your character to get Limit Breaks
     easily. To get Aura magic, you need to get Fury Fragments which 
     can be mugged from Blue Dragon found at the mountains near Shumi
     Village. [you don't need to stand on the mountain, just go near 
     it]. Next just convert the Fury Fragment into 5x Aura magic 
     through Leviathan's Supt Mag-RF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.  How do I return back to the Lunatic Pandora after I have finished
     the "Ragnarok crash scene" in Disc 3?

A:   You can choose to exit the Pandora after your Ragnarok has made 
     its way to the Lunatic Pandora in Disc 3. To exit, just to talk to 
     Selphie. From there, you can enjoy yourself for the quests or do
     some level up. After you are done, proceed to the bridge [or 
     controls room] and talk to Selphie and you will be back at the
     Lunatic Pandora!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.  Is it possible to do the Lion Heart Limit Break each time once you
     have acquired the Lion Heart gunblade?
A:   No. The occurence of the Lion Heart Limit Break depends on chance.
     You can't control it. But Lion Heart seems to appear more 
     frequently, once the entire party is down to critical status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.  How do I get Limit Breaks for every characters?
A:   Squall  - Upgrade his gunblade and Squall will learn new Limit 
               Breaks. [see Part II for more details.]
     Quistis - Get Blue Magic Items [refer to Part II item bestiary on
               how to get them] and use it on Quistis.
     Zell    - Get Combat Kings and select the item and Zell will learn
               the new Limit Breaks automatically.
     Selphie - Get it from her Limit Breaks. While you are choosing the
               type of spells, you can find her Limit Breaks [including
               those that are not uncovered.]. Cast it and Selphie will
               have that Limit Breaks.
     Rinoa   - Get Pet Pals and select the item. Next check the status
               screen and select the limit break that you wish to teach
               Angelo. Hence walk around on the terrain for a while. 
               Once the gauge has built up, Rinoa will learn the Limit
               Break!
     Irvine  - Get the Ammo and he will have new Limit Breaks. Some of
               the rare ammo are quite hard to get.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. How do I enhance my character's statistics?
A:  Through the junction system. The junction system is a system that 
    could enfuse magic to your character's atttributes, hence making 
    them stronger. See Basic Tutorial for more information. BTW, the
    effects of Junction are affected by the following:
    . Number of magic: The more you have, the better the effect of the
      junction system.
    . Types of spell: The stronger the spell you have, the better the
      effect the junction has on the character.
    Junction also allows your characters to equip commands and 
    abilities. There is no accessories/armor in the game. Please read
    the Basic Tutorial thoroughly. You need to have junction abilities
    [i.e. abilities that are ended with "-J"] for boosting your 
    character's statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How do I upgrade my weapons in FF8?
A:  You can't buy new weapons instead you can tune them up through Junk
    Shops. But in order to do this, you need to have specific 
    ingredients such as M-Stone Piece, Sharp Spike, Dragon Fang, etc.
    Of course, not everything in the world is free. You need to pay a
    small sum to upgrade them to new models [you can choose to upgrade
    or downgrade.] Everytime you attempt to remodel the weapon, the 
    ingredients will be used up. If you want to upgrade back to the 
    same weapon, you need to get new ingredients. To upgrade a weapon in
    Disc 4, just get GF Doomtrain [Call Junk Shop menu ability] and do
    the following:
    1) Activate your menu.
    2) Select the Ability header.
    3) Select Call Junk Shop
    4) Do what you normally do at Junk Shops.
    It's pretty simple huh? BTW, don't try to force your way in the 
    towns, as it is impossible!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. How I mug an item?
A:  This one is pretty hard to explain if you don't know anything about
    junction commands or abilities. First of all, you need to get a GF
    ability called "Mug" [from Bahamut or Diablos, requires 200 AP to
    master]. Next equip GF Bahamut or Diablos with the mastered Mug 
    ability. After you have equipped the commands, you will be able to
    select the type of character/party abilities. Choose Mug and add it
    to one of the ability slots. If you equip the ability, you should 
    see the attack command is being replaced with Mug. If that happens,
    you are on the right track.
    Just go to a random battle and look for the monster that you want
    to steal an item from. Remember to watch for the top status bar 
    after your character has performed the attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. How do I junctioned commands?
A:  Before I start this, I need to explain that GFs are extremely 
    important as they worked like Materia in FF7. Without them, you 
    can't have other commands besides attack. First of all, you need to 
    get a GF. [If you have seen through the ability list in Part II, you
    should noticed that all the 16 GFs have Magic, GF and Draw.]

    To equip a command, do the following step-by-step and make sure that
    you are in the main menu.
    1) Select Junction from the main menu
    2) Select the character who you want to junction GFs with.
    3) Select Junction command from the Junction Menu. Select the GFs
       that you want to equip with. Press Triangle once you are done.
    4) You should be brought to the Auto screen if you have magic in 
       that character's magic inventory. Choose either Atk, Def or Mag.
       If your character don't have any magic, you will be brought to
       the Ability sub-menu directly. Press Triangle once you are done.
    5) At the ability screen, you should see the command list of the
       character with the slots along with ability slots. On the right
       is the list of commands available (if the cursor is pointing at
       either one of the three command slots, they are found under the
       Attack command) and list of abilities available (if the cursor
       is pointing at either one of ability slots.) Just pick and choose
       from the list. Duplicate commands will only appear once. [For
       example, as I had mentioned earlier, that all 16 GFs have the 3
       basic commands, GF, Magic and Draw. These commands will appear 
       only once even if you have more than 1 GFs equipped.] Press
       Triangle once you are done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. Where do General Caraway go after he had brought you to the Gateway?
A: It is pretty funny that I got such e-mails more than twice ^_^;). 
   After Caraway have move away from the Gateway, head towards the left
   side of the screen. You should be brought to the front screen where
   you see crowds and the gateway. Notice that there is no people on the
   left side of the crowd. Just walk down and exit from the screen. You
   will meet Caraway there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. Who is Squall's father?
A: This may be a piece of spoiler [heck, anyway by typing out the FAQ,
   I had already spoiled the game...]. There is my evidence to support
   that Laguna Loire is Squall's father!

   A) If you re-visit Winhill, you will found out that the photo of the
      family (Laguna, Raine, "Squall" and Ellone) is missing. The photo
      is found at Raine's House [next to the pub]
   B) Laguna has probably left Squall in the hands of Edea before 
      leaving for his journey to rescue Ellone. You had see sequences of
      Squall standing in the rain feeling bored and Laguna talking to
      Edea... (btw, this may be wrong as it is my own assumption)
   C) If you talk to Ward or Kiros, you make get more information leaked
      out about Squall and Laguna [that's a pretty good hint by the 
      way...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. Have you heard any rumours about FF8?
A:  Definitely yes! Of course, FF8 is such a great RPG and there are 
    also have some loopholes just like FF7 and so you can expect some
    rumours about the game.

 A) Getting Cloud Strife
    Well, I myself is also a fan of Cloud. But I don't have sufficient
    proof that Cloud is in the game. But based on gameshark, it is not
    possible to have Cloud. This always works btw. But here are some 
    rumours [they seems a bit reasonable...]
    1) Have 16 gameovers at the Island closest to Hell. Upon the 16th
       continue, Cloud will appear... 
       My Reply: This is definitely not true!
    2) During the battle against the Iron Clad [the BOSS at the missile
       base], you can mug an item from the BOSS which allows you to
       summon Cloud Strife! [Cloud will appears and do his Omnislash
       Limit Break!]
       My Reply: Haven't tested it yet as my party was too strong...
       I have killed that stupid Iron Clad with a few attacks...

 B) Getting GF Griever/ a hidden GF
    You can get GF Griever in Lunatic Pandora. You must have all the
    weapons, 666 items or something to that nature. Also in Balamb, 
    next to Zell's house, an old man makes reference to an old story/
    legend.
    My Reply: 
    . About the ridiculous 666 item:
      This isn't true as it is impossible to have 666 of an item type.
      So give up your hopes... [That 666 items requirement is actually
      taken from Occult Fan III, which refers to GF Doomtrain ^_^; If
      you break the numbers up along with other issues, you should get
      6x Steel Pipes, 6x Malboro Tentacles, 6x Remedy+]
    . An old man...
      Well, I guessed this may be partly right... I'm not sure about
      this anyway. But since half of the rumour is wrong, it is just
      as good as the rumour is false.

C)  Getting Seifer after Dollet Mission
    I know that there will be a lot of Seifer's fan hoping that this 
    could be true. Well, I have recently received a rumour regarding
    this...

Luckily for us, FAQ writers for FF8, Rinoa did not die in the game...
Otherwise we may be facing problems like resurrecting Rinoa... *Phew*
I have excluded some of rumours to save me from e-mails probing...
BTW, here is a point of advice from me and that is don't be cheated by
rumours. (Provided that there is sufficient proof to prove it... at 
least a screenshot of the rumour. Like showing Cloud fighting against
any monster that's included in FF8.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. Why can't I equip Card Mod-RF on my character?
A:  You can't equipped that on a character. There are several types of
    abilities and below is a short summary on the abilities types:

    Type         How to use it?
    Character    You need to equip it to enable its effect. Go to
                 Junction menu and choose the fourth tab, Abilities.
    GF           Automatically takes effect once the GF has mastered
                 the ability. Note that the learnt ability only applies
                 to that GF, which has the ability in its slot.
    Junction     It allows some of the Junction options to be enable on
                 the Junction status screen. For example, if the
                 equipped GFs does not have any Str-J, the Str option
                 will be greyed out. There is no need to equip the 
                 ability, just equiped GF to enable its effect.
    Menu         One of the abilities that can't be equipped. You can
                 access this ability under Ability sub-menu of the main
                 menu. [Card Mod-RF is a type of menu ability]
    Party        Same as character ability, need to equip, followed the
                 same method as character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. Is it possible to defeat the BOSS at lower levels compared to the
    statistics that you have given in the FAQ?
A:  Of course, you don't need to go to that extreme ^_^;). This is one
    of the reasons which makes FF8 different from FF7. Monsters, 
    including BOSSES get level up as your characters level up [in 
    proportion to Squall's level.], which means the higher Squall's
    level is, the more HP or level will be the BOSS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. How do I get Mog's Amulet?
A:  This is one time that can only be achieved by playing the Choco
    World. Besides, I have stressed on this many times...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. How do I get more Rosetta Stones?
A:  To get more Rosetta Stones, you can either use the refinement method
    or search method. Rosetta Stones can be refined using a Menu 
    Ability. [please refer to Menu abilities, FF8 Part II FAQ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. How do I get Zell's Armageddon Fist?
A:  This is actually a move that invented by one of FF8 gamers, Kaze
    Yagami [beats me why everyone choose to use to this name...]. It is
    actually a chain between Punch Rush, Booya, Punch Rush, Booya....
    [I guess you should know that flow...]. It is named this, because of
    its killing effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. How do I exit from Ultimecia's Castle in Disc 4?
A:  A simple analogy... How do you exit from your home? Of course,
    through the door! or the window [unless you are Spiderman or theft,
    otherwise I have no comments ^_^]. Just go back to the main hall
    and exit the door. Go to the chain and choose any of the doors to
    get back to the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. Must I followed the story sequence based on the walkthrough?
A:  YES! All except for World Tours [or sub-quest which other FAQ 
    writers call it.]. If you don't follow in order, like going to 
    Galbadia Garden before you have finished up with Timber story
    sequence, you will find Galbadia Soldiers surrounding the building.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
38. Does Ultimecia's castle contains every single enemy?
A:  YES! You can find virtually all the monsters that is available in
    the game. But some of them don't appear that frequently like 
    Malboros, Tonberries and Elynoles. I have managed to encounter an
    Elynole on my trip up the clock tower...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
39. When and where is the best place to level up all your characters?
A:  It depends only on your character current level. IMO, I guess it is
    best not to stress on your character's current level, as certain 
    enemies are really a killer even it is only a level 15 monsters.
    The area where you get most EXP is from the enemies in the Island
    closest to Hell and Heaven, don't know where it is? Refer to the
    maps found at my website <http://risland.virtualave.net>!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. No Alexander, No Doomtrain? --> Getting Remedy +
A:  Getting Doomtrain is one of hardiest feature in FF8, you need to get
    in pursuit of items and met its requirement to get it. First of all,
    you need to get all the requirements of 6x Steel Pipes, 6x Malboro
    Tentacles and 6x Remedy+ (!). After gotten the requirements, use 
    the item "Solomon's Ring" to get GF Doomtrain. The key link between
    Alexander and Doomtrain is the requirement of Remedy+. If you don't
    have Remedy+, you can't get GF Doomtrain. To get Remedy+, you need
    to use Med LV Up [menu ability] to convert 60x Remedy [which can be
    bought from shops]. As for the other requirements, please refer to
    the walkthrough or FF8 FAQ Part II.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. Gilgamesh interrupted my fight against Adel and kill Rinoa!
A:  One comments: The gamer is really unlucky ^_^;) You really needs to
    depend on luck and pray hard that Gilgamesh does not appear.
    Actually, IMO, I guess you need to make sure that at least one of
    members has most of the HP as this reduces the appearance of
    Gilgamesh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. How to get back Odin after I have gotten Gilgamesh?
A:  Sorry pals, as there is no way to get back Odin after Gilgamesh...
    Odin is already killed in half by Seifer in the battle at Lunatic
    Pandora [Disc 3], that's why Odin can never appear, beside its
    sword is already taken by Gilgamesh ^_^; so how is it going to 
    attack? Besides in FF8, there is no lance for Odin...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. How does the Rare Item takes it effect?
A:  It is one of doubts which still remains a mystery for me... 
    Typically, Rare Item is party ability and takes effect after you
    have finished the random battles and just increase the "chances" [
    I don't how it was being measured, but according to my gameplay, it
    seems to give me more GF type items and rarer items, but decreases
    the rate of junk items (which is more cheaper...)]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. Why I have never found Selphie's Limit Break <The End>?
A:  IMO, you need to take a lot of patience in getting this. The End
    appears about 1 out of 100 tries while using the Slots. You need to
    press "Do over" [1st option] and switch and switch... until you
    found the spell... But if you miss it, it WILL take you more longer
    to find it again in next try! Besides you can't use The End at your
    will since it is an instant killer spell!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
45. Is it possible to complete the game without all GFs?
A:  Of course, the completion of the game depends on your will. If you
    want to have an easy fight, I would recommend you to get all GFs. In
    other words, it is not necessary to get all GFs to complete the
    game. The aim of this walkthrough is just to give you a clearer
    picture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Notes
Things can't be done without a gameshark/pocketstation:
- Get Apocalypse magic before the fight against True form of Ultimecia.
- Get another Magical Lamp besides the one you get it from Cid.
- Get Ribbon/Mog's Amulet/Friendship item.
- Rare GF Abilities such as Supt Mag-RF, Discount, Awarness, etc.

Things that never can be done...
- Enter towns in Disc 4
- Find the gateways to the chain road in front of Ultimecia's Castle 
  before Disc 4.
- Find the white SeeD Ship after you return from space visit.
- Read the Girl Next Door (it is a junk item...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, let's proceed onto this epic RPG journey..

Introduction - Story of Final Fantasy VIII                    ffviii_005
========================================================================

My personal review of FF8
--------------------------
Well before I begin the speech.. I have 5 words to say "Final Fantasy
VIII is great!". Indeed it is great.. for those whom can stand long
time training, I guess your opinion will be different. As I gotten my
US copy on the 10th of September, I was very eager to play and the game
was simply a fantastic piece of work. As you guys know that I have 
replay this game more than 10 times for Japanese version, I have managed
to did it for the NA version. The only key in completing the game, is
your determination in stocking of spells, training and best of all, 
attention. The script of FF8 is really exciting and a couple of humorous
jokes from characters. It also shows the development of characters in
the game. The Junction System is easy to learn for NA version as there
are online tutorials about it! The draw system seems a bit tiring but it
is worth the try. There are also a couple of things that I did not try 
out in the Japanese version, such as getting Occult Fan III and Occult
Fan IV, the bone quest at Dollet, recovering lost GFs, Zell's love quest,
Obel Lake's Mystery at Morded Plains, Chocobo Forest Quests and much 
more. Here are the ratings of the categories:

Storyline: 9 /10 - it is really great! 
Graphics: 7.5/10 - the graphics is not too nicely rendered unlike those
                   PC screenshots as compared to the PSX screenshots.
Music 7.5/10 - the soundtrack is nice and fantastic. Especially, Faye 
               Wong's Eyes on Me!
Game Play 7/10 - The Junction system is really good, if you managed to
                 understand. There are sub quests such as the card game,
                 chocobo forests, UFO.... more than 10 hours of leisure.
                 For those whom own the Pocketstation, you can get to
                 enjoy the Chocobo World sub quest..
Overall: 8.0 /10 - it really deserves it...
Learning Curve: Medium - quite hard.. Otherwise, I don't have to come up
                with such a long FAQ...

/ 1.3 \_________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between Japanese Version and English Version
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the changes that I have found after completing the game. There 
are rather a lot of changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Control Configuration Changes
   Affects: All Discs
I was really frustrated when I keep on pressing Circle while there is
no response.. then I refer to my manual and I was really bluffed.. It 
is X that is the action button (p:). You can find new control 
configuration in the next section

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Online-Tutorial
   Affects: Disc 1 only
Well, I guess Online Tutorials only last until Disc 1 ^_^;. You will be
given Tutorials about junctioning, Squall's Renzokuken, Zell's Duel,
Rinoa's Limit Breaks, Elemental Arts, Status Magic Junction, etc. It 
will be rather nice to pay attention to them.. if you are too lazy,
Section 2.0 should answer most of your questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. New name inputs
   Affects: Disc 1 only
You can only change the names of these two characters.. Squall, Rinoa
and her dog Angelo. You will be allow to input the following letterings

- English (well, if you don't understand this, you won't be able to read
  the FAQ ^_^;)
- Symbols 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. New Icons..
   Affects: All Discs
This rather interesting.. Icons are used to represent elementals shown
by the Scan Analyse Screen and also there is a lot more changes in the
GF menu icons. For example, in the Japanese version, the icon for 
Junction Ability represented by "J" however it is represented by a 
"UP" for the US. Fortunately the icons for items remain unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. New colouring for Gerogero 
   Affects: All Discs
Well, if you are observant enough (like me..), you will noticed that
the colour of this monster, Gerogero (the monster that Fake President
has morphed into) has changed from red to blue.. this also applies its
cards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. No more bugs for Centra Ruins.
   Affects: All Discs
Hmm, this is good if you are very frustrated in getting the Odin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Different draw spells at different areas...
   Affects: All Discs
There are too many to emulate.. For example, in the Japanese version,
you can get to draw Life from the draw point found in the main 
compound of Centra Ruins. Now instead, you will draw Drain from it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Junction Bug doesn't exist for North American version
   Affects: All Disc.
Well, as the discs are free of bugs and it makes sense that it does not
exists. ^_^;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Re-Draw of GFs at Ultemicia Castle
   Affects: Disc 4
If you have forgetten to get the GFs that obtained through this method,
you can re-draw them back in Ultemicia's Castle. Great if you want to 
get Eden from a easier boss, Tiamat instead of the Ultima Weapon.

What is their purpose?

** Strength **
This factor affects the attacking power of your character. The higher 
the stats, the more damage your character will inflict with the Attack 
Command.

** Vitality **
This factor effects the defensive power of your character. The higher 
the defensive stats, the lesser the amount of damage inflicted by your
opponent.

** Magic **
This factor effects the magic attacking power of your character. The
higher the stats, the more damage your character will inflict when 
using magic. 

** Spirit **
This factor effects the magic defensive power of your character. The 
higher the stats, the lesser the amount of damage inflicted by your
opponent when it uses magic. 

** Speed **
This factor effect the speed of your time bar or ATB (also known
Active Time Bar). The higher the stats, the faster the ATB is.

** Evasion/ Evade **
This factor effect the rate whether your character will escape from an
enemy's attack [causing a MISS in the opponent's attack]. The higher
the stats, the more chance your character will dodge from an attack.

** Hit **
This factor effect the rate whether your character will hit your 
opponent with the Attack Command. The higher the stats, the lesser 
chance that your character will miss an attack. Gunblades have 255%
hit rate.

** Luck **
This one I not quite sure. But I think that it will effect the rate 
whether the Odin will appear. It also effect the rate whether your
character could escape from status ailments such as death. If you have
the luck stats of 100+, you will be able to see the Gilgamesh in 
between battles! I guess it also affects the critical hit rates.

** Status Attack **
This is similar to FF7's Elemental combo on your character's weapon
Your character will inflict damage and also causes status ailments 
on your opponent. For example if you want to cause Sleep with your
character attack, junction Sleep to your Status Attack with ST-Atk-J.
The above-mentioned combo is the key to survive for this game.

** Status Defense **
I myself preferred this than status attack. This works like FF7's 
Elemental combo on your character's armor. Your character will receive 
protection against the status that you have junctioned. For example if 
you want your character to be protected against Confuse, junction 
Confuse to your status defense (ST-Def-J)

** Elemental Attack **
This is rather USELESS. If you want to do more damage against Fire-
based monsters such as the Bomb, junction Blizzard to your junction as 
Blizzard works well against Fire. However, ice-based monsters will 
nullifies the attack, thus you are helping them to restore lost HP! 
The Elem-Atk is pretty helpful if you know about the BOSS beforehand.

** Elemental Defense **
This is much preferred against Elemental Attack. As you can received no
damage from elementals or nullifies it and restore your HP. This 
ability could make your life easier. If you junction 100x Ultima to your 
Elemental defense, you will be able to nullify any kind of magic. For
example if you want your character to protect well against Fire, 
junction Fire to the character's Elemental Defense. (Elem-Def-J)

Well, since you already know what the abbreviations stands for, I will
now proceed to the sub-menu headings

Occasionally, if you junction 100x of a spell to the characters' 
attributes defense, you will see a green-colour star. This marks that
the spell being cast on the equipped character will be absorbed. A
green star marks 100% protection against the spell [which means it does
0 HP damage.] Over 100% will instantly absorb the spell.

Thanks to fuuie for his precise guide on magic junctioning.

R e m o v e
----------------------------------------------------------------------0 

<Mag> 
Removes all the spells are set using the Junction Menu. Your character
stats will change back to it's original. The numbers of the stats also
decreases. You will be given a message box, if you have junctioned 
magic to the character's maximum HP through HP-J.

<All>
Removes all equipped Commands [GF command, Magic command, Item command, 
Draw command, GFs command such as Recover set that is by using the 
Junction Option. And of course the magic spells that are junction to 
your character's stats. It removes the equipped GFs. This option works
well when you want to transport all GFs to another character.

A u t o       
----------------------------------------------------------------------0

<Atk>   
Optimises the spells by configuring according to the attacking power.
The character's attacking stats are the highest by using the best 
spells to Str-J (if available)

<Mag>
Optimises spells for the highest magic attack and defense. Junction
better magic [also giving you better results] to the Mag-J (if
available)

<Def>
Optimises spells for highest defensive power. Junction the better magic 
[also giving you better results] to the character's Vit-J (if available)

A b i l i t y
----------------------------------------------------------------------0
 
This option is the only way to configure what other actions, that your
character could perform besides the normal attacks and special attacks.
Once you have equipped a GF, you will have 4 four commands being set.
Here is the list of "Basic" commands [all GFs have it and mastered 
them!]

<Magic>
It allows your characters to cast the spells that you have drawn from 
opponents or Draw Points. BTW, you must have the draw command in order
to draw magic!

<GF>
It allows you to summon the Guardian Forces. There you will see the HP
of the GF replacing the HP of the commanding character. There is a 
time bar in blue. The monster will automatically being summoned as all
the blue bar has been used up. This can be cancel if the monster's HP 
reaches zero, being under Confuse/Silence/Sleep/Berserk status.

<Draw>
|One of the most important commands used in the game. With this command,
|you can "draw" magic such as Fire, Fira and much more from enemies. 
|NOTE: You must have this command in order to draw magic from the Draw
|      Points [purple translucent bubbles]. 
|----[Stock]
|Saves the magic for later use. Up to the maximum number of 9 spells 
|that can be drawn, this will depend on the level of your opponent, the
|level of your character and your luck. It will work better if you tap
|X repeatedly (it works for me..)
|
|----[Cast]
|One charge can be drawn in this way, but the spell will immediately
|expelled. The spell is being used at half of the damage. But this 
|situation is good for if you want to cast a spell that you have not
|drawn before. There is a high possibility of failure for you to draw 
|hidden spells from enemies.

<Item>
It allow you to use items such as Potions, Phoenix Downs when engaged
in combat. These are pretty handy when your character is unable to use
magic [e.g. being silenced]. Also allow you to summon some special
monsters or guardian forces such as the Phoenix and Moomba.

For the usage of other commands, refer to Part II for more details.

The Basic Junctioning of Commands.
----------------------------------
This is rather similar compared to the Japanese version. It is just that
I have illustrated in a simpler manner. After you have firstly selected
the desired GF to junction with, press Triangle and you will be brought
to the Auto screen [if you have magic]. Press Triangle again and you 
will be brought to Ability Screen and it should look something like 
ASCII art below. Please note that all the list of abilities are not the
permanent list as you can alter the abilities using Amnesia Greens.

The Basic Junctioning of Abilities
----------------------------------
Here you will find the abilities lists. I have decided to add an ASCII
diagram to make my explanation easier. On the list, you will find ALL
the characters' abilities (c) and party abilities (p) that is found
within the GFs EQUIPPED. There is however one special ability that you
need to take note of... Mug. This ability will causes the "Attack" to
be changed to "Mug" as shown below. If you disarm "Mug" and you will 
find that the "Mug" has switched back to "Attack".

There is other notes of these abilities. You will find these abilities
appear on the right-hand side of the slots if the cursor is pointing at
any of the ability slots.

Items apparently are one of the most important factors in FF8. They 
will help you to restore HP, cure status disorder and helps in battles,
allow GFs to learn new abilities, get GFs etc. I have classified them 
into six major groups

MEDICINE : Healing items such as Potions, Phoenix Downs and Elixirs.

JUNK     : Items such as M-Stone Piece, Magic Stone and Screws.
           These items cannot be use through the item command, however
           some of them provide some Limit Breaks for Quistis. These
           items are also important for Weapon Upgrading. They can also 
           refine into magic through Magic Refinement Menu Abilities
           like T-Mag RF. You can't view items such as Naughty Magazine
           as it is a junk item.

GF       : Item used in restoring GF's lost HP or Life and allows GFs
           to learn new abilities. Provide that you have enough space..

BATTLE   : Items that are only useable through the item command. One
           good example is the Gyshal Greens.

FIELD    : Items that are group-based type, and only useable at Save
           Points, examples are Tents, Pet Houses and Cottages.

BOOKS    : Useful booklets which tells you requirements on Weapon
           Upgrading, new moves for Rinoa and new moves for Zell. Press
           X to view them. 

AMMO     : These items are only use battles through Irvine's Limit
           Break, Shot. Most of them can be gotten through Ammo-RF

Drawing a full ASCII Art of the Item menu requires time, so I have only
draw out the Tool Bar.

Diagram 2.2F: Item Menu
  __________________________________________________________________
 |   Use        Rearrange         Sort          Command  | Item     |
 |_______________________________________________________|__________|

<Use>
This will enable you to use the items directly from the item menu. 
Only healing items such as Potions can be used from here. You can also
view books, activate the item, Magical Lamp to fight the Diablos from 
here! To summon GF Doomtrain, use the Solomon's Ring through this 
command. [make sure you have met the requirements. You can also use 
items to let Quistis to learn special moves, improve GF compatibility
by using GF compatibility items, upgrade character's stats with Str Ups
and allows you to view booklets like Occult Fan I ~ IV.

<Rearrange>
Allow you to arrange the items in your preferred way. Doing this 
will be much easier while in searching for the items that you
wished to use. You can arranged the items by switching places and
placing them in a blank space. There are about 25 item pages.

<Sort>
This will cause the computer to arrange the items. Useable and 
important ones will be the top of the menu, while those unusable ones 
will be arranged at the lower section. Practically it is arranged in 
this order:

[MEDICINE]-[GF]-[BATTLE]-[FIELD]-[AMMO]-[JUNK]-[BOOKS]

<Command>
This section allows you to arrange what you want to appear at the 
item pages [through item commands] Allows you to arrange the items
in your own preference. Well looks something like this:
 ________________________
|ITEM P1            NUM. |   To change it's position, just simply 
|Potion             100  |   the item on the top left screen and select
|Phoenix Down       20   |   another item [the spot where you want to
|Remedy             6    |   place the first item] There are about 10
|Gyshal Greens      1    |   pages for items. You can use stones such
|________________________|   as Holy Stone as you are casting Holy!

Magic apparently is an important factor in battles. Magic does decent
amount of damage and some does massive amount of damage to a group of
enemies, e.g. the Ultima Magic. Well, here is the ASCII Toolbar of the

<Use>
Allows you to use magic from the menu directly. NOTE: You can't use 
attacking magic such as Thunder, Fira, Blizzaga, Aero, Ultima, Protect,
etc. You can only use all healing magic except for Regen. Usable magic 
will have white-colour fonts. 

<Exchg>
|Allows you to trade magic even a particular member is not currently in
|your present party. There are a total of 3 commands from this section
|
|----[Give All]
|Gives all the amount of a particular magic from an existing character 
|to the selected character in the lower row. Firstly select your 
|character and then select the magic spell you want to trade and then 
|select the character you want to give to and select the space where 
|you want to put the magic [All the amount of the current magic will be
|given to the other character, e.g. If Squall has 3 Cure magic and you
|trade Cure with Quistis, Quistis will have all the 3 Cure magic]
|REMOVE MAGIC!!! by Mark Andrews. Press Square to move the whole stack.
|Note: upon removing the magic, you can't get them back!
|
|----[Take All]
|Gives the top character to receive the amount of a particular spell 
|from the character at the bottom row. E.g. Squall is the top character, 
|and Quistis is the lower character. Select Quistis and the spell you 
|want to trade to Squall. Squall will have all the selected spell that
|Quistis originally has.
|
|----[Split]
 A better command. This option allows you to specify the number of magic
 that each of the character will receive. It is NOT necessary for that
 character to have that spell in his/her own magic inventory. Press UP
 to increase and DOWN to decrease.

<All>
Allows the above character to receive all the magic from the bottom
character. Very useful if you want to transfer all the spells from a 
character whom isn't in your party to the other character. Well, I 
simply love this as it save you the trouble for getting magic for ALL
characters and you need to get magic for ONLY three characters. Save
50% of your time.

<Rearrange>
A very common command used in arranging placing your magic in order for
easy access during combat. Each character has 8 magic pages for Magic.
To remove magic, press Square to discard it! [you will remove the entire
lot..]

Fire          :   Fire magic is weak against Fire-based monsters,
                  but is good against Cold/Ice/Water-based monsters.
Ice           :   Ice magic is weak against Cold/Ice/Water-based 
                  monsters, but is pretty good against Fire-based 
                  monsters.
Thunder       :   Thunder elemental is weak against Thunder-based
                  monsters, but great against mechanical beasts. Well,
                  common sense, you will get electric shock as metal
                  conducts electricity.
Earth         :   Earth elemental is useless against flying creatures
                  but great against standing opponents except for 
                  Earth-based monsters.
Poison        :   Poison elemental is useless against mechanical beast
                  but great against humans except for Poison-based 
                  monsters.
Wind          :   Wind elemental is great against flying creatures, 
                  but weak against wind-based monsters. Sometimes,
                  Wind does not work well against flying creatures
                  like Thrustaveis
Water         :   Water elemental is great against monsters located
                  at desert and mechanical beasts. Water works well 
                  against Fire-based monster.
Holy          :   Holy elemental works well against the undead ["false
                  HP"]. Cure is an example of Life/Holy Magic. If you 
                  junction this to your character's Elemental Attack..
                  heee....

Status Disorder Chart
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death:         Your character will be killed instantly, HP drops to
               zero. Very damaging. Instant KO Status
Poison:        A green cloud appears on head of your character. HP 
               drops in chunks as the character reaches his turn. This
               status aliment also occurs in the field and the battle.
Petrify:       The character becomes a solid stone and ATB stops [which
               means that you can't used that character.] Game over if
               all characters are petrified.
Darkness:      A black cloud surrounds the forehead of your character.
               Your character will misses his/her attacks frequently.
               Hit rate decreases tremendously.
Silence:       A tiny bubble speech that says "..." Your character can
               only use Attack Command and the GF's Abilities Command.
Berserk:       Steam rushes out from the red-hot character. You will 
               lost the control of the effected character as the 
               character just attacked with the ATTACK command.
Zombie:        The affected character will turn greenish and becomes an
               undead and causes them to be weak against healing magic
               or life magic.
Sleep:         The character's ATB will stop and "zzzz" appears from 
               the character. The character will only awake when under
               attack or a Remedy or Esuna is used on him/her
Curse:         The colour of the character darkens and thus ATB bar 
               slows down. [There isn't any magic that you can junction
               to your Elementals attack, that's reason why this status
               is being left. Cast Aura to remove the status ailments.
               It also prevents your character from using his/her
               Limit Breaks.
Slow:          The ATB gauge [or known as the Time Bar] moves slower,
               changing purple in colour. [about at 1/2 the time of the
               regular ATB..]
Stop:          The ATB gauge freezes as the effected character stopped
               moving [even the super hyperactive Zell stops shaking!]
Confuse:       Your character turns around in circles and will attack
               your party even himself/herself!
Drain:         Finally found the usage. This depends on character's
               defense against life drain attacks.

GF stands for Guardian Forces. Guardians are just the summoned monsters 
from FF7 and FFT [Final Fantasy Tactics]. They possesses powerful and 
devastating magic. Use them wisely. There is a difference between FF7 
and FF8 is that now summoning a guardian will requires time as a blue 
bar will overleap your present time bar and the HP of the Guardian will 
be covering the character's HP. Last of all, summoning a monster does 
not required to use MP anymore! Select your monsters and this will 
lead to the Learn sub-menu.

<Learn>
|As you battles, you will gain AP, which is mentioned in Part II. AP is
|similar to FFT's job points, which allows you, gain when the job is

For this section, you will be able to view the card. The card origins 
from a psychic called Orlan where they will be able to play cards. To 
know more about the rules, refer to Part II or the Tutorial Section.

BTW, here is a brief idea explaination of the Triple Triad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott's Explaination on the card game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective of the Card Game: To own as many cards as possible

Accessories:                Each player requires a minimum of 5 cards to
                            start a card game. Next press Square button 
                            to talk to a person to play a card game. 

The card game is being played on 3 squares by 3 squares board [i.e. a 
total of 9 squares]. The objective is turn over the opponent's card to
your side. To do this, your card's attacking number must be larger as
compared to your opponents' defending number. Each card contains 4 
numbers, and the numbers ranged from 1 to A. However as you can into 
later part of the game, you experience intermediate rules being added to
the card game, and the game will become much tougher, refer to FAQ 
Part II, where details of the card game are being explained in detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [a]        [b]
 _______   _______      Let's says Card [b] is the attacking card.[i.e.
|   9   | |   9   |     second card to be placed on the 3x3 board] As
| 8   5 | | 7   2 |     the left number of card [b] (which is number 7)
|   1   | |   3   |     is greater/bigger than card [a]'s number 5. 
|_______| |_______|     Well, if you don't understand a dime of what I
                        am talking, let's zoom into the focus:
 DEFENSE   ATTACK
 ______    ______
|      |  |      |      Clear? As you see the attack side's no. 7 is
|    5 |  | 7    |      definately larger than 5. Remember that in FF8,
|      |  |      |      the largest is A [which represents 10] and the
|______|  |______|gamga     smallest is 1. 

SCENARIO A
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _______                BTW, take note on how the attacking is done. 
|   9   |    [a]        You can attack the side from four directions 
| 8   5 |  DEFENSE      based on where the defending card is being 
|   1   |               placed.
|_______|               Note the numbers that are involved in this
 _______                scenario. It's card [a]'s 1 and card [b]'s 9.
|   9   |               Simple huh?
| 7   2 |    [b]        I guessed you may think what will happened if 
|   3   |  ATTACK       the SCENARIO C happens? Will Card [b] be able to
|_______|               turn the card over?

SCENARIO B
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [b]       [a]        Before I begin my explaination, which are the
 ATTACK    DEFENSE      cards that you should be focus on? 
 _______   _______      [a] 2 & 8   [b]  9 & 9   [c] 7 & 5
|   9   | |   9   |
| 7   2 | | 8   5 |     It is card [b]'s 2 and card [a]'s 8. 
|   3   | |   1   |     For this case, no cards will be flipped over!
|_______| |_______|     Unless [b] is defending card [if this happens
                        [b] will turn over to [a]'s side.]

You can now change your settings during the game, but NOT during 
battles, except for ON/OFF the vibration if you have a Dual Shock
controller. Here is the section down the list:

1.  Sound:           You can switch between Stereo and Mono
2.  Controller:      You can set the settings on Normal [default] or 
                     Customize [assign the buttons by yourself]
3.  Cursor:          Cursor is automatically being placed at the last
                     command. [Initial or Memory]
4.  ATB:             Switch between [Active] where they flow normally 
                     or [Wait] where the time bar stops automatically 
                     while selecting a command.
5.  Scan:            Choosing the second option, the labeller will 
                     appear for those monsters/enemies that have been 
                     labelled once.
6.  Camera Movement: Allows you to regulate from 0 % to 100 %. Higher 
                     percentage, the better the camera view is.
7.  Battle Speed:    Regulates the speed of the battle.
8.  Battle Message:  Regulates the speed of messages during battle.
9.  Field Message:   Regulates the speed of messages during on the field.
10. Analog Input:    Regulates the reaction speed of the stick input
11. Vibration:       Turns the vibration ON/OFF (applies to only Dual
                     Shock controllers.) The controllers vibrates when
                     you are summoning GFs. It is feeling good to have a
                     message.

Bonus Edition                                                  ffviii_PC
------------------------------------------------------------------------
After several days of pondering, I have finally made up my mind to add
this section for the PC version of FF8 users. BTW, these information are
gathered from PC users. If you need help about the PC version, you can
contact them [see Contributor list for their e-mail address]

2.4a)   Minimum system requirements
Below are the minimum system requirements [of course, it is highly 
advisible that your PC specifications are better.]. Otherwise, you will
find the game running at extremely slow speed.

Window 95/98 Compatible System
Intel or 100% Compatible CPU
Pentium 200 [Pentium II 266 recommended]
32MB RAM [64MB recommended]
8MB 3D Accelerator Graphics Card [16MB recommended]
8x CD-ROM
Direct 6.1 [Included]
DirectSound and DirectMusic compatible sound card

More information about PC version
Note that the PC version contains the "Choco World" Pocketstation 
sub-game. It contains about 5 discs (hopefully, my memory isn't that 
bad.) One is for installing the game and the remaining 4 discs are 
gaming discs. Plus you can have a Calendar for your enjoyment. To
configure your joystick, go to Control Panel and calibrate your game
controller.

Typically the game controls for the FF8 in the PC varies a lot and 
thanks to my fellow pals who has contribute the below information to 
me. The gameplay does not varies with the PSX version btw.

2.4b)    Button Configuration:
Hopefully that I can get this from one of the contributors who got the
PC version of FF8.

2.4c)    Codes for PC version by Vincent Luciano
For these valuable information, thanks to a delicated FF8 gamer, Vincent
Luciano. For the pocketstation, it allows you to duplicate items from 
the Choco World. [BTW, refer to the Choco World section in Part II for
more valuable information]

Code #1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pocketstation Loop Trick
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PC Skills required: Know how to cut, paste and copy using Keyboard
                    and multi-tasking!

Step-by-Step Guidelines:
1) First of all, you need to catch the Mother Chocobo in any of the
   Chocobo Forests. Next access the save screen and sent your Chicobo 
   to the Choco World. You may need to refer to Part II or any other of
   Pocketstation FAQs found in GameFAQs. (http://www.gamefaqs.com)

2) Play Choco World! Run around with your Chicobo, kill some monsters,
   and collect AT LEAST ONE of each type of items (a couple of them 
   would be quite fine.)

3) After you are done with your collection, quit the game. Next go to 
   your FF8 Save directory. [well, this one requires you to use the
   Windows Explorer]. There you'll see a file named CHOCORPG. Make a 
   BACKUP COPY of that file to a new directory, or other place you 
   prefer. [To do that, press Ctrl + C to copy that file, next switch
   to another directory and press Ctrl + V to paste the file in 
   another directory.]

4) Now re-run FF8. Import/move your Chicobo back to FF8 World. You'll 
   received the items you've collected so far. Then, send the Chicobo 
   BACK to Chocobo World.

5) Press Alt+Tab to switch back to Windows environment. Now, REPLACE 
   the CHOCORPG file in FF8 save directory with the BACKUP file you 
   created earlier. Just click and drag using Windows Explorer... or
   cut and paste technique. [this is based on your preference.]

6) Press Alt+Tab to switch back to FF8. Access the save screen and 
   move your Chicobo back to FF8 World. Voila! Another set of items! 
   Don't forget to SEND your Chicobo BACK to Chocobo World after 
   getting the items, unless you want to summon the Chicobo in your 
   game.

7) Just repeat Step 5 and 6 for infinite amount of items!

Code #2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pocketstation Loop Trick Upgrade - Easy getting of A class items
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
- Oh boy, you guys better contact Vincent for this...

After reading the trick above, you might think like this: "Hell! This 
A type treasure is hard to come by! It's as hard as getting rare items
in FF8 World!". Well, that's why this upgrade is made.

PC Required Tools:     Hex Editor.
PC Required Knowledge: Hex Editing Related stuffs.

Here's what to do:
+ Make sure you still have at least one item of each type of treasure!
+ Use Hex Editor to open the ChocoRPG file
+ Pay attention to the number of items you have in your possession.
Example:
If you got A 1 B 1 C 3 D 5, then you should search for 01  01  03  05
Then, change it to 20 for each number, so it will turn into this 20 20 
20 20 

For EXPERT Hex Editor, you guys would probably ask: "As I recall, Hex 
number for 20 is 14. So, what's with this number 20?". Well, I've tried
putting alpha numeric digit such as OE, OC, etc and the result is that
the amount of that item will turn into alpha numeric as well. You will
probably get E for A type treause, C for B type treasure and so on. 

Notes from Vincent:
So far, I haven't try changing the amount to 99 because I'm afraid it 
will make the program to crash. If you guys wanna give it a try, go 
ahead,  but don't blame me if you crash your pocketstation. Anyway, 
here's some rare items I get so far via pocketstation:

Aegis Amulet, Status Guard, Dark Matter, Doc's Code, Monk's Code, 
Elem-Atk-J, Spr Up, Mag Up, Friendship, Shaman Stone, Gambler Spirit, 
Hungry Cookpot, Barrier, Hundred Needles, Ribbon, Three Stars, Moon 
Curtain, Steel Curtain, Glow Curtain, Bomb Spirit, Elem Guard, 
LuvLuv G

Notes about PC version
Bugs (gotten from Final Fantasy Online http://www.ffonline.com)
- There are a lot of bugs in PC version of FF8. Bugs included the 
  following:
  - Problem with Yahama Software Synthesizer
  - Crash after NORG battle in Disc 2
  - NVIDIA GeForce video cards
  - EAX compatibility problems
  - card game issues
  - Menu bugs
  - Game Over crashes
  - DirectX 7.0 issues with the Yahama Software Synthesizer
  - Other software related problems

Well, that's summarises why the PC version is that *buggy* and explains
why I got those strange e-mails about the PC version. You can download 
the patch files from the following website:

Final Fantasy Online     http://www.ffonline.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you are ready, let's begin with the walkthrough!
 _____
/ 3.0 \_________________________________________________________________
========================================================================
WALKTHROUGH FOR DISC 1
========================================================================
What a mess, I have created for my previous FAQs. Tons of translations
needed to be corrected. However this FAQ will be a totally different
walkthrough from the previous one! This walkthrough has removed the 
following areas:
- CGIs - someone told me that by describing this spoils the game...

Added the following areas:
- Monster List Bestiary - only list magic to draw and location.
- Items Summary - even there are no treasure chest.. this turn out be
  amazed me! There are tons of items for you collect!
- GF Recruit - so that you will be mentally prepared to get that GFs.
  Now need to read the walkthrough...
- List of Draw Points and Save Points

It was a battle in the morning between our hero, Squall Leonhart and his
rival, Seifer Almasy. Squall got injured in the process as Seifer 
results to a cheap shot.. using magic is not allowed in a battle.

Squall will be lying unconscious at the Infirmary when he was inspected 
by the doctor of Balamb Garden [Dr. Kadowaki]. Dr. Kadowaki will be 
asking Squall whether he is alright or not, pick any one for Squall's 
reply and you will be given a chance to name your character [Squall]. 

* Ok. I guess
* My forehead hurts

After a short conversation, Dr Kadowaki will phone Squall's instructor,
and you will have a CGI introduction of Quistis Trepe (also known as
Instructor Trepe in Balamb) [Pay attention to that sequence.. there is
a girl dressed in blue peeped into the Infirmary]

Guess what? Squall's misfortune fall on the day that he is going for
his SeeD examinations... Squall have to follow her back to the 
classroom. Along the walkway, you will be able to talk to her by 
pressing the X button. Next you will have another CGI ... [it is about
life in Balamb Garden]

Now Squall will be walking to the classroom, noticed how sloppy Squall 
was! At the back row of the classroom, you will see Squall along with 
his rival, Seifer. Quistis will talk to the class that they will begin 
the SeeD final examinations in 1600 hrs time. [The SeeD examinations is 
critical for those who want to be fully pledged SeeD mercenaries] 
After that talk, you will be regaining control of Squall. This time, 
you will be able to view your menu [pressing Circle button]. Now talk 
to Quistis whom is surrounded by a group of students. [that are the
Trepies, hmm.. nice name huh?] She will tell Squall that he needs to go
to the Fire Cavern before he could start his SeeD Examinations. (Squall
intend to go this morning but was challenged by Seifer..) Head back to 
your seat and watch the Tutorial, and tried to get a slight idea on 
how to use the Junction system. [Balamb Garden Network, Tutorial Menu]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
********************* Balamb Garden Network ****************************
========================================================================
                          [Study Panel]
The network was user-friendly and easy to use. Just simply get back to
Squall's desk, pressing X on the study panel and you will be able access 
the student's network. Next pick the first option [Tutorial], and you 
will be able to take your first two Guardian Forces: GF Quezacotl and 
GF Shiva. You will be asked to name the GF and thus being brought to 
the screen where you name your characters. Next you can spend your time 
browsing the other options. Here is an ASCII art of the screen:

After collecting the first two GFs, it is time to equip them. You must
equipped GFs before you can equip any of the basics commands beside 
Attack. To exit the tutorial, simply press Circle and then choose the 
first option. I guess you may need to take a look at the Basic Tutorial
before proceeding on further. 

Now exit the classroom. At the walkway, head south a bit... Squall will 
eventually knocked into a girl (this girl is a future member...) and you 
will given two options
- "Are you OK?"
- ".........."
 
After some chit-chat, you will find out that this girl wants you to take
her a tour around Balamb Garden. She has been just transferred from 
Trabia to here just for Garden School Festival Committee.
- "Sure." - results a tour around Balamb Garden
- "Don't have time" - you navigate Garden yourself 

No matter what choice you have make, it does not affect the game.. Now
walk right.. you will find a man and he will tell you that his brother
has given him some cards... and he will give the 7 cards. (I have list
them up in the headings..). Press Square button to challenge everyone
for the card game.

Now head inside the elevator. The elevator will take you to the 1F of 
the Garden. If you choose option 1, you will have a short sequence about
the explanations of Garden. It is just your first base for your game.
  ____________________________________________________________________

This is the layout of the 1F of the Garden. It is arranged in a hexagon-
shaped structure with passages leading to different areas. There are a 
couple of card players found in this main hall and their appearance is 
random (well because no one can't stand at a spot for too long ^_^:).
Note that you can go to the Training Center [but it will be a bit too 
risky..]. Those colour encoding marked in brackets is actually the 
colour coding on the ground.

[E]    Elevator:           
This will allow Squall to head for the second floor, where you will 
find the classroom. You can also access the Tutorial menu from Balamb
Garden Student Network. 

[L]    Lobby:             
The place where you can find the Directory of Balamb Garden. At the
beginning of the game, there is a Save point near it. Press X to view 
the map. You will always held gatherings with important meetings with
the headmaster, instructors etc. Save Points have also changed its
designs from FF7. To save your game, just proceed to the Save Point.
Tired of walking? Here is the trick (applies for Disc 1 only). Just
simply examine the Directory (or map) and you will find a hand cursor.
Point to the locations that you wished to go..

Now just head for the Central Gate. Refer to the [5] marked on the map.
You will find gates [like when you board a train.] Just simply hold 
forward at the red gate and Squall will knocked open the gate. You will
find the area in front of Garden... Head for the section that is marked
Q on the map. You will find a lady dressed in orange, she is no other
than your instructor, Quistis Trepe. You will have a Tutorial about 
Junctioning GF to your characters. (That's something new. I guess the
reason why Square did not add Tutorials for Japanese version because 
the instructions are in Japanese) Well.. if you want to know more,
check the Tutorial.

G e t t i n g   S t a r t e d ....
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part I

1.1  "Squall's Renzokuken"
When Squall's HP is low (you will see that his stats are coloured (red
or yellow). Tap Circle repeatedly and you will see a tiny blinking
triangle on the right. Press right and you will see this word "Renzoku-
ken". Press X to select it and Squall will use his basic Limit Break.
You will next see boxes.. for you trigger. Press R1 to inflict more
damage. Occasionally you will see Squall using finishing moves like
Rough Divide.

1.2  "Quistis Blue Magic"
Quistis is one of the best characters for her skills works like the
Enemy Skill Materia in FF7. However the learning method is different.
Instead you need to look for items known as "Blue Magic Items" You can
get one from the Caterchipillar [Ultra Waves learned by using the
item, "Spider Web"] There are a lot of items. I will use the following
sign (like one below) to remind you guys:

(Blue Magic: Ultra Waves): Getting Spider Web by defeating the
Caterchipillar. You can get this by stealing or defeating it. (steal
will available after you have gotten Mug Ability)

1.3  "Stocking of Magic"
How to junction commands? Refer to Section 2.2 for more details. 
Junction the "Draw" Command. Now enter a battle and select Draw from
the command. Let's say you decide to draw from the Bite Bug (this 
diagram can be also found in Part II):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ________                                Select Draw command and select
 |Command |                               the spell that you wished to 
 |Attack  |     _______       ________    stock. Next you will see the
 |Magic   |    |Fire  <| --> |Stock   |   box on the extreme right. You
 |GF      |->  |Scan   |     |Cast    |   can choose either one (refer
 |Draw   <|    |_______|     |________|   to Basic Tutorial for more
 |________|                               info. If it is a new spell, it
                                          is marked by "????"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< Drawing Failures >>
You will encounter this frequently for weak magic users like Quistis. 
The situation occurs when either one occurs:
- The monster is being killed and you have selected the Draw command
- A new powerful spell [e.g. Quake, Ultima, Full-Life, Demi]

To counter this situation there are a couple of methods.. here they are:
1. Increase the character's Mag stats through junctioning magic to 
   Mag-J. The powerful and more your stock, the better the effect of the
   Junction [it is really crucial!, you can view a chart of it at Part 
   II]
2. Use items like Mag Up to increase your characters Mag stats. It is
   rather difficult to find, therefore option one is still the best.
3. Have a strong magic user stock the magic for the weak magic user. 
   This one looks good.. but it really makes a difficult situation for
   you as later in the game.

Tip from Scott: So it is REALLY ADVISIBLE for you to stock up 100x
                kind of those spells as the higher the amount of spell
                and stronger the spell, the better the junction. How
                junction magic? Refer to Section 2.2 or have the 
                Tutorial at the Fire Cavern...

1.4    GF Management

>>> Learning Abilities
This is VERY important for you know. From the GF screen, you will be 
able to select your GF and choose the ability to learn. If the GF 
has Boost, choose to learn that skill first. To get this you need to 
get AP (which I guess it stands for "Ability Points"). Boost is VERY
important, refer to Part II for more details. [It makes whole lot 
difference when you play the game.)

>>> Restore GF HP
Stupid me.. for knowing this only after getting the English Version.
GF has auto-walk recover! They restore HP by walking on the field. It 
works like taking them for walk! To better effects, choose to sleep in
the Dormitory or Hotels. Better still, use GF items like G-Potions.

>>> Improve Compatibility
I would recommend you junction Shiva with Quistis and have her summon
GF Shiva for every battle.. Summon GF frequently improves GF 
compatibility with that character. Compatibility is very important as 
it determines the speed of ATB of GF! You can get up 1000 
compatibility for the maximum.

1.5    World Map
You will encounter random monsters while walking on the World Map [
unless you have equipped Enc-Nothing from GF Diablos]. Different 
Monsters nab you different EXP, AP and items. So it is your interest to
meet them. AP allows GF to learn ability. EXP, which stands "Experience
Points" allows your character and GF to level up. Classification of 
Items will be discuss in detail in Part II

1.6    Magic Upgrades
Just like FF7 Materia.. as you level up the Materia level, you get an
intermediate version of spell. For the case of FF8, as your character
level up, you will be able to draw more powerful spells, like instead
of Fire you can get Fira! I have marked "*" for this types of spells.
Spells appears in brackets only appears for intermediate levels.

Level 1 ~ 20 - gets the primary spells. 
Level 21 ~30 - gets you the secondary spells and the secondary class
               spells marked by "[ ]"
Level 31 ^   - gets you the most powerful spells and the spells are
               marked by "{ }". You also see conversions of spells.
               (final class)

Abbreviation of conversion
{Scan > Dispel} This results a change from Scan to Dispel in the
                final levels. Easy to understand huh? If not contact me.

 \____________________________________________________________________/

Press SELECT to view the World Map. Press it again and you will be able
to view the full size of the World Map. The Fire Cavern is just behind 
the forests located near Balamb. Encounter rate in forests is higher
compared to grasslands.. It is quite safe to walk on the road.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the path leading to the Cavern, Quistis is prompt you a question 
whether she has taught you about Squall's Renzoukuken. Pick the 1st 
option to proceed. Next head to the entrance. BTW, you will also be 
given a Junction Tutorial on junction magic to your character..

You will find two Garden Faculties. Talk to them and they are asked you
whether you are ready or not. Pick 1st option to say yes and you will
see the SeeD salutation.. Now pick your time limit. It is pretty easy,
you are allow to choose between the intervals from 10 ~ 40 minutes. 
Choose between 20 minutes and 30 minutes. Quistis will be your support.
Make sure that you have a couple of Phoenix Downs and Potions.

The layout of pathway is rather straightforward.. but with a nagging
Quistis tagging along. Just simply walk until you saw the path being
split into three. The right path allows you to find another Draw 
Points, draw magic [Fire] from it. Now here is another important 
battle tip: The monsters here are mostly weak against Cold. Be careful
of Bombs as if you hit too much, It will use a move called Suicide 
which will perish with one of your characters! From the three way path,
head back and make a move to north. You will find a deep pit.. Suddenly
a volcano-like eruption begins.. A GF burst out! It is your first BOSS
Fight!

Strategy
Well, our first BOSS turns out to be an GF... BTW, GFs talks! First of 
all, don't bother to scan and I have already did it for you ^_^;. This 
BOSS is quite easy.. as remember this phrase "Same elemental monsters 
absorbs same elements." That means the Fire spells, which can be drawn
from the BOSS is quite useless.. First of all, summons GF Shiva [which 
easily inflict up 300+  HP damage maximum at Level 2 with Boost 
ability 

. The Ifrit will say "They have Shiva?" upon the first summon of GF 
  Shiva. Blizzard does quite a handy sum of damage to the BOSS [about 
  103+ HP damage.. if your character's magic strength is 16+]. The 
  Ifrit will also says "hmm.. not bad for humans" upon first casting 
  of Blizzard. The only strengths of this BOSS is the following
  techniques:
  "Impudent Humans!" --> The Ifrit will perform the "Jumper Claw Dive" 
  which is my name for it. The Ifrit will leap up high into the mid-air 
  and come slashing down with a claw swipe.. does about 100+ damage.
  "Fire" --> it does approximately 50+ HP damage. Fire-element.

This battle is not that tough.. as you can draw Cure [which is a 
healing magic] from the BOSS. If you want to play safe, I would suggest 
that you have either Quistis or Squall has the Item as their fourth 
command. After the battle, the Ifrit will says "Ugh.. I underestimate 
Shiva.. I'll join you" Therefore, now you have another GF! Note that 
BOSS Fights does not give your HP and their HP is variable based on 
Squall's Level. I have battle the Ifrit on Level 9. 

========================================================================

After the battle, Quistis will teach you something new.. it is about 
Elemental Arts [which is *very* useful later in the game.] Notice that 
the time limit has stopped... here is another difference. Junction 
Ifrit to one character and has Blizzard junction to the character's 
Elemental Attack. Exit the cavern and you will find the Garden Faculties 
are gone. Head back to Alcauld Plains and get some training for your new 
GF or if you want head back to Balamb Garden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Return back to Garden and at the gate, Quistis will leave your party.
Next she will tell Squall to meet her in the Lobby since that you have
completed the field test. She will tell you to change into your SeeD 
uniform. So head for the Dormitory. At the your dorm, head for the bed 
and positioned Squall next to the bed and press the X, choose the 2nd 
option. Exit the Dormitory. The screen will switches to the Lobby where
you will recruit a new partner, Zell Dincht. He will also give a 
Tutorial about his Limit Break, Duel.

Noticed Squall is rather cold-blooded [he doesn't care about anyone else
feelings and always kept to his own world] as he just simply give Zell a 
cold shoulder. Zell also rather dislike Seifer and comments to Squall 
about their mutual hate for Seifer. However, Quistis gives him a piece 
of surprising news, that is the leader for this mission is no other than 
Seifer Almasy! Seifer comes along with his pals, Fujin and Raijin. 
Seifer is rather unfriendly and rude person, for he has been classified 
as a "problem" child. Now the headmaster of Balamb Garden will 
eventually shows up, his name is Cid Kramer. Cid will briefly tell them 
about their mission. [heck.. basically about the glory of SeeD!] After 
the little chit-chat, Seifer and his company plus Zell leave the lobby. 
Squall will head for the Parking Lot and you will get into a vehicle. 
You are being grouped to Squad B..
 
Inside the vehicle, enjoy some funny conversation between the trio and
also Quistis Trepe. Zell will keep on asking that he wants to see 
Squall's gunblade. Squall does not respond, making Zell rather 
frustrated (well, this guy just can't sit still!) and gets up swaying a
couple of punches. Seifer tells him to sit down and shut up, also insult
him as "chicken-wuss" ^_^. Now the screen will switch to the World Map 
and you will be able to control the vehicle. Well, here are the controls 
of the vehicle

........................................................................
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS OF Vehicles IN FF8
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Square:     Moves your vehicle forwards.
Triangle:   Moves your vehicle backwards.
X:          Get in/ Get Out of vehicle.
Circle:     Main Menu
R2:         Changes the Point of View (POW)
Select:     World Map [Spot view, Side map, enlarged World Map]

I did not encounter any monsters while in a vehicle. At this moment of 
time, you can't get off from the vehicle. Just followed the road and 
make contact with the structure [there are only three structures in this 
continent, so it is pretty easy to find Balamb Town]

S o m e   f a c t s
They are the basic transport in FF8, allows you to head for forests
and around the world safety. Cars have a limited amount of fuel! Use a 
Fuel to replenish it. You will see a textbox appearing and a Fuel will 
be used automatically. [you will see that the car move slowly.. and this 
means you need to replenish it with a Fuel] Fuel can be brought at 
Towns.
........................................................................

Just simply drive your vehicle to the Balamb Town. You will eventually
ended up at the Dock. You have to enter the vessel, a submarine-like 
ship. Just as everyone have moved off, head up the stairs and enter the 
vessel (note that you can opened up the Junction menu...) Inside the 
vessel, you will given a talk by a SeeD member called Xu whom will brief 
you about your examinations. [Notice that Seifer has been to the test 
before.. well to know the reason, play the game!]

For the past 72 hours, Dollet City has been under-attacked by the 
Galbadian army. After 18 hours from outbreak of the war, the city of 
Dollet has been evacuated. At present, the people are hurrying to take 
refuge at the outlying of mountainous areas. The troop will disembark 
from Lapin Beach. Ask to eliminate any enemy soldiers. Asked to 
penetrate through the city and eliminate any enemy troops. 

After the briefing, Sue leaves. Squall decide to do something, that's 
is talk to whom? You will be given 4 options:
 
-> Talk to Quistis
-> Talk to Seifer
-> Talk to Zell
-> Do Nothing

Seifer will now asked Squall to take a look outside the vessel. Choose
the following option "....OK" (bare with it.. as he is your leader.)
Once arrived on the beach, just follow Seifer. You will be able to 
control Squall and Zell will follow you. Note that you are to get
junction each GF to each character. Junction Ifrit to Squall. And give
every character a one GF each. Have them the following commands: Magic, 
GF, Draw. Trade Quistis' magic to either one of them or might as split 
up and stock up magic from the G-Soldiers. Now walk up the stairs (don't
talk.. just walk up), use the Save Point if you feel the need to do so.
 
You will fight 2 G-Soldiers, each of them being armed with a sword. 
They are quite simple not that tough, just simply throw in what you got.
This will nab you 2 AP and 2x Potions. Draw magic from them and stock 
it up for later use. There is rather a high probability, you will 
encounter random battles, so be always on your guard. Continue following 
Seifer into the city. In the screen where you see a bar, you will find a
bridge and were ambushed another 2 G-Soldiers. [get you another Potion
and 2 AP] Continue in following Seifer and he will talk more at the 
screen where you find a shop named "Noutlius" and there is a car there.. 
Good work, Zell ^_^;

At the Town Square where you find a fountain, there you will be 
attacked by another G-Soldier (nab 1x Potion and 1 AP). Now your leader
will give you some orders, which are to scout for enemies. At the upper 
right-hand corner, you will meet another G-Soldier [it's somewhere near 
the car]. (nab you only 1 AP).

Next talk to Seifer, wait until Seifer start to comment on the mission
started to get bored. Just wait there for a while, where you will find 
the dog irritating Seifer. To prevent the dog from being hurt, talk to
the dog! Now the party will hide at one corner, approach Seifer...
Getting rather frustrated, Seifer chases the dog away and causes the 
dog to bark. Six Galbadian soldiers started to march towards left. 
Seifer will tell both Zell and Squall to chase them. Zell did not wished 
to do that [as they will not following the orders..] But surprisingly, 
Squall agrees with Seifer... (for 1 reason, Seifer is their leader) So 
chase after them, and keep on following Seifer. Next you will be 
crossing a bridge and keep on heading left. You will encounter random 
battles there rather frequently. Whew! you have finally caught up with 
Seifer. Talk to the wounded Dollet soldiers. As you talk to the person, 
who is crawling on the stairs, and the soldier will get ripped up! 
Beware, as you are going to battle a Anacandour, a huge snake-type 
creature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This BOSS isn't really tough. You can draw healing magic from this guy.
Just use your GF to toast the BOSS. Beware of the Dark Mist as it does 
a massive amount of damage + poison-status effect. Do not use Bio (if 
you have the spell) on the BOSS. Use GF Shiva with the "Boost" ability 
for more damage. Refer to Part II about Boost for more details. Junction 
100x magic to boost the characters. The BOSS can cause a lot of mischief
with its Dark Mist, use a Remedy or Antidote to fix that status ailments.

Seifer's No Mercy!
Yep.. Seifer is indeed different. He can unleash his Limit Break: No
Mercy even if his HP is only 40% of his total HP. He has a gunblade 
trigger just like Squall.. just keep on tap R1 while he was generating
the energy field. This is perhaps the last battle that you are using as
Seifer Almasy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue up the stairs and head for the Communications Tower. Proceed up
the screen.. and you will find a huge tower with 3 Galbadians Soldiers
talking about a huge monster living there... Your teammates will try to 
stay under cover at the cliff found in front of the Tower. Seifer wants 
to head on and goes off on his own (does not make decision wisely huh?), 
Next you will be introduced to a new party member... in a funny CGI 
movie.

The girl's name is Selphie. She is formerly a member of Squad A. Well 
she will also thank you for taking her around Balamb Garden if you have
did so... if not, say bye for that thanks ^_^; She will jump off the 
cliff and asked you to follow her. Examine the cliff with X and you can
get two options. You can also move right which leads to a winding path
to the tower.. Make your choice. Now she will join your party once you
talk to her. NOTE that she will have all spells that you stocked. 
Junction Quezacotl to her and try to build up the compatibility. Enter 
the Tower and you will find Seifer chasing out the G-Soldiers from the
Tower ^_^; Enter the tower to follow Seifer. I would recommend you have
someone with item as their fourth command for you don't Life Magic.

Next the scene was transferred to the conversation between Wedge and 
Major Biggs. Now head inside the tower, equip Guardian Forces for each 
of them. Draw from the Draw Point found on the left of the elevator 
[Blind]. There is also a Save Point located on the right of the 
elevator. Proceed towards the elevator and use the elevator by choosing 
the top option with the X button. At the top of tower, you will have 
another CGI feast... Biggs is surprised that you were there and he 
called for Wedge but no response. ^_^; try to escaped but his plan is
backfired by Seifer.... It is your 2nd BOSS Fight!

Strategy

>>> Fighting against Biggs and Wedge
You firstly face Biggs and just simply attack him with attacks and 
magic. As he was seriously wounded in the process, he will call for 
Wedge (well, a pretty amusing sequence). Just keep on focus your attacks 
on one of them. After defeating one of them and you will eventually meet 
up with the main BOSS of this section. Biggs have the probability of 
casting Cure on Wedge if both of them is seriously injured. Kill Biggs
first! Draw Cure to maintain your character's HP at its maximum. Draw
Esuna from Wedge and stock it up.

>>> Fighting against the Elvoret
It took me a while to figure this way to defeat this cookie in a few 
minutes' time.. Notice that its Defensive stats as being scan is *very*
low, this means that "Limit Breaks are the killer weapon!" Just draw 
GF Siren (there is a way to get it after this battle...) and stock up
Double if you want to make your life easy.. Have Selphie and Squall
as healers that is to draw Cure* from the BOSS to restore HP. Selphie 
is a great character for her Limit Breaks are very strong where comes
to offence or defense. Target to get Full-cure first just to continue
your stocking up of Double [20+ Mag stats should have no problem...].
Use Squall's Renzokuken at the maximum of 2 times only [junction any
100x Fire or other element to his Str through Str-J] as the BOSS will
use its Mist Breath which does ~100 HP to all characters. Upon the
first time, have Zell/Selphie using Draw Cure and Cast. In this way
it is no sweat! Once your HP is back to its maximum, continue your stock
up Double run...
========================================================================

As you are done with the BOSS, you will have a short conversation. 
Seifer will leave... Why? Actually Selphie is a messenger from Squad A
and to inform Squad B to evacuate with 30 minutes time to head back to 
Lapin Beach where the vessel is docked. So hurry! Examine the elevator 
and pick the first option. (don't forget to Junction Siren to Squall,
this GF is really good)

As Squall and his members were heading to the ground floor, you will 
have a scene of Biggs activating the controls, thus summoning the 
"Black Widow" to attack your party. Back at the ground floor of the 
tower, save your game and use Potions/Cure to restore lost HP. Head 
for the entrance and you will encounter the "Black Widow" It will be 
more advisible to use a Tent at the Save Point. Note that the time 
limit still continues during the battles with the BOSS. Do worry, there 
is no random battles during this sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy #1
Well, it is pretty easy (but not easy to knock it down with such low
levels and advance spells). I have classified them into two strategies:
The BOSS' main weakest is Thunder. So cast Thunder and summon GF 
Quezacotl is your key weapon in your arsenal... To finish it off 
quickly, summon Quezacotl along with "Boost" ability. Once the BOSS is
down, you will heard from Zell saying press L2 and R2 to escape.. 
that's to run.. proceed the "Mad Run Chase" Junction Thunder to your
character's Elem-Atk-J [Ifrit have that ability] Continue with the "Mad
Run Chase"

Strategy #2: Defeat "Black Widow" Strategy
Beforehand preparations
Defeating this guy is not impossible but you really need to level up to
Level 18+. You must gotten make Mid Class Mag-RF from the Quezacotl,
SumMag +20%, Elemental Attack for 2 characters and Ability with BOSS.
Convert 5x Thunder to Thundara using the menu. Get 100x of Thundara to
junction to Squall's Elem-Atk-J and junction 100x of another mid-class
magic to his Str-J. Junction 100x Double to Selphie's Mag Stats and her
affection with Quezacotl at about 900+. Have Squall under critical 
status (let Squall die in the battle against the Elvoret and use a 
Phoenix Down). At the battle, keep on using Renzokuken and have the 
rest using Cure to restore Squall's health at least about 240+. 
Continue with the "Mad Run Chase"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Mad Run Chase"
Well, I have only did once to fight against the BOSS only once.. but I 
still can't skip one of them...You will encounter the BOSS at least 2 
times if you follow my instructions..
- First fall.. can't escape. This is a compulsory battle.
- For the path on the right, just keep on walking down.
- The cliff .. hold Left when you reach that screen.
- The steps.. The floor vibrates as you walk down.. try to walk by 
  holding down triangle. Thanks a lot pals. (See Credits section)
- the path where the wounded soldier is being squeeze to death.., just
  walk down..
- The bridge.. It works like this.. Tune up volume of your TV a bit 
  louder so that you can heard the footsteps of X-ATM092... Just 
  simply move right until you heard a loud thud [the X-ATM092 jump
  across your party]. Move left and once it jump... make a RIGHT TURN!
  It take time to practices this..
- The Town Square.. save the dog, but examining it with X button
- The area with the car.. just walk south and enjoy a CGI of the car
  being squashed!
- Outside the Pub.. Just walk south..
- The main street.. this is really scary.. HOLD the D-Pad's DOWN!

*End of Chase* (Phew!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Watch a CGI on how Quistis stop this monster....

Now your party are back safe and sound. Back at the harbour, Seifer 
returns back to his normal self. His pals will come to the harbour and 
praises him for the victory. Quistis will congratulate Squall and the 
rest for doing a great job. However, the unfriendly Seifer and his 
company just simply uses your only transport, thus leaving your party 
back at the harbour. Now you have to walk back to Balamb Garden.....

Exit the area and you will be at a winding path and there is a Hotel.
Pay 100 gil to stay in the Hotel [as resting at the inn, will help to 
recover all your lost HP, but it also does provide help to your GFs]. 
If you want to save your game, use the Save Point found at the corner 
of the room. [There is also a copy of the Timber Maniacs.] Rest as 
you must be tired and has lost quite a lot of HP [pick the first option 
and pay 100 gil]. Head left and you will enter the main compound of 
Balamb Town. There is a Draw Point here, draw some magic. [Thunder] 
If you talk to the man sitting on the bench, you will find out that he 
seems rather familiar to Zell. Actually, this is Zell's hometown! There 
are three houses found within the main compound. Here is a map of 
Balamb.

If you want to level up your party, well it is a good time to do so. 
If you rent a car, parked it outside Balamb Garden as only cars from
Garden is allow to enter Balamb Garden.. so park it in the wild. Tied up
with your limited cash? Just walk on the road.. it is pretty safe ^_^;

If you have enough cards and you may want to try your luck out against
Ma Dincht to get Zell's Card by defeating her in a card game.

Proceed towards the Lobby. You will meet Quistis, Cid and Xu near the 
Directory of Balamb Garden. Talk to them and you will be given the 
following options:
- Felt good
- Sacred to death
- ... Whatever

Here is a piece of good news. The SeeD mission is being held 
successfully! Talk to Cid and he will speak for a short while. Now head 
right from here and you will meet Seifer at the entrance of the path 
that is leading towards the library. Talk to him... Noticed Seifer's 
expressions... He seems rather fed up. You want to know why? 

Here comes the answer.. Cid will enter this area and talk to Seifer, 
the reason why he has failed the SeeD test mainly because he likes to do 
things on his own. Seifer's hatred is being stirred and stays at within 
that area. Now head for the elevator and you will hear the announcement 
as all Garden cadets are asked to head outside the classroom located on 
the 2nd floor. Now talk to everyone whom is within the area outside the 
classroom. Noticed that Zell is walking back and forth? He is rather 
nervous about his results. After a while, a Garden Faculty will come up 
and announce the results to the group of anxious cadets.

Announcing those whom have passed the SeeD test.... Zell of Squad B! 
and Squall of Squad B! Surprisingly, only Squall and Zell have passed 
the test among all, watch the expressions of those whom have failed the 
tests. Now the screen switches to the Cid's office where you have the 
inguration Ceremony. Only four Garden Cadets have passed the SeeD test 
Before you have left the area, talk to Cid. He will give you an item 
called the Battle Meter [it is something associated with your SeeD 
ranking, your battles (like how many times you have been KO, how many 
enemies that you have killed) which is accessible through the Balamb 
Garden Network or your Tutorial menu.] Next you will be shown the 
results of your performance at the Dollet Mission. [How to get full 
marks, read on..]

From now onwards you do the test at any moment of the game. Squall is 
now an official SeeD member. You will receive money, based on the number
of steps on that you walk on the field. The higher the SeeD ranking it 
is, the more money that you will earn. To gain higher ranks for SeeD 
levels, do the SeeD tests. You will be promoted by 1 level each time 
after gaining full marks for each test. Before you had received money, 
you will hear a ring and find those stats at the lower part of the 
screen. If you walk for too long without doing anything related to the 
story, your SeeD level will decrease! So avoid that as much as you can. 
If you have SeeD level A, you will received 30,000 gil each time!

Here are the answers to the SeeD test:

These answers will help to promote Squall's SeeD Level by 1. Once Squall 
is an officially SeeD member, you will be able to receive money through 
walking around the field. The highest SeeD Level that the test can give 
Squall is Level 30. To get SeeD Level 31 or A, you can get this by 
defeating more monsters or proceed in completing the game. The TEST 
option is only accessible after Squall has finished the Dollet Mission.

NOTES ABOUT SeeD Tests...

<> You can only do tests if you have acquired the certain levels [this
   depends on Squall's level.] For example, to do Test No. 19, Squall 
   must acquired Level 19 and above.
<> The higher the SeeD ranking, the more money Squall will receive.
   SeeD Level 30 allows you to earn 20,000 gil each time. While SeeD
   Level A allows you to earn 30,000 gil each time. You will hear a
   ring each time, Squall receives his salary.
<> The levels of the SeeD ranking are unstable. The level will 
   automatically dropped if Squall wanders too much on the field. So
   it is better to do some than wandering around! To get back the 
   level, get into battles and you will get back that level sooner or
   later.
<> Complete mission in perfect situation allows your SeeD ranking to
   be promoted by one and sometimes also decrease by one ^_^;. I will
   mentioned while in the walkthrough.

Do you know?
The Dollet Mission is also a SeeD test. The test results depends 
solemnly on your actions in the game from field test at the Fire Cavern
to the Dollet Dukedom Parliament Mission. The status are classified in 
the 5 categories: To get full marks here are requirements.
I would like to thank Mark Kim for his intensive guide on this area
Thanks a lot! I have make some corrections regarding the word width and
certain changes.

Ifrit's Fire Cave:

Select Ten Minutes as opposed to Forty Minutes on the Japanese version.  
If you want to draw a whole lot of Magic, then do your powering-up 
outside and after Ifrit joins in.  Be sure to check Ifrit's HP's with 
scan (I know that you've scanned it for us on your FAQ) because if you 
deplete all of Ifrit's HP's and if there's a lot of time left, then this 
will only hurt your evaluation.  For example, if you have caused 1,000 
points of damage to Ifrit thus far, then you should wait until the timer 
reaches 35 seconds or about and then finish Ifrit off with physical 
attacks.  You may need to set the Battle Message to VERY FAST in order 
to avoid accidental expiration of the time limit.  This is EXTREMELY 
RISKY but it's quite worth the effort because this helps your rating a 
bit.

 From the start of the Dollet Field Exam:

* AVOID TALKING TO ANYBODY with the exception of Seifer Almasy and Zell 
Dincht. Follow orders from Seifer at all times. If you blow Seifer off 
at the sub, then it won't look good on your evaluation. You will receive 
less points and a lower rank if you initiate any conversations in 
between the following: Anybody in Dollet, anybody in Balamb, Quistis 
Trepe, Xu, Headmaster Cid, Raijin, Fujin, anybody other than Zell or 
Seifer. Some conversations may wield heavier penalties than the others.

* Use physical or magical attacks instead.  Don't let any Guardian Forces 
do any deathblows on the enemies because every enemy counts towards your 
evaluation.

* Don't take Selphie's shortcut (The Cliff Jump).  You'll be praised for 
dignity if you just take the long way out.

* One time when I tried to go to the Communications Tower before Seifer 
said so, Zell scolded at me for "not sticking up to orders".  If Zell 
has to scold you (much to the fact that Seifer hasn't ordered me to do 
so yet), you will receive moderate penalties on your evaluation.

* Save the dog during the escape from X-ATMO92.

* Don't hide inside the cafe just because you want to escape from the 
  X-ATMO92. I personally would just run back the way I entered the 
  Dollet Field Exam since I want to look at a kick-ass cut scene. If you 
  do hide inside the cafe, then it won't look good on your evaluation.

* Don't run from battles.  You shouldn't be able to because most are a 
  piece of cake.  Doing this will only hurt your evaluation. The only 
   exception to this is when you are trying to run away from X-ATMO92.

* It's possible to minimize the number of times to run away from 
  X-ATMO92. If you can only initiate one battle from X-ATMO92, then it 
  will look a lot better on your record.

* The more time you have on the clock during the withdrawal from 
  X-ATMO92, the better your evaluation will be.

So, to help you out a bit, here's how each of the five categories would 
like:

Judgment: How much time was left right after Ifrit finished his defeat 
speech and as soon as the Experience Claim Screen rings up.  For example, 
if I had a time of 6 seconds left by the time the screen switches, then 
my evaluation would look so far. This has NOTHING to do with character 
levels. Only the time remaining will be tabulated on your final 
evaluation.

Conduct: The more time you have on the clock when you complete the 
withdrawal order, the better your evaluation will be.

Attack: The more enemies you kill, the better your evaluation would 
be. I'm thinking that it will be the combined amount of enemies your 
ENTIRE PARTY has killed in their own hands. This does not include 
enemies killed by Guardian Forces.

Spirit: Never ever run away from battles, except for the first
fight against the X-ATM092.

Attitude:  

The number of people you talked to from the start of the Dollet Field 
Exam until the grade report is given. There are mandatory penalties for 
talking to ANYBODY other than Seifer Almasy or Zell Dincht. Don't talk 
to Selphie Tilmitt until Seifer leaves your party. For example, if I 
have talked to Quistis Trepe near the Directory, then I would only 
suffer lower ranks. This includes talking to anybody at Balamb, 
shopping at Balamb, using the Hotel at Balamb, just about anything used 
to initiate conversations at Balamb will detract your rating. Note that 
talking to some people will wield heavier penalties than others.

* Every time Zell has to scold you for attempting to approach the 
Communications Tower before Seifer said so, you will receive moderate 
penalties. One time Zell scolded me for doing this, so I would suffer 
point loss for this.

* Take Selphie's shortcut and you will receive moderate penalties for 
indignity.

* Save the dog. It should be easy. If the dog dies through the hands of 
the X-ATMO92 during the withdrawal chase, you will receive heavy 
penalties.

* If you blow Seifer off when he gives you an order at the Sub, then you 
might be penalized.

* If you go inside the Cafe to hide from the X-ATMO92, then you will 
receive EXTREME Penalties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After getting the item, exit from that area. Now you should be back at
the walkway in front of classroom. Proceed to the classroom... You will
meet Seifer, along with his pals Fujin and Raijin. To your surprise...
they have clapped for those whom have passed the SeeD test!

Next Squall will be back at the Dormitory. Selphie is there, dressed in 
her brand new SeeD Graduation suit. Proceed to the room near the Save 
Point and examine the bed. Pick the second option and Squall will 
change his clothes into his SeeD graduation suit. You can save your 
game by using the Save Point. Just simply walk away from the Dormitory 
or talk to Selphie. Squall will be leaning against the wall of the 
ballroom. What a loner... Zell will come by and try to talk to Squall..
(well Squall is still so unfriendly if you chooses "..."). Next Selphie
will come and asked Squall whether he is interested in joining the 
Garden Festival Committee. This switches to the meeting of Squall's 
love and of course a fantastic FMV of Squall dancing with his loved one.

Now the scene switches to the balcony, where Squall will have a short 
conversation with Quistis. Quistis will tell you to change back to your 
clothes and meet her at the hall of the Training Center. Exit from the 
balcony and Squall will be on his thoughts "Why Quistis wants me to do 
at this moment of time?" Examine the bed and pick the first option, 
equip GFs on both Squall and Quistis only. Exit from the Dormitory. 
Noticed that the walkways leading to the other areas of Balamb Garden 
are being sealed off, except for walkways leading to the Dormitory and 
the Training Center. Proceed to the training center and you will 
eventually meet up with Quistis at the walkway. She will tell you 
whether you have met up with T-Rexaur.. and tells you the way to defeat
it! This leads to the Status Junction Tutorial..

Well, I have brought up the map once again:

Defeat the T-Rexaur: Meet your Doom
________________________________________________________________________
This monster is *very* tough. At a low level of 8, it has already
10,000+ HP! How to defeat it? Here is before hand preparations you need
to do before the battle. 
- Get 100x Sleep and junctioned it to ST-Atk-J [GF Siren have that 
  ability]
- Get Shiva's Doom Command.
- Junction 100x Blizzard* to your character's Elem-Atk-J
- Junction 100x Double to the character's Str-J

Get into the battle, have Squall attack the T-Rexaur and it should does
double the damage that you normally does to a normal monster. The 
T-Rexaur is very weak against Sleep. Once it is on sleep, summon GF
Shiva for Quistis or cast Doom on the GF.. Well stock up magic or just
use to GF and wait for the T-Rexaur's Death..
________________________________________________________________________

From that area, you will find red pipes and raw substances used as 
building materials. Just proceed forward. Now you will find a Save 
Point found with the rocks. Walk up and go through the brighten gateway. 
[Do you know that, this is actually a secret place for student lovers 
of Balamb Garden, why Quistis have brought Squall here..]. This place
is marked "X" on the map as the "forbidden" area

There will be a short and slow sequence between the two. From that spot, 
they will be able to view the building of Balamb Garden. It seems that 
Quistis is talking about her past on how she has joined SeeD. Of course,
Squall is still cold-blooded as before..

After the conversation has ended, head right and absorb some magic from 
the Draw Point located near the edge of the land [Blizzard]. Head right 
and cross the bridge. Walk towards south and....

Ahhh!

You see a girl being surrounded by a huge insect! [remember the girl 
who has peeped into Infirmary at the beginning?]. Squall draws his 
sword and started to attack on the monster... It's another BOSS fight!

Description:  Granaldo: A large insect type monster that is a survior
              of some ancient race uses its large spikes and tail to
              attack.
              Raldo: May look slow due to its stone-like body but it
              is actually quite fast, may appear in numbers.
Facts:        Granaldo: Weak against Wind
Attacks:      Granaldo: (Claw Swipe), (Tail whip)
              Raldo: (Claw Swipe)
              Combined: (Rolling Raldo),(Raldo Bomb)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This BOSS isn't that tough as those Raldos will not attacked your 
characters when the main BOSS is around. The BOSS is pretty weak in 
physical attacks. Just use the magic that you have already drawn from 
the monsters. Note that the BOSS can make of the Raldo and use as it's 
weapon. Make full use of the Guardian Monsters and Magic to deal the 
BOSS a deadly blow. Cast Cure or use Potions to restore lost HP. 
You will get 14 AP when you defeat all three. The battle will only end 
when all of them were killed. To reduce damage, draw Protect [reduce
physical damage] and Shell [reduces damage done by magic]. Shell 
works well against Magic attacks, but also reduce the rate of healing,
so take note.

You can draw Sleep from the BOSS and use it on the BOSS. While BOSS 
is under the Sleep status, summon your GFs and you will be able get rid 
of the Raldos at one time! If the main BOSS is under the Sleep status, 
take this opportunity to stock up Protect and Shell, they works well!
========================================================================

After the battle, the girl whom was being harmed by Granaldo is being
saved... but suddenly 2 white SeeDs appeared from nowhere (?). Since the 
girl is saved, now exit from the Training Center... Quistis will now
say that the mission has ended and you're free to go back to your room.
(kind of strange... got a weird feeling)

Now head back to Dormitory and you will find Zell (still dressed in his
SeeD uniform) there. He will tell you that their dorms has been changed
to a single-dormitory.. Looks good huh? Time to take a nap.. ZZZZZ..

The next morning, you will be asked to head for the Central Gate and it
is an EMERGENCY. So hurray.. Make sure you nab the Weapon Mon Apr from 
the desk on the right. Now head for the Central Gate... 

At the central gate, you will have another short sequence... Zell is 
still not there but he comes with a super cool surfboard! [known as "T-
Boards"] However, T-Boards are not allowed in the compound.. and watch 
some funny sequence.. T-Board being confiscated ^_^; Now you will be
asked to head for Timber where you are going to tell a group known as 
"The Forest Owls". And Cid will give the password, here is it: 

The person: "The forests of Timber have changed"
Your reply: "But owls are still around"

Now exit, but before you leave you could talk to Cid and he will give 
you an item called the "Magical Lamp" and he said that it is cursed..
Well, make sure that your party is in full health before you uses the
item from the item menu as this lead to a BOSS fight!

Strategy

"Who dares to disturb my sleep?"

This fight is very tough for low levels. But there is a way to defeat 
it. Here is the method.

Junction 100x Sleep to your ST-Atk-J
         100x Double to your Mag-J
         100x Fire/Blizzard/Thunder to your Str-J
         Have Selphie in your party, with Full-cure learnt
         Adequate supply of Phoenix Downs.

Start the battle by stocking Demi. Have all characters with the following
commands: Attack, Magic, Draw, Item as their basic commands. (I don't
summon GFs to fight this GF.. Perhaps one character with GF, Magic and
Draw) Draw as much Demi as possible for it is good for boost up your 
character's stats. Be careful of the following attacks: 

Gravija:  extreme dangerous as you reduces 3/4 of your character's HP
          and it affects all characters.
Demi:     does the same as Gravija but to only one character.
(charge): This is killer weapon after the BOSS has cast Gravija.

The BOSS looks tough with the above and plus its high HP at low levels.
To defeat it. Draw Demi and choose Stock instead of Cast. Next turn,
cast your stocked Demi on the BOSS. [It is rather difficult as it fails
most of the time, that's Double is useful for.] and the Diablos will
counter it with Curaga on the character that uses the Demi on the BOSS!
For this battle, it is really easy to use your character's Limit Breaks.
Use them only once and next restore your HP. If you managed to defeat 
it, here is a humorous comment:

"Too much sleep... too weak." ^_^;)
========================================================================

Exit from Garden and you are back on the World Map. You had rent a 
vehicle, you will find your vehicle at the spot, where you have parked. 
You can enter the Dock using the car too. If you don't have, walk 
towards the Balamb Town. As you arrived at the town, head south from 
the Gas Station. Now walk down and make a left turn, there you will 
meet Zell's close friend. Next, walk left and you will reach the train 
station. There is a shop situated at the right side of the station, 
which sells items. [Refer to Section 3.3 for more details, I have 
included a shopping list.] Purchase some Phoenix Downs, it will help 
you in the later part of the game..

After this, talk to the man at the station and pay him 3,000 gil to 
enter the train. What happened if you have insufficient gil..., just 
head back to the World Map and level up for about 15 minutes and you 
will receive some cash ^_^;

Inside The Train.....
There is a Save Point inside the train. Next Zell will talk to both 
Squall and Selphie. They will leave the room. Follow their suit. Talk 
to Zell and he will enter the room on the left. Selphie will remain at 
the walkway of the train, happily singing. Now head inside the room and 
talk to Zell whom is sitting on the crouch. Zell will handled the Pet
Pals Vol. 1 to you that he has found on the train. Move towards Zell 
and pick any option. Well it is about Timber Town.

Then Selphie will enter the room, looking unwell. Suddenly, Selphie 
passes out, so is Zell. Squall tries to approach them, but suddenly fall 
unconscious, lying on the ground and the screen fades.... No! this 
isn't the headaches which, Cloud of FF7 has regularly has!

Now the mission had switches it's focus to Laguna and his company for 
the first time. The guy with long hair is Laguna Loire. The massive one 
is Ward Zaback. He is armed with a powerful Harpoon. Kiros Seagul is
the other guy. He carries two long swords (katal). Pretty cool huh?

NOTE:  At this moment of time, they will be able to access your GFs
       Cards, Items and Magic. Laguna will have all Squall's commands 
       that you have equipped. Ward will have all Zell's commands that 
       you have equipped. Kiros will have all the commands that you 
       have equipped on Selphie. They will also be able to fight the 
       Diablos that has been trapped inside the Magical Lamp, given by 
       Cid. In this section, you will encounter random battles in the 
       grasslands, similar to those at Great Plains of Galbadia. There 
       is one common factor for all Laguna's Dream Sequences, that the 
       maximum amount of gil they have is 3,000 gil.

The path is rather straightforward. Just simply walk along the track 
and head northeast. The path is surrounded by high grasslands. There
is a Draw Point found along the path. [Cure] Now head up and you will 
see a lot of speech bubbles at a time. [it was actually Squall's 
thoughts]. Make an anti-clockwise turn and you will find a Draw Point. 
Draw Water from the Draw Point and enter the truck. Next the truck will 
transport you to Deling. At the city, once you have exit from the truck, 
head south. You will be in an area where you see a path in "/" 
direction. You will find a hotel called Galbadia Hotel. At the main 
hall you will find a Save Point. Next you can choose to sleep in the 
hotel, it cost 100 gil. After the "goodnight sleep", walk down the 
stairs found on the right of the main hall. Next talk to the waitress 
who is wearing a blue velvet, and she is found in front of the piano. 
Next a lady dressed in red [Julia] will come out and play the piano. 
You will see Laguna talking to his pals. Once you regain control of 
Laguna, head and talk to Julia... Well, Laguna got a cramp! Now retreat!
Next Julia will approach Laguna and have a short chit-chat. Julia will 
move upstairs and thus leaving Laguna in his thoughts. (well, you see
Laguna is being invited to her room..) Now head back to the man at the 
counter and pick the first option. There you will see a brief talk 
between Laguna and the Julia. Again, the screen will then fade again...

Now it is time to change back to present.. Squall and his party wake up
from that strange dream....
You will eventually get off the train at the Timber Town [I think it 
says "Timber Station", the wording is a bit too tough to read!] There 
is a booth, which will tell you something [It is a souvenir shop!]. 
- Owl's Tears - this one is under research.
- The Map of Timber - well, the lady has drawn up a map of Timber.
- Naughty Magazine - Zone is waiting for "Girl Next Door"
- Train Models

In front of the pet shop, there is a guy blocking the entrance. So that
you can enter the shop for the time being.. You will meet up with the
guy (Watts) and he will says the "The forests of Timber have changed"
and you need to answer with the password [hint: look for the word "
Owls"]

AT THE TRAIN.. [Forests Owl's Headquarters]
Your party will stay there for a while. You will meet the leader whom 
is dressed in blue [Zone] while the other is wearing a yellow cap is 
also the member of the Forest Owls [Watts]. Zone has always some
trouble with his stomach and always puke at a corner ^_^;. Go up 
the stairs on the extreme right. There is a Save Point at the left-
hand side of the train. I suggest that you use it. Play a card game
with Watts and try to win the Angelo's card, how to play refer to the 
card game Tutorial found in the Tutorial menu. Next you need to wake up
the princess of Forest Owls.. Up the stairs and you will find the 
controls room on the right and you can also find a Save Point there.

Now exit from the area and continue to head up, until you reached a 
high-class cabin. Inside the room, is the person whom has danced 
with Squall at the Graduation Party. The moment she notices Squall, She 
hugs Squall and will have a brief chat. She will tell her name, [Rinoa]. 
Her dog will enter the cabin later and you can name her dog [Angelo]. 
She will also brief you about a Tutorial about her Limit Break. Notice
that she keeps on talking on Seifer (actually it was Seifer whom has 
introduce her to Cid so that she can have SeeD backup the Forest Owls
to gain the Timber's independence. 

Once she had left the room, head back to the main cabin where your 
party was. Everyone will have a short chit-chat. Next you will be led 
to a room (where they will discuss you about the plan to assassinate the
President Vinzar Deling), which has a model of the tunnel.

Once you're ready, talk to the Zone and pick the first option. (that's
means you are sure with the sequence.) Before heading there, you can 
view some magazines, actually it is Anarchist Monthly which summarise
about the founding of Galbadia and how Vinzar Deling becomes to the 
President... Exit from this area. Head to the room where you met Rinoa
earlier.. and get the Pet Pals Vol. 2 from the crouch. If you are 
observant, you can find a dummy of Vinzar Deling in the controls room,
it speaks! Talk to Watts and choose the 2nd option and the screen will 
fade... [that's OK]

You will now be at the top of the train and your characters will jump 
across to reach the other train [pressing X]. Next Rinoa will talk 
to Squall and the scene will switches to the President whom you are 
chasing after. There you will have to the "Connecting Guide" section 
and followed by an CGI, showing the unlocking of train carriages. Now 
you will be on the other green train carriage and doing the "Connecting
Guide" and followed by another CGI of the unlocking of trains and the 
replacement of the train carriage.

AIM:   Enter the codes to unhook the train without being discovered by
       Galbadian soldiers. Your aim is to replace the President's
       carriage with the empty one.

Firstly Squall will set up the device vertically on the top of the 
train. Rinoa will tell you the code. The code panel is shown on the top 
right-hand corner. You have to enter the number shown on the panel. 
For example: Let's says if the code to input is 4333, presses Triangle, 
Square, Square, Square. You will be forced to stop if you were caught
by the patrolling Galbadian soldiers. For the first train carriage, you
have to input 3 codes within the given time limit. The codes need not 
to be input continuously. Note that you can can't move while input the 
codes on the panel. If a soldier is coming forward, press up and Squall 
will be back at the top of the train. For the first mission, press L1 
to look left to see the Galbadian soldiers are approaching you. For 
second time, you will have to input 5 codes with the same time limit. 
Press R2 to view right if Galbadian soldiers are moving towards you.
If you have failed, you will given an extended time [note that this
will decrease your SeeD ranking] If you managed to do this within the
given time limit for the first time, your SeeD ranking will be promoted
by one.
........................................................................

Now you will back at the place where you firstly enter this train. Zone 
will have another stomachache. Once gain control of Squall, head back 
to the place where you find the Save Point and save your game. Return 
and talk to the man wearing a cap [Watts] and pick the 2nd Option and 
the screen will fade once again...

Now you were in the carriage where the President was. Rinoa approaches 
the President but the structure of the President is rather uneasy.. As 
you have guessed, it is another BOSS fight!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy

This battle is EXTREMELY easy... For you can just defeat the BOSS with
a Phoenix Down.. The Fake President is not that tough... instead it can
be defeated rather easy (not sweat), just try to maintained your 
characters' HP at full health. After the battle, the fake president will
drop down and eventually transformed into the Gerogero! Lights blast
from the ground. Well, I could easy that it will be pretty easy to 
defeat it to use Potions/Cure/Phoenix Downs.. To fight head on, summon
GF Ifrit. Also make use of this opportunity to stock up Double. The BOSS
has also a couple of dangerous tactics.

"Brrawggg!" The BOSS yelled and split a energy breath against one 
            character causes a fixture of status ailments, thus uses
            "Dark Mist Breath"
"Arm Bang"  Using its deformed arms, the Gerogero whip hard at the 
            character with its deformed arms.

========================================================================

As you have defeat the BOSS, you will back at the place where you will
shown the train diagram. Zone will squat down and puke. Now talk to 
Rinoa whom is squatting along with the other two. (well.. it is their
unique way of having a meeting ^_^;) Squall will follow Rinoa's suit 
and receive 2 pieces of paper. It is a message from Cid Kramer.. well,
it meet that the assigned SeeD mercenaries (Squall, Selphie and Zell)
are to serve the Forest Owls until the Independence of Timber ^_^;

Zone will have another stomachache [is there something wrong with his 
stomach?] and you were told to head for the Timber TV station as the
President is going to make a live telecast through the Communications
Tower (so that's the reason why Galbadians are there...)

Rinoa will join you and you will have to form a new party of three. 
Next exit from the area, through south. Head up the stairs and use that 
Save Point. Now talk to Watts and choose "...OK". The train will now 
return back to the Timber Station.

Timber Maniacs..
Head to "Timber Maniacs" marked "C" on the map. You can find a 
receptionist and copies of magazines on the group. Search the deck near
the receptionist counter and you will find the "Girl Next Door" (do not
sell it as it worth a lot later in the game). You will find the printing
room on the left. You can draw Blizzarga from the draw point there (it
is hidden). Walk up and you will reach the reporters room. There is a
Timber Maniacs found at the right side of the room (it is a gold 
coloured item). If you talk to the guy on the north and you will be 
given these options. Pick any one you preferred.

- About Timber Maniacs
- Talk about the dream with Laguna -> a short sequence.
- About Timber's Situation
- Nothing in particular -> to stop all the crap..

House on the right..
Here you can have some fun... First of all talk to the ladies found on
the first floor. You will see them doing the cooking there.. They will
say that you can view the walkway behind the pub from the window there.
Head to the second floor. You will find a boy standing upside down,
leaning against the wall.. Examine the window and you will be given the
following option..

. Look out the window..
. Forget it..

Next don't be surprised.. As you will be asked to hand 10 gil to the boy
for that peek.. (this really unreasonable...) and watch for a funny
sequence ^_^;

Head right. Now you will be on a street. Notice! there is a girl, 
walking up to the shelter, actually that's the staircase which leads 
from the Pub.

You will meet 2 G-Soldiers and you will have to defeat them. [Win: 1x 
Potion, 2AP]. BTW, you will also get a Buel Card in the process. There

------------------------------------------------------------------------
________________________________________________________________________

There is also a Draw Point [Cure] located at the right of the Pub. Head 
up and entered the Pub after you has done with your shopping. At the 
Pub, you will see Rinoa turning mad [because that drunken fellow has
say that because of the resistance force, Timber will not be in this
mess.) After that short argument, you will find that the name of the
drunken man is called Drifter. Try to talk to him and you will be given
the following options

* Observe
* Talk to him -> choose this option and...

Persuading the drunken man ---------------------------------------------
 _________________________                            | Err, noticed 
| Buy him a drink         | Prices of Drinks (100 gil)| that the names
| Tell him about the card | Krakka  Mimett            | of the drinks
| Do Nothing              | Tantal  Reagen            | are actually...
|_________________________| Curiel  Sylkis            |
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick the second option [as you will be wasting your gil (You will be
wasting your gil if you treat him all the drinks except for the Reagen 
Drink)]. Remember the Buel Card, you found earlier, by doing this allows 
you to get the Tonberry Card. Next he will allow you to pass... anyway, 
he is too lazy to move ^_^;

Now the owner will tell the drunken man to make way for you. Now head
up and you will find a Save Point and a Draw Point [Scan]. Notice that
there are people up there.. actually it is from the window ^_^; Now
walk left and head up the winding stairs (need a lot of trouble in 
using D-Pad to move up..) and it will lead to a huge TV monitor. Now
this stirs up some argument between Squall and Rinoa.. (it was about
Rinoa management of her resistance force....) No matter what option you
choice, she will still leave you.. and Selphie or Zell (depends on your
selection) will come and rejoins your party. Now watch the monitor. 
There you will have a sequence of the minister talking about Galbadia (
actually it is a test speech ^_^;) followed by entrance of the real 
President Deling. He is announcing the Sorceress as their ambassador..
(what! Sorceresses are told to be a myth.. you can learn more if you have
read the Anarchist Monthly found on the notice board of the Forest 
Owl's HQ) and eventually more surprises will come... Seifer (is he 
doing for Rinoa?) will enter the screen and threaten to kill the 
President. Quistis is also there and she will tell everyone to head for 
the TV Station. (you have permission to head there...) Now head left 
and walk up the path, you find Seifer there, holding the President as 
the hostage. After a short conversation, he will then pull the 
President to a corner. (situation is really bad as Zell has revealed 
that they are from Garden..) At that corner, Quistis will come in, 
trying to stop Seifer from killing the President. A sense of mystery has
filled that area..

A mysterious lady appeared from thin air.... It is the Sorceress. She 
will try talk out with Seifer (keep on calling Seifer a boy...), 
causing him to drop the President and leave with her. Quistis, who has 
tried to stop her, but was injured in the process by her strong magic. 
(things don't look quite good ...)

Squall and his party will enter the place and was stopped in the 
process. Next Rinoa will be back at the area too. (she is asking what 
has happened?) Now you need to exit from the TV Station.. Deling will
eventually try to do something with the Gardens. Quistis and Rinoa 
decided that you need to head to somewhere safe... Follow her until you
have reach the pub..(everyone is a resistance force in the town...)
Remember the house next to Timber Maniacs? You will eventually ended up
there and you will find both of them. A short sequence will happen at 
the house (it is about Seifer..). Before you could finished the talk, 
Galbadians are here! You will be prompted to go upstairs.. Next talk to
Quistis twice and you need to head downstairs. [I can say that things
REALLY don't look good between Rinoa and Squall.. Wanna to know? Pay 
attention to the words..] Back at the first floor, attempt to exit and 
Quistis will ask Squall what to do? Squall suggest that they should 
head to the nearest Garden.. (the lady will also tell you it is better 
that you escape now as most of the Galbadians have left Timber...). 
You will be given the chance to re-organize your party. On the way out, 
the woman will give you a Phoenix Down, Potion, Soft, Antidote and a 
Remedy. Now you will see a Galbadian Soldier [that's Watts in 
disguise!] outside the house. You can ignore the soldier by keep going 
right [it does not make sense if you confront the soldier..]. There you 
will see Zone [dressed as an old man...] who will be distributing the 
ticket to Rinoa and 3 tickets to Squall. He will also forsake his ticket 
to Quistis and suggest a humorous place to hide!

Now enter the walkway, which is enclosed, by a shelter. Now you will be 
on the other side of the Timber. Here is Area V of Timber..

I guess a lot of *special* sequences occurred here. "X" occurs from Disc
2 onwards. You can do the Owl's Tears Quest now..

Owl's Tears Quest ------------------------------------------------------
If you have listen carefully to the words from the old lady at the 
Souvenirs Shop that the man whom has the Owl's Tears lives on the edge 
of the town.. Well, talk to him and he will tell you that he has already
sold the item (ow..). There is a cupboard found at the center of the
small house. Keep on pick the top option and you will eventually be able
to pick up 500 gil. (it actually the earnings that he had made by 
selling the item.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick Option 1 to enter the train. Your company will now be boarding on 
the train to Galbadia Garden. The train will now start to move. You are
to alight at East Academy Station... which is a station before the
Dollet Town Station.

Inside the train, talk to everyone and Zell last, picking the first 
option. Now you will be brought back to the World Map. You should find
the area like this:

The Border between Monterosa Plateau, Vaulny Canyon, Hasberry Plains

Laguna's Dream Sequence #2 - Centra Evacuation Site           ffviii_013

          Confuse - draw point at the right side of the evacuation site.
          Cure - draw point under boulder.

GF:       n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thrustaveis: Blizzard*, [Aero], {Scan -> Tornado}, Float 
Geezard: Thunder*, [Thundara*], Cure*, [Cura*] 
Cockatrice: Thunder*, Break (forests)
Wendigo: Berserk, [Protect] (forests)
Anacandour: Fire*, Cure*, [Bio] (forests)
Fungaur: Sleep, Scan, [Berserk], [Confuse]
Fastitcalon: Blizzard*, Sleep, [Water], Scan (shores)

Galbadia: Monterosa Plateau
Geezard: Thunder*, [Thundara*], Cure*, [Cura*]
Behelmel: Thunder*, [Berserk] > {Confuse}

Centra Evacuation Site
Esthar Soldier: Fire*, Thunder*, Blizzard*, Cure*
Esthar Soldier (Cyborg): Fire*, Thunder*, Blizzard*
Elastoid: Protect, Shell, Dispel
Gesper: Protect, Shell

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is time back to the Dream World.. folks. Laguna and his friends will
have a short meeting in front of their destination. This time they were
asked to investigate an evacuation site, which is being occupied by 
Esthar, an enemy of Galbadia. Laguna has forgotten to bring the map 
^_^; Now it is time.. check your equipment as if you haven't junction 
GF on Quistis or Selphie. Just pick any option during the conversation

Well, you will ended up at the evacuation site.. find a draw point [
Sleep] near the walkway. After a short chit-chat, Esthar soldiers 
started to come in.. you will meet up with 4 Esthar Soldiers [colourful 
clothing .. huh?] and it is a fight. The first fight will result a 
back-attack status, which allows you to head on against 1x Esthar 
Soldier [don't worry as they are quite easy just G-Soldiers, in fact 
that they have same draw spells]. BTW, at this moment of time, I was be 
able to receive advanced draw spells such as Blizzara, Fira, Thundara 
and Cura [if it does apply for your case, stock them just like what you 
did in when you battle G-Soldiers in Dollet, Squall's level is already
Level 20.]. If not, level up your characters now. Remember to junction
Thunder* to Elem-Atk-J as most monsters here are mechanical beasts.

Cyborgs?
I think I have missed this important facet. In fact that there are two
type of Esthar Soldiers [just G-Soldiers and Elite Soldiers of 
Galbadia]. It also applies to Esthar Soldiers.. the name is the same 
as Esthar Soldier but you can noticed it if:
- you can only draw Fire*, Thunder*, Blizzard* from it
- It has an additional move called "Boomerang Sword"
- It is weak against Thunder instead of Poison.
- It has black and dark blue ribs [different colouring, it looks dull]

After that easy battle, this time is 3 on 3 along with 3x Esthar
Soldiers [nab: 3x Potions, 3 AP]. After the battle, err.. which way
to go.

! Right Path [the faster way...]
You will find a ladder there.. climb down and Laguna will experience
a leg cramp. Kiros and Ward will asked Laguna whether he is ok or not.
Next proceed until you reach a huge pipe.

! Left Path/Main Path [the longer way and more stuffs...]
Enter and you ended up at a three-way path.. The right path leads to a
draw Point [Confuse] and the middle leads to the ladder. Head there and
climb down. You will end up with an area with a reactor... proceed. Now
you find three trap doors.. the second one can be tempered with it (
choose the top option to do so.. Don't be silly to walk back as you set
the trap yourself) Proceed and it will be a clear path.. keep on moving
and you will end up at the huge pipe.

Search the area and you will find an item [Old Key], however Laguna 
loses because his back pocket got a hole ^_^; (really careless...) Now
walk up and you will find an area with a pit on the left and there is
a crystallized barrier.. (you can walk past it and ended up at a 
deserted area, which is a short cut to the Save Point, where you are
supposed to head to..). Walk and you will find a torpedo-like 
structure, that's the detonator. You can mended with it by choosing the
1st and 2nd option. Move up and examine the boulder, which will uncover
a draw point [Cure] in the process. In the next area, you will find an 
extremely long metal bridge. Walk across and you will ended up at the 
area where you find the Save Point (the pipe leads to the deserted 
area.) Save your game and make necessary preparations before the 
battle. BTW, within this area, it is very easy to encounter the Gesper,
you can get Black Hole from it, which allows Quistis to learn the 
Degenarator (instant killer weapon!) and the Elastoid (couple of great 
items, with you are lucky, you may get the Laser Cannon, which allows 
Quistis to learn Homing Laser). Head and you will find a cliff.. of 
course got interrupted and you will battle 1x Esthar Soldier (nab: 1x 
Potion, 1 AP) and eventually 2x Esthar Soldiers "Cyborg!" (nab 2x
Potion). Upon the defeat of the last "Cyborg" Esthar Soldier, he will
use a move called the Soul Crush, which reduces both Ward and Kiros'
HP to 1.. Now Laguna, along with his wounded members, discussed what
to do ^_^; (they are going to be fine..). Laguna tell them that there is
a boat below which means that they can get back to Galbadia! So Laguna
give them a faster trip.. and he himself too ^_^;............

Awaken? You will find Zell and Rinoa ask the remainding how they feel.
Zell will then tell you after this forest, they should reach Galbadia
Garden. Now if you check the stats of Quistis and Selphie, their HP has
dropped to 1... Use a tent and save your game. 

More about the Excavation Site.
About the last fight, at the cliff, actually the max number of battles, 
you will get to fight against Esthar soldiers is 5: 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2, 
and it can be reduced to only 1.

The number of battles depends on what you did or didn't do along the 
way. Basically, every time you get to see Esthar Soldiers running away 
or falling in traps reduces the number of battles by one.

Here's how to get rid of each:
First battle: Tamper with the trap door.
Second battle: Detonating the rock near the detonator.
Third battle: Detonating the rock far from the detonator.
Fourth Battle: Pushing the rock where the [Cure] Draw point is hidden.

Now, you get to fight only once against 2 Esthar Soldiers before your 
party gets Soul Crushed.

Also, there are 2 [old keys], one near the pipes in the screen not far 
after climbing down the stairs in the right path(about 2 screens later),
and another in the screen after climbing down the stairs in the left 
path (a small path that goes towards the camera), search the left wall.

You get to see Laguna drop the key in a different way each.

Galbadia Garden                                               ffviii_014

          Life - locker room found near hockey field
          Shell - Athletic Track

Geezard - Thunder*, [Thundara*], Cure*, [Cura*]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Better use a Tent before you proceed. It is rather far from the Garden.
[as Quistis and Selphie also wounded during that "dream" sequence.] In
this area, there are lots of monster, especially in the other areas.
You can nab Steel Orbs or Steel Pipes from the Wendigos, nab Corel 
Fragment, which allows Quistis to learn a new Blue Magic, Electrocoute.
[this pretty though.. but you can get that item easily at the later
section], you can find a wide range of monsters here and most of them
offers lots of AP. Better get GF Diablos and Mug Ability if you have
not done so [I know it is time consuming but it is worth it]. Refer to
Section 3.6 for more details.

Enter the Garden and you will be overwhelm by the fantastic CGI..
You will find a winding path in front enter and its leads you to the
Central Gate of Galbadia Garden. Quistis says that she knows the
headmaster here quite well, so she will be head there to talk to him.
If she is in your party, she will leave temporarily. Get a replacement.
Now enter and you will reach the main hall. It is being split in
4 ways. There is a Save Point located south and a draw point [Haste]
hidden under the golden light. Here is a brief description. Note the
moment you enter the Garden, you will receive a message telling
students from Balamb Garden to head to the 2F Receptionist room. Before
that you may wish to navigate the area...

===================
-----1ST Floor-----
===================

THE SOUTH PATH: Leads to the Central Gate of the Galbadia Garden. It 
                works like Balamb Garden, but it has more gates.
The LEFT PATH:  Leads to the lecture theatre and there is guard on the 
                left. [this place is really huge and there is a lot
                of areas inaccessible as you need to get the KeyCards]
The RIGHT PATH: There are total of 2 doors here. The room on the right
                have three card players [they also talk about the GF 
                cards and the strongest cards..]. While the room on 
                the left is the hockey field / skating compound. 
                Presently you can't get the Draw Point that's within 
                the skating compound. [for it is blocked..] Head up 
                the left door at the north, you find a guy plus 
                another Draw Point. [Life] (Gosh.. I could only say 
                that this place is just too mysterious...)
The NORTH PATH: There is a guard guarding the door. Head up and you 
                will find an instructor guiding some cadets doing 
                push-ups. (the guy nearest doing push-ups...). The
                staircase leads to the 2F (hey what am I saying,
                stairs always take you to the 2F..). Proceed north
                and you will reach an area. Head north again and you
                ended at the Athletic track... you will find another
                Draw point [Shell] there..

===================
-----2ND Floor-----
===================

The LEFT PATH:     Leads to the elevator, nothing else is found here. 
                   It is only accessible if you have the Key Card #3
The RIGHT PATH:    Leads to the circular path that's located directly
                   above the main hall. There is an Auditorium within 
                   this area. You will find another Draw Point near the 
                   stand [Double]. A hidden save point in this area, if 
                   you have used Siren's Move-Find ability.
Receptionist Room: There is a guard guarding the room. ENTER this room!
________________________________________________________________________

You have a sequence between your party. Talk to Zell, attempts to exit 
and you will meet up with Quistis. After seeing this, talk to Rinoa 
who is at the lower end of the room. After a short talk, converse 
with Selphie and you have some more conversation between the party. 
Next Squall will exit from the room, looks pretty angry and jealous....
(guess what Rinoa has a crush on Seifer, others took pity on him...
want to know why? Read Section 3.7 for more details)

Head down the stairs. Did you noticed that Zell is training along with 
the cadets, doing push-ups? Next exit from the area and you will meet 
up with Seifer's pals, Fujin and Raijin. They questioned Squall about 
something and why Seifer is not here. After that short chat, head for 
the Central Gate. At the gate, you will meet Quistis and exit from the 
area, talk to her and your members will head for the walkway at the 
entrance of the Galbadia Garden. Talk to Rinoa, whom is sitting on the 
edge. Next you will meet Martine (that's the headmaster of Galbadia 
Garden) who will be approaching your party in a vehicle. Notice that 
Rinoa isn't quite familiar with the SeeD way of addressing fellow SeeD 
members. (well for she is not a member of the SeeD..) Next the Martine 
will introduce you a new member, Irvine Kinneas in a cool CGI! 

There, your members will try to know Irvine better. Talk to Selphie and
you will have a sequence of her and Rinoa holding onto Irvine and leave.
Squall looks a bit gloomy about this. (coz, Irvine makes the decision 
himself) ^_^; you can change this by picking the option "I decide". And
you will have a tutorial and it is about Switch Tutorial.. Besides it
is the last Tutorial... Err want to know what mission does Martine has
handled to Squall? Well, it is an assassination plan against the 
Sorceress! [things don't looks good..]

Now you will back at the World Map with Zell and Quistis or customized 
if you have do the trick above. Now enter the train station that's 
located northwest from the Garden [it is known as the Far East Galbadia
Station...]. Next proceed towards the train attendant and pay 3,000 gil 
for the fee. You party will assemble at the main cabin of the train. 
Next Rinoa and Selphie will enter together with Irvine. (or the 
remainding party) As usual, the cheerful Selphie will enter the door 
and sang her song. Irvine will follow her. Proceed there and you will 
have another sequence. Next talk to Selphie and exit. Next you have 
another short talk and the screen will switch to the World Map and the 
train will take you to Deling City where you have been there in the
dream world.

The Quest at the Tomb of Unknown King                         ffviii_015
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:     1x Timber Maniacs, 16x G-Hi-Potion, 8x G-Returner, Sacred's 
           Card, Minotaur's Card
Magic:     Thundara - draw point located on the street left from 
           Caraway's Mansion.
           Protect - draw point located at the front of Tomb
           Float - draw point at the northern area of Tomb
           Cura - draw point at the western area of the Tomb
Save Pts:  Tomb of Unknown King - front yard of tomb
GF:        Brothers
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow... after that long trip, we have finally reached Deling City..
Now head down the escalator. Now you should have a sequence between your
party. (err.. Rinoa seems to know much about here.. as she know about
taking what bus <if she is in your party>) Next head north and you will
reach the fountain Area or Deling Train Station. A bit special about
this city is that you can take buses found in this city from one place
to another. To get on the bus, you need to find a bus stop [there is a 
bus attendant dressed in green for every bus stops]. Wait for the bus to
come and pick the first option. Now talk to the bus attendant located
south of the fountain.[you will see it immediately as you enter the
area.] Now talk to the attendant and pick the first option to board the
bus. [BTW, you will also be told by the attendant where the bus head...

Take the bus and choose to alight during the next stop. (The moment that 
the bus has reach the next stop [the road is marked by 09]) Press 
Triangle to alight. Now talk to the Galbadia Solider on the extreme 
right. [he is rather difficult to find] 

Talk to him and he asked for a password (because the General wants to 
test your ability). Next he will talk about the Tomb of the Unknown 
King, which is located northwest from the city. Next he will give you 
the map. You can use this map and also exit by activating it and press 
Triangle to exit (but this lowers your SeeD ranking!) and he will also 
give you the following options.

Ready to answer
Buy a hint for 3,000 gil
Buy a location displayer for 5,000 gil 
Talk
Have him escort us out of town

Pick the fifth one and you will be brought to the area where you find
the "Rent A Car" Shop. I suggest that you better rent a car as it is
safer and the tomb is quite far from the city [it is on the grasslands,
not the deserts!]. Just board and head northwest and you will find the
tomb where the Galbadia soldier has told you to head for.

Deling City Sections ---------------------------------------------------

1.  Deling Fountain Train Station.
    The first area where Laguna and his party has landed. There
    are two bus attendants around this area. Left path leads to the
    Caraway's Mansion. The right path leads to the deserted the corner.
    The north path leads to the Galbadia Hotel.

2.  General Caraway's Mansion
    The area where you will find the attendant in front of the Mansion. 
    The Left path leads to the Gateway. There you will find another 
    Draw Point. [Thundara] There are also two bus attendants here. 
    North leads to the Deling City Station. South leads to President's
    Residence.

3.  Shopping Arcade
    This is REALLY a busy street. This road is infested with vehicles 
    and there are a huge group of people. On the right, you will find 
    the Junk shop [yellow signboard] and Deling Shop [orange signboard]
    Here is the shopping list of Deling Shop

North: Leads to Galbadia Hotel
South: Leads to the President's Residence.

4.  The Gateway
    The most significant sight is the huge structure and it is 
    enormous. There is a 3-way junction, which leads to the other parts 
    of the town. 
    Right: the isolated park lane that leads to General's Mansion
    North: the path that leads to the President's Residence
    South: leads to the compound and parks that leads to the General
    Mansion

5.  President's Residence
    You will find 2 bus attendants here and south is the President's
    mansion. Here are the directions:
    - North: leads to the gateway
    - Right: leads to the General Caraway's Mansion.
    - West:  leads to the Shopping Arcade 

6.  Galbadia's Hotel street
    The Hotel where Laguna and Julia met.. the club is presently not
    operating any more. There is a Save Point found here. Pay 100 gil
    and you can get a Timber Maniacs that is found near the bed inside
    the Hotel Room 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one very important information.. I need to tell you guys. That 
is to defeat the next BOSS, you must have gotten Squall's Shear Trigger
which allows Squall to gain an addition Fated Circle. To get that you
must get the 1x Steel Pipe and 3x Screws. Screws can be gotten from the
Geezard and Steel Pipes can be stolen from the Wendigo. Next just head 
to Deling's Junk Shop to remodel Squall's gunblade. It is also crucial
for you to get more advance spells such as Fira, Blizzara, Thundara and
Cura. You can get Aero if your levels are high enough and junctioned it
to your characters' Elem-Atk. Also get about 20x Floats from the 
Thrustaevis. The tomb is located shown in this map:

    Missile               D-District         I guess you guys should
     Base                   Prison           know why ^_^;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      
As you have arrived at the tomb, you find two girls [looking like 
Galbadia Garden cadets] running away from the tomb. Are there ghosts in 
the tomb? Just kidding..^_^; Always pay attention to speeches as they
give you hints.. like the girl mentioned Float.. You can find a Save 
Point on the right and a Draw Point on the left. [Protect] Cross the 
bridge and enter the tomb.

The Tomb has indeed a very complex layout (more like a maze..). To view 
the map that the attendant has previously given to you, press SELECT to 
view it while you are at the Tomb. 

Here is the map [hope that it isn't very difficult to read ^_^]:

Be on your guard at all times while at the tomb. The monsters found 
here are quite tough and have good protection spells such as Protect
and Shell. [Stock them up as you need for it later in the game, for
providing defensive purposes. As you enter the tomb for the first time,
you will be on a straightforward path. Straight paths are important 
as they will lead to special areas [providing me with help on how to
proceed onwards.] Proceed forward and you will be at a junction with
a gunblade on the ground. Examine the gunblade and you will get a 
number [I got the no. 016 and the number changes every time you replayed
the game]. Next take the right path of the junction. NOTE: ALWAYS turn
right whenever you have came to junction, so that you will NEVER get 
lost. This section isn't compulsory but you can get GF Brothers from
this section. Keep on turning right until you ended up on a straight
path. There you will see Sacred of the Brothers. Yikes! It moved! There
you will have to battle against Sacred of the Brothers.. Another BOSS
fight!

Strategy
This GF is quite difficult for those with low levels [I mean if you have
gotten those spells, I have mentioned earlier]. This GF has only one
attack, but it was the regeneration that makes it difficult. It is the
Earth-powered GF. To defeat it, just cast Float on the BOSS and this 
will stop the regeneration of HP. Next just summoned GFs to finish it
off (Diablos and Siren works quite well on the BOSS). To inflict more
damage for those whom want to use attacks, junction 100x Aero to your
characters' Elem-Atk-J. Here is one great comment from Sacred:

"THEY'RE PRETTY STRONG"
========================================================================

Now the Sacred will ran away from the area and head for the hideout 
[marked at the center of the map]. Return back to the junction and keep
on turning right and you will end up at the North area of the Tomb. 
There you will see a river and a ledge have blocked it off. 
Examine the right side of the chain using the X button and water
will flow out from the barrier. Also draw magic from the Draw Point
located at the left [Float]

Next head north and keep turning right at the junctions and you will
lead to another straight but broken path. There you find a lever on
the left and some gears. Now press X to activate the gears and
water will flow in. Now you have activate the bridge leading to their
hideout. [Draw Point located on the right (hidden) and you can stock
up magic Cura from it].

Now continue to turn right and you will find a straight path... that
leads to the entrance of the Tomb. Next exit from the Tomb and save
your game and use a Tent. Now re-enter and head north.. you will find
a green enclosed area.. that's the Brothers' Hideout. At the hideout,
you will meet both Brothers.. Sacred will call for his big brother,
Minotaur [^_^; the elder brother is the small one...]

Strategy
This battle WILL be rather tough if you are at low levels (below level
19 is consider low..) Make sure that you have gotten intermediate spells
such as Fira, Blizzara, Cura and Thundara. Also make sure you have met
the below requirements:

 100x Aero- junctioned Elem-Atk-J
 100x Thundara/Fira/Blizzara - junction Str-J [make you have at least
 three Str-J]
 20x Float
 100x Cura (all characters for restoring HP)
 100x Life (for restoring HP)
 Draw Commands for all characters.
 Selphie with Full-cure learnt
 Squall with Shear Trigger -> Fated Circle.

Selphie is a crucial member for this fight. Make sure you have gotten 
the Mug Ability so that you can get Iron Pipes for Squall's Shear
Trigger. Stock up Double from Minotaur (should not failed if you have
junctioned a secondary spell to the character's Mag-J). Cast Double
for all characters so to brought effective healing [Minotaur has an
attack that inflict damage to all.] Hopefully that you have stocked
up sufficient Cura from the Geezard. Cast Float on the Brothers to 
remove the "earth regeneration". Keep Squall's HP at low.. whereas
concentrate on two other members. [maintain them above 500+ HP]. Once
Squall's HP is low, have him using Renzoukuken. and don't cure until he
dies. Have one member to draw Life and cast on Squall [don't cure so 
that you can use Renzoukuken every turn..]. Have the other members stock
up Double. Cast Protect on all characters as the Brothers uses physical
attacks. Beware of the Maw Cow Special. Just have the other characters
summon GFs.
 
========================================================================

After you have defeat the "two bulls", you will be allow to name the GF
Brothers. Next you will meet the spirit of the King and he will give the
Minotaur's Card. Exit from the Tomb. (just walk south will do..) Now it 
is time to head back to Deling.. Give GF Brothers some decent training,
acquired Boost before returning..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, you back at Galbadia... (you will also know the importance of
cars..). Next it is time to head back to Deling Train Station. Just 
simply walk up and head right. Talk to the train attendant and board 
the bus back to Caraway's Residence. Now talk to the guard and tell 
him your password. Let's says if the pin is 016, press 6, 1, 0 in this 
order]. If you have entered the pin correctly, you will be able to 
head for the mansion. There is a Save Point here. Save your game.

Enter the mansion. Once in the mansion talk to Rinoa, and she will 
talk to Squall for a while (the general is always like that... and she
is the daughter of the General?). After a while, General Caraway will 
enter the hall and greet you and brief you about your mission. If 
Rinoa is in your party, she will leave your party and you will have to 
re-organize. [well, her father thinks that the mission is too 
dangerous for her...] Well. You will be taking a course around Deling
where you will brief you about this... Next he will tell you more 
about the mission. Your group will be divided into two teams.

- Gateway Team: The Gateway team will be the one that close down the
  gates of the Gateway to trap the Sorceress inside the Gateway at
  the time 20:00...
- Sniper Team: The team are supposed to seek inside the President's
  mansion.. during the parade and head inside the hatch found in
  the corridor. Next they are supposed to enter the hatch, and the
  path will lead to the carousel clock where they can find a sniper
  rifle there. When the clock tower hits 20:00, it is BANG!

Well... next he will bring you to the Clock Tower where next he will
tell you to make the necessary preparations for the battle. Now 
browse around and head back to the Residence. Next you will there be
assigned into two times. The leader and the sniper will be at one team,
well it is Squall and Irvine whereas the remainding guys will be for
the Gateway team.. (well a disappointment act for Zell ^_^;)

Now you will be regaining control of Quistis and company.. Just exit
from the area and they will meet up with Rinoa and Rinoa told her that
she has find a item that can constrain the Sorceress' magic by putting
the Odine Bangle on the Sorceress.. Of course Quistis will bombard her
with a series of questions..(quite mean..)

The screen will changes back to Squall, noticed that the streets has 
becoming crowded of sudden. They are going to welcome the Sorceress, 
the person whom you are looking for. [so the Sorceress' name is called
Edea] Simply follow Caraway and you will end up at the President's 
Residence. [note that the street now should be rather crowded. Walk 
towards the left end of the crowd and exit the screen. (not towards the
gateway!)] Now the screen will now switches back to Quistis and her 
party. Quistis want to apologize to Rinoa.. Now head back to the 
mansion through the right path from the Gateway. Next you will have a 
sequence between Rinoa and her father. (Caraway is trying to lock 
Rinoa up in the room) Rinoa will leave the mansion and head on her 
own... Meanwhile, Quistis and her party comes back and found that the 
door was locked! It seems that they have gotten themselves into this
mess ^_^;

At the President's Residence
You will now gain control of Rinoa. There is a Save Point on the left.
Observe that there is a grey manhole here.. examine the manhole and
choose to go.. Move left thrice and you will find the Weapon Mon May.
Head back and now you will have to do some climbing. Head to the crate 
and press X. Climb up until you reach the ledge. Head left.

In this area, head for the ladder located on the left extreme side
of the building. Now head up to the ceiling and Rinoa will reach the 
building. (she actually stammers..) There is a chair in front of you. 
Proceed and examine it ... KA-Boom ! Rinoa was injured by Edea and 
Rinoa is then risen into mid-air... followed by a CGI..

Edea talks for a while (err isn't her on the side of President Deling?). 
Delivering a magic blow on the President, causing the President lying 
dead on the ground. Irvine spotted Rinoa and both of them think why 
Rinoa's up there!? Edea proceed to the hall and raises her hand, 
summoning monsters! (she wants to offer Rinoa as a sacrifice..)

Irvine will try to persuade Squall that they have to enter the mansion
or Rinoa will be doomed.. Squall will talk to Irvine that the gate has
not opened yet. 

The screen switches back to Quistis and her company. Now you have to 
find a way to get so that you can help Squall and Irvine... and carry
on the mission. Look closely on the painting on the right. It's a 
statue of girl holding a glass. On the extreme top-left hand corner is 
also a statue of a girl. So to make it the same, get a glass from the 
cabinet next to the statue and press X to place it on the statue. It 
will then reveal a trap door! Enter the trap door and head down to the 
basement. There is a Save Point. To climb onto structures such as 
ladders, press X to examine it, press up and down to move. Remember to
Junction GFs...

Now go down through the ladder and onto the wooden platform next to 
the gear and press X, Quistis and her company will be able to
reach the other side of the basement. Head up and you will have 
another CGI (the parade has start!)

Moving towards President's Residence..
Now you will be able to move during intervals. Just follow Irvine. and 
seek into the building. Equip Irvine and Squall with GFs as everything 
will be reset. Now, climb up the crates, following Rinoa's suit. Use 
the Save Point if needed. Now after you have climb onto the ceiling, try 
to move Squall towards the edge of the main building. Head for the door! 
You will find the President lying on the ground. In the next area, you 
will find a hatch located on the right of the red carpet. Ignore and 
proceed to the room. There you will see the unarmed Rinoa being attacked 
by those two monsters and you will have to fight them!

Strategy

At this time, you can only have Squall and Irvine in your party. Use
all GFs except for Ifrit. If low on HP, draw some healing spells (draw
Cure* from the BOSS..) and this should not be tough (anyway it is not
tough ^_^;). Beware of the BOSS' Magma Breath as it could turn one of 
your members into stone (Petrify, you will see a countdown of 20..]. To 
counter with that status disorder, use Esuna, which can be drawn from 
the BOSS. Remember to draw Carbuncle from them ! Note that you can only 
draw once. For the case of Irvine, his Limit Breaks are only usable if 
you have Ammo in your stock [they can be brought shops in Deling Shop 
and Timber Shop]. Summoning Brothers with the "Boost" support will be a 
good idea. Hopefully that Squall has stocked up enough Double magic to 
provide effective healing. GFs can be recovered.. really sorry. I have
found the way and the method is mentioned in my site. But still it is
better to draw it now as it is going to be a long time..

========================================================================

After defeating the BOSS, Squall will try to help Rinoa. Rinoa will keep 
on hanging onto Squall's sleeve. Is there something wrong with Rinoa? [
Well she is very terrified..] Exit from this area and head for the 
hatch, examine it and you will eventually reached the destination, 
where the General has told you to head. Now examine the rifle that's 
on the left of entrance and you will have a short event. [hey guys, did
you see Seifer in CGI?].. Well here is a piece of bad news: Irvine is
afraid! Now switches back to Quistis and her company....

Deling City Sewers.....

This section is tough. I have lost my way quite a few times. Writing a 
precise guide will make you more confused. So I will try to give out the 
hints to this section:

1.   Note that you can walk across gears, by examining them, pressing 
     the X button. The gears are turning in a certain direction either 
     clockwise nor anti-clockwise. If you want to cross the gear from 
     left to right, find a gear that is moving clockwise.
3.   There are only three Draw Points found here. 
     [Esuna] - is located near a gear... need to knock a ladder..
     [Zombie] - it requires you to go to the other side..
     [Bio] - it is located southeast from the Zombie draw point plus
     it is hidden. Need to use Move-Find ability.
4.   You can open some of the doors in this section.
5.   If you cannot proceed further, then you are on the wrong track.
6.   Try to nab some Corel Fragment from the Creeps as it allows Quistis
     to learn a new Limit Break.

At the beginning of the path, you find that you can only walk along the 
path on the left. Actually the destination is on the RIGHT end of the
Sewers... At the end of the sewers, you will find a Save Point. Climb up 
that ladder. Now you will reach an area with a door. Press X at the 
ladder, pick the first option and you will reach the area where you will 
find a small window. Zell will look through the hole and followed by a 
short CGI.. the clock has hit 20:00! Now push the switch [looks like a 
telephone] and you will have another great CGI..

Squall will try to persuade Irvine to take the shot. Take it as a trial
run.. Bang! Irvine's shot is very accurate, but it was deflected by 
Edea's powerful magic. Squall will say a few words (which means that he
is going down.. looks like he has to face Seifer...) and you will be 
shown the menu. Equip all GFs on Squall, Rinoa and Irvine before 
pressing Triangle to exit and it will be followed by a CGI

A short talk with Edea, Seifer and Squall. Squall battles on Seifer one 
on one... IT'S REVENGE TIME!

Strategy
This battle, you can only control Squall, but this would not be tough. 
If you are lack of HP, just draw Cure* from Seifer and use it for 
yourself. You can even dealt a finishing blow with a GF... Seifer is 
pretty weak... Take this opportunity to stock up Life Magic.

After the battle, Seifer will be wounded and knelt down. Next you will
have to fight Edea, the final BOSS of Disc 1! During the battle, both 
Rinoa and Irvine will come forward to aid you... (well, Rinoa felt that

missed shot...)

Strategy
This BOSS is very tough. She has very damaging magic such as Firaga and 
Blizzaga. Her magic does damage about 300+. Draw some magic from her and 
use it for your own use. Use attack, special moves, GF to dish out 
damage. There is an easy way of defeating her. Make sure that your party 
is being healed to full health and then cast Carbuncle on your entire 
party. Now all the magic spell will be reflect onto her. Or she will 
waste her turns in casting Dispel to break off the Reflect status for 
each party member. [seize this opportunity to summon GFs] If you have 
the Reflect status, and want to heal your HP, uses Potions. Cast Double 
on two members to provide effective healing. [also stock Double in the
process, make sure you have Item as your fourth command in case you need
to restore HP using items.

Next you will have ending CGI for Disc 1.. Squall is injured by ...

           Dispel - draw point near the river of the main compound.
           Drain - draw point near the florist shop [residence].
           Reflect - draw point near the truck.

GFs:       n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WinHill [during this dream sequence]
Bitebug   - Fira*, Scan
Caterchipillar - Thundara*, Cura*, Slow, {Stop}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Laguna and Kiro's Clothing..
They have changed! Finally from those sloppy Galbadian battle outfits!
Laguna is wearing his casual clothes and Kiros too.. Ward however is not
here.. Want to know why? Get the game and play it!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The screen will now switches back to our favourite and humorous Laguna,
who is talking to a little girl called Ellone. Ellone will talk to 
Laguna for a while and head downstairs. [they are supposed to meet a
person but it is very dangerous out there..]. There is a Save Point 
found in the second floor of the house. Hidden within the cupboard 
located in the north is a Draw Point. Draw some magic [Curaga] before 
heading downstairs. Talk to Ellone, which is followed by a sequence..
Laguna will be admiring the photo.. Now head for the Pub that's located
on the left of the house. Make sure that you have check your junctions
before walk past as the area is prone to monsters and Laguna will tell
Ellone that it is safe to walk past.

Now talk to the girl dressed in yellow. Her name is Raine and she will 
tell Laguna that they have a visitor.. It is Kiros! Noticed that the huge
guy is no longer around... Next you will given the following options.

... What's Ward up to? (he is taking an unusual job..)
... Tell me about Julia (well, for those whom are interested in Laguna's
    love life.. Julia is a songtress and her famous song is Eyes on Me!)
... Where am I? (this question is a bit strange...meant for Squall)
... Let's talk later

Pick the fourth option Now Kiros will re-join your party and you will be
asked to walk down the streets of Winhill, excriminate Bite Bugs and 
Caterchipillar. I guess your character should have reached level 20+,
that's why I have put Cura instead of Cure. Well, the monsters has also
additional skills.. e.g. the Caterchipillar may use a Sticky Web move,
whereas the Bite Bug uses a Fart attack..

Head out and walk across the compound of Winhill. You will find a Draw 
Point [Dispel] if you go down the stairs near the river. The main 
compound is basically conversations about the legendary (well, for their
time, Esthar is the bad foe..) Esthar and Galbadia. Ellone has some 
special powers and will be adducted by the President (Sorceress Adel..
yeah, it is a Sorceress...). Check your junctions. Don't panic if you
haven't gotten all GFs. In my last attempt, I have purposely missed the
Carbuncle and Siren. which means I can't use ST-Atk-J. But it does not
mean you can't use Elem-Atk-J ^_^; [junction Blizzard* to your elemental
junction and remember to watch out for Laguna and Kiros' Limit Breaks.]

Now head back and cross the bridge. You will have an event here. You 
need do some patrolling along the village. Now head south to exit the 
area. Now walk down the lane. You will find a florist shop on the left 
and there is a Draw Point [Drain] near the yellow board. Next head right.
[this move is essential as you wouldn't be able to access it later..] 
You will find a truck near the hill slope. Press X near the truck and 
it will uncover another Draw Point, draw some more magic [Reflect] from 
it and head down the slope. Head left. You will be at the lower end of 
the town. The house on the top-left is just a villager's house. The 
right side is the hotel and the Flower Restaurant [currently, there is
no one here, BTW the stay in here is free!]. The shop at the southwest 
is an Item Shop, purchase some items. [use all 3,000 gil since it is the
'past money' and does not affect your current cash..] Then you will 
have another sequence, your job is done! Now head back to the upper-part 
through north. Note that you can't take the winding road, Laguna is 
rather a superstitious guy... Now head up and you will be on a road with 
the signboard that's says "CAUTION" and you will have another sequence. 
[it is about Raine's relationship with Laguna] Head up and you will be 
back at the road where you find the florist shop [of course, you will 
have more chit-chat, BTW, don't expect the journey be so smooth as you
will be facing monsters ^_^;]. BTW, here is the shopping list..

Now head for the pub and up the stairs to the second floor. You will 
have another sequence there... [same here, Raine is also in love in 
Laguna.. oh.. what an headache? Well, did I sound like Squall? Always
kept to one's thought..). Next Raine will tell Laguna to rest at the 
room.

There is another sequence with Ellone if you talk to her. Next head back 
to the house where you found the Save Point. Save your game. Now head to 
the bed and choose Option No. 1. Laguna will talk to Kiros and you will 
be transported back to Squall's time. (hmm.. did you ask this question?
who is responsible for this dream? Interested? play on...)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you will be back at the D-District Prison.. where Zell, Selphie, 
Quistis and Rinoa were being held captive. Now you will be able to 
control Zell [he has just woke up from the dream world.. he is Ward in
the dreams.. as a janitor!] Talk to everyone. Now talk to Rinoa and you 
will have a short talk... (more like Zell know the place, where Ward 
was once here..)

The screen will now switches back to Squall whom is held in a portable
cell, which is brought up to the 13th floor. Squall opened his eyes, but 
still severely injured. [however no wounds.., Edea's Ice Strike is 
really strong huh?] Then you will have an CGI...

Now you will switch back to the 7th floor, where Zell and his friends
are. Next three guards will come in and they started to beat up Zell.
One of them is named the Mean Guy ^_^;. Those ruthless guards just keep 
on kicking Zell. The guards are asking for Rinoa [Actually the General 
has asked the Galbadia Army to release her only]. Eventually, Rinoa 
will leave with the guards. Then the screen fades...

Now it switches back to the wounded Squall. The door opened and come in 
an angry Seifer. He just keeps on beating the injured Squall. After a 
while, 2 orange beasts [Moomba] enter the cell and take Squall away...

Squall will be then locked up onto a wall and being tortured by his
rival Seifer. The torture looks scary, charging up Squall with electric 
bolts. Seifer now works for Edea the Sorceress as the Sorceress Knight,
which is his dreams...] and he is questioning about SeeD.. [Err... he 
should know this, doesn't he stay in Balamb Garden?] Chicken-wuuss...

Meanwhile, the screen switches back to Zell whom is being healed by 
Selphie, She actually draws from Zell.[don't worry, nothing happens to 
your inventory.] However there is anti-magic field.... So your magic 
isn't that useful.. Next a Moomba will come in with a manhole cover [
well, it looks like one.]. Next it will be bullied by the Mean Guy..
[I can tell that Zell is very, very angry about him..] Next you will 
given the following options. The mean guy will leave eventually no
matter what option you choose.

I'll stop him! -> choose this one, which is better.
There is no use..

Squall will be receiving torture, and is still being questioned about 
SeeD. BTW, Did you know that Edea is planning to destroy all the 
Gardens? Seifer will leave and the assistant will continue the torture..
and you will given the following options:

Just let me die -> be a brave warrior, choose this!
I'll lie.. I must.. live.. -> flowers anyone?

Now you will be back to Zell and company. Talk to Quistis and you have 
another talk. [they are planning to escape, well that's a bit stupid of
me, what can be their other alternatives ^_^]. You need to get back the
weapons in order to break free... Now your party will now fake death, 
while Zell talk to the guard. Zell then punches up the guard. Well, he 
is really that powerful. Then the Moomba will talk to Zell. [it wants to
tag along and it could lead the way for Zell.]

Your aim is to snatch back the weapons, which are located on the 8F. So 
Head there through the staircase on the right (Err.. remember to check 
your junction!) You will find two Guards [they are not normal 
G-Soldiers as they uses Status attacks.] examining your weapons and 
admiring Squall's precious gunblade. Now approach them and you have to 
fight them. Here is one cheap technique.. cast Sleep on both of them... 
and stock up Sleep. Next just use GFs and you will be able to finish 
them easily. [it is no sweat.] The screen will then fade, back the cell. 
The screen will now switches back to Squall whom was being saved the 
three Moombas. They just keep on calling Laguna [Of course, Squall will 
generally be amazed by the fact...]

Now everyone will have their weapons. Watch some fancy moves performed 
by each of them. [the last one is a bit too funny ^_^;] The guards will 
enter and followed by Lieutenant Biggs and Private Wedge. [why I 
mentioned the ranks? you will know why during the conversation at the
battles.] You will have to fight them.

Remember why I ask you to stock up Sleep? Here is its usage, it is    | 
time to stock up the precious spell, Regen [a good spell for          |
junctioned compared to Double..]. Don't attack them too quickly. It   |
will be easier if you have acquired GF Siren [don't worry, you can    |
still get it back but it will be in Disc 4..]. As you see they should |
not pose such as problem, just summon GFs during their dream world.   |
Also pay attention to the interesting and humorous speeches.. BTW,    |
what is the level below Lieutenant?                                   |
______________________________________________________________________|

After defeating those two punkies, exit the area. Then Biggs will 
sound the alarm! (well, he did that again) Now you will see Moomba 
meeting his pals and starts to follow them. Now you need to head for 
13F, where Squall is being held captive. There are ledges that 
blocked at one side of the stairs. This means that you have to walk 
around the contour. BTW, remember to stock Haste from the GIM52A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before going up, be sure to navigate around for goodies. It is like a 
treasure hunt! Yahoo! You can access all the floors found here. But
afterwards, you can get to 3rd floor and below.. so better do it now.
Next gather up all GFs and it is time to level up your characters. Well,
Squall may become a bit too strong for the others.. Sound it is 
considered to level. Stock 300x Cura to provide effective healing. 300x
Berserk, Sleep, Silence, Blind are very useful in the game later. So
do some drawing.. Junction 100x Regen your characters' Mag-J. Due to the
constraints of the format, I have decided to put additional points else
where..

The layout of the 13th floor is different compared to other floors. 
Now head right where you will find the door being surrounded by beasts 
like Moomba. Enter the door and you will find Squall. Squall will 
recieve back his gunblade and now he's back to action!

Exit from that area. Outside the torture room, you will have another 
talk and so exit from the area. Zell will leave the party for the time 
being. Now Squall will head for the vehicle that's located at the center 
of the Prison Tower. Press the keyboard located at the center with the 
X. Once you reach the ground floor, head for the gate and press the X 
button. Black coloured sand [Coal] will flow onto the ground. Now Squall 
and his party will know that Zell hasn't arrived yet... [Point of 
Advice: don't remove junctions from Zell..] 

Now you will be controlling Zell. Note that Zell will be frequently 
chased after by Guards. So RUN! Make a clockwise run through the right 
contour until.... Once you were blocked by a guard [that's the Mean Guy 
p:)], Squall will come to your rescue. Quistis and Selphie are here too. 
[well, they are curious of Squall's behaviour...] Suddenly, gunfires 
started to attack Squall and his party. Just then, a hero dressed yellow, 
started to fire at them [hey! Where is he all this time?]. Rinoa is also 
here too! Watch a funny sequence when Irvine is being kicked down the 
stairs. [Note that Rinoa's attitude has change for Squall..] After that 
mushy stuff, you'll have to form a new party consisting of Squall and 
Rinoa. Irvine with the other two members will deal with those gunfires. 
I will call these teams... [I will be using this for the final battle
too..]

Squall, Rinoa, additional member as the Alpha Team.
Irvine and the remainding two as the Beta Team.

[Alpha] Head up to the 14th floor [well, Irvine says that the exit is at
the north..] Junction all to Squall and company.. Charge! Once you reach 
the 13th floor, the screen will switches back to Irvine and his party. 

[Beta] Don't bother to do Junction Exchange manually. Head to the Switch
menu and there is a Sub-menu called Junction Exchange.. Just simply click
on Irvine [or any character in Irvine's team] and select Alpha members. 
If you check the junction, Irvine will have Squall's Junction, including
his magic! Have his party going in the other direction, down the stairs!. 
At the 6th floor, there is a Save Point. The screen will fade when you 
have reach the 4th floor.

Again, you will be able to control Squall. Talk to your little friends,
Moomba and they will give you a Rename Card and a Tent. [if you pick the
first option during the torture.] Now head up the stairs located at the 
south of the area. Proceed forward and going up the stairs heading north. 
You will reach the controls room. Exit through the lower right side of 
controls room. There you will have a short conversation and now you will 
have to fight the BOSS of this section!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
==================
-----Strategy-----
==================   
This battle could be pretty tough, as you need a lot of Potions and Cure 
spells in your stock. The Elite Soldier has a high tendency of casting 
Aura on the robots. Deal with the Elite Soldier as he could cast 
Meltdown which lowers your character's Vit to 0!. Draw Slow and use it 
on the Elite Soldier so that he will have less chance of restoring his 
lost HP. Beware of the Micro Missiles attack by the GIM-52A as it does 
about 300+ HP damage to one member. [it does 3/4 of your character's
HP, just like Demi] Use GF Quezacotl and Thunder* on the robots and 
dealt the Soldier with your magic and physical attacks. Use other GFs 
when necessary. I would recommend that you defeat the Soldier first. 
Remember to steal Missile from the BOSS: GIM-52A so that Quistis could 
learn Micro Missile. You can make use of the Reflect spell by casting 
on the BOSSES as any good spells will be reflected on your members. [so
don't use Magic!]

Without GF Siren and Carbuncle.
Well, for this battle, the Carbuncle does not posses that much 
importance [however it is valued for its junctions..] and the Siren is
very, very useful if you have acquired ST-Atk-J which I myself think is
the best Junction ability.. Anyway don't sweat. Try your best. I have
did it without the GFs, so can you!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle, Squall and his party will be at the controls room. 
Well, it is a message from Irvine.. Exit back to open area. Start to 
cross the bridge... and there will be another CGI. Proceed to the 
safety region marked by the green blinking orb or it will be a 
game over..

Now your party will be at the lower ground of the tower. Now the rest
of the members is there too. The females will enter the car on the 
right, while the males will enter the car on the left. Now they will 
move away from the D-District Prison.

Your party will end up at a deserted road. Once you gained control of
Squall, remember to draw some magic from the Draw Point. [Aero] Talk 
to Selphie and you will have a view of missiles being launched away 
from the missile silos from the Galbadia Missile base. Now that evil 
Edea had planned to destroy the Gardens with those deadly missiles. 
The missiles have been launched and its target is Trabia.. Selphie is
definitely be upset. Selphie has a suggestion to Squall that is to 
split the entire members into two groups. So Selphie has decided to
head for the Missile Base, err maybe for revenge..

Now you need to send two groups. One of the groups will be led by Squall,
as they will be heading for Balamb Garden to warn Cid about this. While 
the other group led Selphie, will head for the Missile Base to stop the 
missiles from firing. Organize your party well and off you go! Can't 
make any suggestions? Here is a group of ideal parties:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Alpha                          Beta
   
   0--- Squall Leonhart           0--- Selphie Tilmitt
   0--- Rinoa Heartily            0--- Irvine Kinneas
   0--- Zell Dincht               0--- Quistis Trepe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I suggest that you assign a stronger party for Squall as his mission is
tougher compared Selphie's. 

[Alpha Sequence: Getting back to Balamb.]
Point of Advice: State the best Junction by using Str.. to the other
party as you will not encounter any foes here.. I have tested this. 
Now Squall's party will be arriving at the D-District Prison Station. It 
is a warning region. So sneak.. Past through the military barriers. You 
can past it, try it! Now head left and board the controls and press X! 
It is time for a train ride and train chase for the G-Soldier ^_^; 
Switch back to Beta Team...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Beta: Training at Dingo Deserts, Montesrou Plateau]
Now it is time for decent and faster level up of characters. Normally, I
will try to get Level 30 and above as you can get the high class spells
such as Curaga, Firaga, Thundaga. This will help to make your life 
easier. Also try to get Water Crystal, which allows Quistis to learn Aqua
Breath. It will be better if you have gotten sufficient items like 
Saw Blade (from Behelmel) and Shear Feather (from Thrustaevis). Here is
one little trick that I had found and it works! Head to the grasslands
located on the right of Missile Base. There you will encounter 
Thrustaevis.. There is *very* worthable spell for you to draw! It is
Tornado, which can be draw from Level 30 Thrustaveis! Tornado is an 
ideal junction for strength. For those whom haven't defeat the Brothers
try to make a trip to the Tomb of Unknown King. Stock up Magic such as
Thundaga and Curaga. As for the remainding spells, I will talk about them
later. So keep on training! Since Selphie is in your party, try to find
her hidden Limit Breaks such as "Full-cure", "Wall" and "Rapture". 
Getting "The End" spell at low levels will be very difficult. Here is the
trick and it works for people, who do not like to use Selphie...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy Limit Breaks
1. Have Selphie in critical status [a.k.a. yellow HP].
2. Once it is Selphie's turn press Circle to switch to another member.
   Have that member cast a spell and open the Playstation Lid.
3. The game will freeze and you are free to choose the spell. Spells that
   are her hidden limit breaks are very difficult to find.. Good Luck.
4. Until you gotten the desired spell, select the bottom option. Close
   the Playstation lid and you will see the member cast the spell 
   followed by Selphie's Limit Break!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the screen will switches back to Selphie and her company. Press X to 
exit and save your game. Make your way to the Missile Base that's located 
at the other side of the desert. Note that the Galbadia truck has limited 
fuel! Now enter the base along with the truck. Why? That truck is a 
certified Galbadia vehicle. By doing this, your character will be be
to disguise themselves as Galbadian soldiers. (well, you will find 
uniforms inside the truck, which makes sense..) 

[Beta: Inside the Missile Base. Get to work..]
Now head left and you will be in a small room. There is a Save Point 
here. Now examine the blue torchlight. You will be able to open the 
door upon receiving an ID card from the member [that's the second 
reason...] Enter.

There you will meet a Galbadian Soldier guarding the door, which leads
to the security system. As you enter, you will be given three options.

- Act casual..
- Walk by quietly..
- Try to sneak by..

Pick any one of them, hold X and you will find your party walking in a 
serious manner! Exit from the area. Now you will be at the junction 
where you find the machines unloading the missiles to the silos. 
Proceed and exit from the screen.

In this area you will find:
1. A guard standing in front of a door. In that room you will find 
   missile warheads [dismantled]. There is a hidden Draw Point near
   the warhead that says "03" [Full-life!]
2. A Save Point on the left. Heading south from there leads to the 
   soldiers at the ledge. There you will find a Draw Point at the 
   steam platform. [Blind]
3. A computer on the right. This will allow you to prevent the missiles
   from hitting on Balamb Garden. The title says "Galbadian Republic
   Army Dept." plus a map of Galbadia. You can't access it at the
   moment.

Head to the place where you found the two Galbadian soldiers. Talk to
them. Proceed back to the place where you found the soldier examining
the warhead [you are telling them to go on ahead...] Next return back 
those soldiers and you have a sequence. Selphie will say the words, 
"Okay." [well, it asking you to make a spot check at its circuit
room!]

Head back to the first area where you find the soldier in front of the
security system. Talk to him and enter the room. You will find another
draw point containing Blizzarra. Now Selphie will examine the keyboard. 
And you will have the following options [seems that either options work
as your aim to create havoc.. so create havoc!]

- Ahh just hit whatever 
  --> Just press whatever.!
  --> Bang it hard! [have manual touch ^_^; tap Square repeatedly!]
- Hit a few buttons here and there - professional style..

Now time to get out.. or they will be in deep shit... and you will be
given two options.. Here are two methods.

As you exit, you will meet the two G-Soldiers and will be prompted the
following options.

What the heck! Let's FIGHT! -> "Act as Rogue" method..
Try to talk my way out.. -> "Act as a Wolf" method

"Act as Rogue" Method: Battles... [1ST Option]
Guess what? It is FIGHTING TIME! You will get to fight two G-Soldiers.
[2x Potions, 2 AP] There is possibility to get Blizzarga and Firaga.. 
Stock them. Your characters will be no longer in disguise... Try to 
encounter the SAM08G and get the item Running Fire to all Quistis to 
learn a new Blue Magic, Gatling Gun!

Now head back to the area where you find the keyboard. You will a 
G-soldier calling some of the soldiers to enter the room where the 
warheads were. 

You need to head to the controls room which is on the right [there is 
no guard on duty now..]. There you will meet the Base Leader and Base 
Soldiers. Attack!

___________________________________________________________________/

Now Selphie and her company will be trying to destroy the system. 
Talk to the person on the left area and you will be able to move to 
the room in the next area. In the next area, examine the computers 
and Selphie will set the timer from 10 mins to 40 mins. After you 
have done with the time settings, it's time to evacuate! You will 
have a sequence of the injured Galbadian soldier leaning onto the 
panel. Proceed to the first area, where you have entered the 
building. Selphie wants to RETURN back to the place where you find 
the computer. [as they haven't set up the ERROR Ratio] You will find 
a wounded guard on the ground. Talk to him and you will prompt the
following:

I'm doin' it for my friends! <<
It's for my mission!
I'm doin't it for everyone!

he will give you an ID card. Press X and you will be prompted to enter 
your password ["EDEA", chorological order]. Now choose the "TARGET" menu 
and choose "SET ERROR RATIO". Hold right until you reach the maximum 
status [there will be a bar]. Now choose "DATA UPLOAD" menu and select 
"YES". Exit from the computer and head outside of the Base. Note that 
uploading of data requires time about 30 seconds! EVACUATE...

"Act as a Wolf" Method
Make sure that you have continue your disguise all the way. Eventually,
you will be able to head up to the missiles and you could help the 
Galbadian Soldiers to load the missiles! Tap Square as Selphie and her
pals are helping out to load the missiles. After that, exit from the
area. Next head back to the computer and you will be able to set-up the
ERROR RATIO without using the ID Card!. After that proceed upstairs and
following the steps in the walkthrough [except you don't have to head
back to base to set-up the ERROR RATIO!] --> but you need to head back
and defeat the Base Leader and Base Soldier in order to set the self
explosion.

As you return back to the first area, the ground will shook for a 
while... EXIT. Cross the road and you will a short FMV of the missiles 
being launched. Continue and you find a huge machine and that's the BOSS 
of this section.

Strategy
This BOSS is quite tough for its high Vit and Spr. Make sure you have GF 
monsters such as the Brothers, Quezacotl, Shiva. Have tons of Thundaga 
and use it to punish BOSS. Or make use of the Elem-Atk-J as make the
Thundaga combo.. Your characters can inflict 100% more compared its 
original attack. Plus if you heed my advice.. you have Tornado 
junctioned to the character's strength. The Beam Cannon does a bit of
damage about 700+ to one member. The BOSS has the standby time. Try to
kill it off within that time period. NOTE that time still goes on. 
After finishes off the BOSS, you will battle 2x G-Soldiers an Elite 
Soldier.

Without Siren and Carbuncle.
It is very time consuming without GF Siren.. It is valued for its 
ST-Atk-J, which helps in efficient training. [the Thrustaevis are weak
against Sleep..] The soldiers of course are not an exception
========================================================================

After you've defeated the BOSS, head up right note that the door is 
locked. Walk around and search for an exit. Note that you can't escape..
Examine those missile launchers. Your characters will knelt down as they
can't escape! This followed by an awesome FMV of the base being blown up. 
[Remember to check the screen that the door is locked before heading 
there]

NOTE: If you did NOT turn back to the wounded soldier to the error 
      ratio, you will have an CGI of Balamb Garden being hit by the
      missiles and it's game over. You will not be able to fight the
      BOSS.

You will now be at the entrance of the Balamb Garden. Note that the

Make sure that you have use the Junction Exchange. Now make sure that you
have Blizzarga junctioned to your character's Elem-Atk-J. Also has 
ST-Atk-J such 100x Blind or 100x Sleep to it. If you don't have GF Siren
or Carbuncle, I could only say good luck. 

Now the Garden cadets are fighting the SeeD cadets, what could cause
the dispute between the two. Why? Because the Master NORG is pretty 
upset over this... [Galbadia has reported that the Garden is responsible
for the assassination program and Balamb HQ does not know about this..]

At the Central Gate, note that draw points have been recovered. Next you
will find a Garden Faculty.. Talk to it and you will be given the

           use Doom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was a bit tiring huh? Talk to the female SeeD cadet and she will give

            Earth/Wind/ Blizzard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Head north a bit and you will find two SeeD cadets. Talk to them and you

Well, you may wished to head to the Dormitory and use the Save Point. It

already sold off ^_^; Talk to one of the cadets and you will get a Gysahl

You will find a Garden Faculty, talk to him:

Head for the stage and eventually three SeeD cadets will jump down from 
the stage. Talk to the cadet in the middle and he will give your a X-
Potion. Now for the last area... the Infirmary. At the walkway, you will
see two Garden cadets along with a Garden Faculty are against the SeeD
cadets. Well, perhaps they believe Cid was in there... You will be given
the following options:

Comments:   Quite easy. Cast Aero on it to inflict heavy damage. Junction
            Sleep/Blind to ST-Atk-J works fine...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next you find Dr. Kadowaki and she will lead you to the Infirmary. Talk 
to Kadowaki and you will get an Elixir! Now the fights around Balamb 
Garden has been resolved but you still can't find Xu.. Head for the Lobby.
You will find Xu heading for the elevator. Follow her. At the 2F, head 
north and you will find Xu there, all by herself. There is a short 
sequence where Squall will explain about the incoming missiles. Now head 
back to the elevator and you will be able to head to the 3rd floor for 
the first time. Head north and you will find Cid there. Talk to him and he 
will give Squall a key. To save your game, talk to Cid. Now you need to 
set up the MD system [a protection barrier against missiles]. Head for the
elevator and examine the controls on the right. And a blackout.. You will 
a CGI sequence.

Examine the controls first and then examine the hatch, which is directly 
under Squall's feet and climb down. As you are going down the ladder, be 
careful as the elevator will start to operate again! Now examine the hatch 
in front of Squall. Now head to the room on the left and examine the huge 
tap. Now you will be asked to tap Square repeatedly for 10 seconds. If you
have failed, don't worry as your party members will approach to help 
Squall. After you have succeeded, climb down the ladder situated in the 
upper region. In the next area, travels down the stairs. You will find a 
Draw Point [Full-life] near the pillar. Next head upwards and you will 
have a sequence as your members are not sure where to go. The following
options will then appear:

We have no choice, let's go
I'll go and check it out <--
Someone else go check it out.

You will be able to control Squall, attempt to climb the ladder [Press X]. 
Up to a certain point, Squall will force the ladder to reach the control 
room that's at the north. Now examine the controls on the right. The 
ground will eventually shake. It's time to go down.. Examine the ladder, 
choose the option that says "Climb down again" OBSERVE carefully, you find 
a door with a blinking green orb. Examine it and you will be able to climb 
down the ladder. In the next area, you find a handle near the Save Point. 
Have Squall pushed the handle and the metal gate will eventually open. Now 
save your game, it's BOSS time as you cross the bridge.

Squall's Level: 33

Description: This creature lives underground. Its slimy body is full of
             oil. Attacks by splitting oil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy

These guys are quite offensive in their attacks. They do about 200+ 
HP damage with their Oil against one ally. The sucking technique also 
packs a punch. The Blast deals a heavy amount of damage to one character 
[about 200 HP damage]. Oil sometimes causes Slow status on the infected 
character. The BOSSES are weak against Fire. Junctioned 100x Fira/Firaga 
to Elem-Atk-J will lead the BOSS to its death... Summon GF Ifrit to 
finish it out. Make sure of the Cure* which can draw from the BOSS. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now enter the area, and down the ladder. This followed by another CGI
sequence.. The missiles are approaching.. Now head left and you will be 
in front of a gigantic pillar, now head up to the controls, examining 
the right side (there is a key there) and examine the control. You will 
have a short sequence. Suddenly the ground shakes, and electricity 
started to surround the pillar. The pillar raises, causing Squall 
and his company to reach the 3rd floor where the Headmaster's office is. 
Next you will have another awesome CGI..

Talk to Cid and choose any option when given. Exit from the area. Now 
take the elevator and go to the door on the north of the classroom. You 
will then received another CGI feast!.. there is a special CGI if Rinoa
is in your party...

Exit and head back to the elevator. Xu will come to tell you that
headmaster is looking for you. Well, what's the problem? Yeah it was
that they did not how to stop Balamb Garden! Now press the controls and 
you will have another CGI feast!

Squall will now be resting at his bed. If Rinoa is in your party, she 
will come and wake up Squall, saying that she want to visit Balamb 
Garden's Cafeteria. If Zell is in your party, you will find him waiting 
for his order. Just head for the lobby. A Garden Faculty will come to 
you and tell you to head for the basement [it's URGENT!]. Head for the
elevator, check your junctions too. As you walk down the stairs, you 
will be joined by your party members. There, you will see Cid being 
pushed by a rude Garden Faculty. Cid will leave and head back the 
elevator [he seems upset..]. Now head left. Next the ground shakes 
and a sequence with a huge monster [NORG...] revealed from that huge 
"egg". Hmm.. why is the master of Balamb Garden, not a human? He was
pretty upset as the assassination program is not being permitted from
Balamb Garden [which means the Galbadia Garden side has acted on their
own..] and this put Balamb Garden into hot soup. Edea now wants to 
destroy the Gardens...

You will have a short event of conversation and will eventually have to 
fight NORG. (Well, Squall has offended him.. ^_^;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
About the Orbs,
This battle is rather tough if you did not have the complete set of GFs. 
The Side Orbs can does a lot of mischief to your party. They will change 
from Blue --> Yellow --> Red. Once they reached the Red stage, they 
will cast powerful spells such as Blizzara. You change them back to 
blue, by attacking them. Strong attacks will cause the orbs to change 
back to blue directly. Siren works well on the three orbs. Note that it
is impossible to destroy the orbs.
 
Before you could fight NORG, you must destroy NORG's Pod. Once you have 
destroyed that, you will be able to draw Leviathan from NORG [it will
be taking a long time if you have forgot to draw it..]. NORG is pretty 
weak against Wind elemental. Use GF monsters to inflict more damage. [
as they are on area-based attacks.] GF Siren does damage to all parts 
of the BOSS. There is a risky way of reflect the BOSS' magic. Make use 
of GF Carbuncle to reflect those pesky spells back onto the BOSS. Note 
once you are in the Reflect status, you can't use magic to heal 
yourselves as the magic will bounce onto the BOSS too. Make full use of 
Potions, Hi-Potions and Phoenix Downs to restore lost HP. Use Limit 
Breaks when needed. Note that you can't reflect advance spells such as 
Aero from the two side orbs. Refer to the Magic Section for more details 
[that's found in Part II]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the threat has been removed... After the battle, check the "egg" and
you will find a hidden draw point [Bio] from it. Head back to the 
elevator and head for the Dormitory to save your game. 

Next head for the Infirmary and talk to Dr. Kadowaki and choose the 2nd 
option. Now talk to Cid and you will given brief information with five 
options below: 

Cid's Words...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option                    | What it tells about...                     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to make a report   | Squall's report on his mission..           |
The real meaning of SeeD  | For those whom "lie" during the torture... |
About Sorceress Edea      | A dark secret.. Edea is Cid's wife!        |
About Master NORG         | How Balamb Garden is established and where |
                          | is NORG from...                            |
About what to do next.    | hmm...                                     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Others before heading for Lobby.
If you head for the Training Center, you will find a man selling items 
there at the wooden planks. His appearance is also random, just like 
the people in Balamb.

________________________________________________________________________

After done with your "visit", head for the Lobby and you will meet Xu. 
She will tell you that a ship has docked at Balamb Garden. So head up to 
second floor and head to the door with a blinking red light. Now you 
will find a huge ship docked near Garden. Next you will have a sequence 
and they are actually the White SeeD, but they also known as the 
Sorceress' SeeDs. They have no intention to fight Squall and his 
company. Next Cid will come in and have a short talk. Exit and you will 
have another sequence with your friends on the walkway. Now head for the 
Library. Enter the studying area, where you find the desks. There you 
will meet the girl whom you have previously saved at the Training Center 
[it was that young lady whom have peeped into the Infirmary at the 
beginning of the game. BTW, her name was Ellone!]. Now you will have 
another short sequence between the two. [it was about Laguna's 
appearance in Squall's dreams..] Next Ellone will exit and Squall is 
being left alone in the library. (he can't accept the fact*) Now Ellone 
will now leave along with White SeeD, followed by a short CGI...

Now Squall will be back at the Dormitory, lying on his bed thinking... 
There you will find a little boy standing outside a building under the 
huge downpour. (who is he? Give a hint.. the person has the same hair
colour as the present character.) If Rinoa is in your party, she will 
come to Squall and pick any option. Now exit the Dormitory. Now you will 
hear Cid's speech through the announcement system. Then the screen will 
start switching back to Cid, who has trouble in the controls. (well, 
they haven't learn on how to operate the controls ^_^;)

*The Fact (Spoilers!)
Appearance of Laguna in Squall's dream is actually Ellone's doing...

Balamb Garden is heading towards a city, leading to a crash... This is
shown in a CGI..

[Alpha]
Now Squall will be at the bridge along with Cid Kramer. Cid will tell
Squall to head for the Mayor's Residence and tell him that they mean
no harm and apologise for the damage. It is time for challenge cards as
you can get one of strongest card, Seifer Card. If you forget to
challenge Cid now, it will be very tough in the next meeting. Now exit 
from the controls room, and you will be re-joined by your party members. 
Now head for the elevator. Alight at the 2nd floor. Head for the door 
that has been enclosed with red light. Exit. 

You will find that Balamb Garden actually got stuck in between the 
ledges of the city. There will be a sequence with a villager. Now head 
right, talking to everyone that you have met along your way. As you 
reach the area before you meet the guy at the elevator. Notice that
there is a ladder. Press X and hold down.. Squall could actually use
the ladder. Head left from the screen (of course, you need to undergo
a series of stairs..) Next you will find the man in the CGI. Actually 
he is also known the Master Fisherman. Talk to him and you will be 
given the following options:

I'm sorry.. It's our fault --> Occult Fan III!
... What are you talking about?

As you approach the corner of the stairs you will view another short 
CGI of the city. Exit from this area. Now head to the extreme right 
corner and talk to the guy near the elevator and pick the 1st Option 
to enter FH (Fisherman's Horizons). To get back to the upper section, 
talk to the man in light blue shirt. (actually this is a company..) Now 
head down and you will find a windmill being surrounded by water. Right 
from this area is a Save Point and a Draw Point [Regen]. Head back to 
the windmill. Head up to the second floor of the windmill and you will 
have another sequence with the Mayor Dobe and his wife, Flo. Examine 
the lower-right corner (like gears-type stuff.), you will find a hidden 
Draw Point [Ultima!]. Now exit from the windmill. If you head right and
you will find Martine [former headmaster of Galbadia Garden] fishing..
The area seems a bit spacious. Hmm... wondering what it is means?

Walk up the path and noticed that the background music has changed. You 
will have another sequence with your party, exit and note that the 
background music has changed. Next you will meet Flo and after a while, 
Dobe. Dobe is pretty upset.... and hurries to the right. Flo will 
request Squall to help him..

Now head right and down the track to the city. Head up the path and you 
will find a dismantled train track. In the middle of the compound, you 
will find Dobe being threatened by a Elite Soldier. Hmm.. the Galbadians
are in the search of Ellone... Pick the first option, Squall and his 
party will have a battle with those Galbadian forces. (1x Potion, 
1x Hi-Potion and 4 AP). After the battle, the ground will suddenly shakes 
and you will have to fight a similar BOSS at the enemy's Missile Base.
[actually it is the same vehicle. Selphie and her party are in the Base.

Strategy

The BOSS' attacks may be deadly but it is pretty weak against GFs such
as Quezacotl, Leviathan and Brothers. Just use Thunder* to attack the 
BOSS and this battle could be an easy one. Heal your party when 
necessary. Do not use Bio on the BOSS. You can get Adamantine by using 
Diablos' Mug on it! Make full use the "Boost" support as the GFs can
do more damage. Leviathan will be a better choice as you could pump up
to 140! If GF Siren or Brothers have attained level 30+, you can 
easily pump up to 150+... It is better if you make use of Thunder*
Elem-Atk-J combo as it not only increase your attacking power but also
conserve Thunder*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that loud thud, you will meet Selphie and her party members. Now 
you will have a short conversation. Everyone will leave later, and 
leaving only Rinoa and Squall. Talk to Rinoa and you will have the 
following options:

It's because I felt responsible
I was really glad to see them
It did not mean anything.

After the talk, Rinoa will leave. Now it's time to navigate the city.
You will find a damaged train station north from the compound. You will 
also find a Draw Point [Haste]. There is another hidden Timber Maniacs 
at the house on the left of this screen. There is a Moomba statue too 
in that house. [The man's nickname is also known as Grease Monkey..]

On the right of the street that you first enter the city, you will 
find a wooden plank, head right and you will find a Junk Shop where 
you remodel your weapons and there's a Draw Point next to the owner. 
[Shell]

Now you will find a boy on the boat. He is Master Fisherman's student.
And here is the list of prompts... Pick the option where you see the
arrow.

Sort of.. <--
Not really...

I saw him <--
I did not see him

I was sort.. impressed <--
He's just an old geezer 

Next you will have learn some fishing... Ugh.. the Junk shop actually
got choked in the sequence ^_^; Now the Fisherkid will tell you to 
meet the Master Fisherman... Before heading there, head back to the
Grease Monkey's House and you will have a sequence down there.. A
Elite Soldier is there and demands the technicians of FH to fix the 
Iron Clad [well, I guess that you should know what is this..]. Exit
from the House and re-enter. Well, the Elite Soldier has ran off..
In express his thanks, the man then gives you a Mega Phoenix!

Okay back to Master Fisherman.. Now exit and head back to the area 
where you will find the elevators. You will meet Irvine along your way 
and he will join you. Now go down the ladder and meet Master Fisherman
and he will told you to meet him in the inn. [In the area where you
find the main street, you will actually find a building on the left. 
You can get pass there..]

Enter the building where you can actually have some fun.. There is a
actually a machine, which tells about what has happened earlier in FH..
Now talk to the owner and you will get the following options:

Get a room
Buy Items
Forget It.

________________________________________________________________________

Since Master Fisherman has booked the room, so you can enter it.. Now
enter the room and you will have a short sequence regarding Dobe and
the origin of FH. Next you will received the following options:

Sorry, got to head back to Garden
Why not...? <--

Next you will be able to uncover the floor for a hidden Timber Maniacs.
Next exit and you will have a short sequence. Master Fisherman will
talk to the boatman and even the sloppy drunkard also respond. Next
head to the area where you find the Fisherkid. Master Fisherman will 
next give you the following options:

I think you are right. <-- He will gives a Spr Up.
What are you talking about

Talk to him again and he will give you another question.

I think so..
No. It's all right <-- He will give a Megalixir!

Now you are finally done with the sub quest, time to head back to Balamb.
Before heading back to Balamb, be sure to pay a visit at the place where
you previously met the Master Fisherman. You will find a draw point 
[Full-life]. Before heading back to Balamb, have a card game with Dobe
and you can get a rare card, Quezacotl!

At Balamb Garden..
Head for the Quad. You will find Selphie there. There will be a short 
sequence between Selphie and Irvine. [the movement of Garden has already
messed up the stage... Irvine had made a suggestion that they can seek
help from FH Technicians.] Now, Squall will be talking to Cid at the 
Controls room, where he will officially received the honour as the 
chief commander for Balamb Garden [well, he hates that..]. Next, the 
screen will transfers to other parts of Garden where you find other 
party members [Cid is giving his speech...]. Now Squall will be back 
his room...

The screen will now switches to the rest of the party members outside
the Windmill of FH city. The party members are organizing a concert
to congratulate Squall for being the commander of Garden. Then you will 
be given eight choices of instruments for the concert. You will proceed 
in this order: Zell, Irvine, Selphie and finally Quistis. Rinoa is not
involved in the concert.. as she has another important mission..

After choosing the instrument/performance, select 1st option to use that 
particular instrument while the 2nd option to change the instrument. 
The list of instruments/performance is listed below. Well, the movement
of Balamb Garden has messed up the scores..

Before setting the band, don't talk to Zell, instead exit the screen. 
Just go to the city area where you find the inn and planks, Irvine will
find out that all people are missing. Proceed to Grease Monkey's house,
and you will still find that stubborn Elite Soldier. Next the Grease
Monkey will ask Irvine to exit house for a moment... enter the house 
and you will be amused.. Grease Monkey has bashed up that Galbadia 
Soldier! Talk to Grease Monkey and he will give Irvine a Phoenix Down.
Next talk to wounded soldier a couple of times and you will get 5x Fast
Ammo, 5x AP Ammo and 5x Pulse Ammo. After done with this, there isn't
much left to do.. Proceed back to the place where the remaining members
and it's time to rock 'n roll!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of Instruments
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Guitar                       5. Violin
2.  Sax                          6. Flute

Here are some songs for you to compose...

Ballet [Rinoa's Theme]
Requires: Sax, Electric Guitar, Piano and Bass Guitar

Folk 
Requires: Guitar, Violin, Flute and Tap. [better conversation..]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not in the mood
I don't know... <--

Now you will be at the area in front of the windmill. Talk to Irvine 
twice and head down the ladder and IT'S CONCERT TIME! Irvine has told
Squall that he has placed a magazine... well, he is trying to woo 
Selphie ^_^;. Walk down the bridge...

Press Square and head left. Next examine the "magazine" and you will 
have a sequence between Squall and Rinoa. (it is about Squall's 
behaviour..) Squall will be pushed down in the process and you will 
another sequence which causes this pair of lovers to quarrel again. (
Rinoa really wants to confront her feelings to Squall..) Now Squall 
will be back on his bed and have the same dream again. 

Now exit from the Dormitory and head for the elevator. Alight at the 
3rd floor. You will find Quistis, Xu and Nida (remember the person whom
graduated along Zell, Squall and Selphie at the graduation party?). You 
will have a short talk about Selphie. Well, Squall intend to give her a
holiday since after her exhausted trip to the Missile Base. Now talk to 
Nida and you will be asked to re-organize your party [the Switch Menu,
Selphie will be temporarily unavailable.] It will switch to the World 
Map and the directions to control the mobile Garden. 

........................................................................
Controls of Balamb Garden
------------------------------------------------------

Here are the controls:

Square:   Moves forward on land/ sea. 
Triangle: Moves backward on land/ sea.
X:        Board/Unboard on land/shore only.
Circle:   Allows you to the bridge. You will be able to move about in 
          Garden by exiting from here. Talk to Nida and select first 
          option. You will be asked to re-organize your party. Next you 
          will be back at the World Map.
R1:       Changes camera view.
Select:   World Map [changes from a spot view, small map, full map]

Note: The Balamb Garden has very low mobility, it can't crosses high
      type land and could only move on shores. By the way, it can't go
      through between cliffs that you have found at Galbadia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Card Quest at Balamb Garden                                   ffviii_022
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: 1x MiniMog's Card, 1x Leviathan's Card, 1x Carbuncle's Card,
       1x Gilgamesh's Card
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will only start to gather cards once I have gotten sufficient cards.
You need to get aleast the Minotaur's, Sacred's, Ifit's and Diablos' 
card. They are very important for the card quest as they are your 
ultimate cards for this quest. You can get more cards such as Odin [if
you decided to head for Centra Ruins first..]. It will be better if you
have completed the previous card pages before for this quest. The fifth
card is optional..

Ultimate Card Strategy!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 2 3    1) Place Sacred's card at spot 3
4 5 6    2) Place Minotaur's card at spot 9
7 8 9    3) Place Ifrit's card at spot 8
         4) Place Diablo's card at spot 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Card Strategy for Plus/Same.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It cannot be counted as a strategy but it works for me. Place your 
weakest card in the center. Upon the computer has finished for its turn,
look out for any applications of Plus/Same. Next, the computer will
normally try to counter with Plus and Same. Look out for it before 
placing down your card. Good strategy if you needed to protect your 
cards while trying to eliminate the Random rule by keep on playing at
Balamb Area.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After getting all the cards [for other pages, note that the Cards page
5 that there is blank as you can't get that card now.. it is a rare 
card...] Try to get as many as possible.. You should have no problem in
covering all cards except for the characters, BOSS [page 6 & 7] and 
GFs. In Balamb, there are a lot of players. So try your luck. After you
have completed page 1 to 5 cards [get at least 3x cards each...], It's 
time to seek a higher challenge.. the Card Group. Note: do all these 
stuff in Balamb Garden, you are not really to challenge the outside 
world.. If you have incurred the random rule from your previous card
games, continue to play at Balamb Garden and it will eventually switch 
to Balamb Garden's rules.

The Card Group is considered as the strongest group of card players
in FF8. All except the Card Master can be found in Balamb Garden. Here 
is the sequence [remember that it is vital to save your game..]:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:  CC Group Jack
Area:  In front of the elevator. Usually walks from Library...
Description
He is a Garden Cadet. He will be the first one to introduce to you 
about the CC Group. He will be the first one to challenge you in a 
card game. Remember the guy that ask you whether you have challenged 
the Card Group?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Jack has been defeated (guess what? You have become one of the 
best card players!), other members will started to show up.. which also
marks the beginning of the 4-Suit Quest. Follow in order..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-Suit: CC Group Knight Club
Area: The area where you find the Dormitory, Parking Lot and Cafeteria
Description:
He is also a Garden cadet. He will says "Draw.." once you have 
approached him. Quite easy as he rarely uses Level 7 Cards. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Suit: CC Group Princess Diamond
Area: The Lobby, where you find the Directory. 
Description:
Two female Garden cadets. They are usually in pairs and chit-chat with
each other. Can only play with them, while they were chit-chatting at 
the Directory. Normally, you will get a lot of Level 7 cards from them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-Suit: CC Group Prince Spade
Area: The 2F alley, the man standing near the elevator. 
Description:
He is the same guy, who have given the 7 cards in Disc 1 if you talk to 
him. (he normally says "so can you finished the game"). Not quite 
strong.. It is quite easy to defeat him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-Suit: CC Group Queen Heart 
Area: Area at the bridge 
Description:
She is actually Xu.. Defeat her in order to get the Carbuncle Card. She
is quite strong in her card tactics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Former Card King: Dr. Kadowaki
Area: Infirmary
Description:
You have seen her so many times in the game.. She is quite strong.. as
she will have at least one Level 7 card in the game. Even with the above
ultimate strategy, I also lost... I believe that you need to defeat her
in order to challenge the present card-master king
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CC Group Leader: Master King 
Area: At the Dormitory after you have defeat all suits and Dr Kadowaki.
      Head to Dormitory and choose to be alone and sleep.. "he" will
      challenge Squall at the middle of the night.
Description:
Believe it or not.. "he" is actually Quistis! She is really strong in
her card tactics. Defeat her in order to get the Gilgamesh Card. You
will be able to challenge her at the bridge after the night incident.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last CC Group Member: CC Group Magician Joker
Area: Training Center, where you find the wooden planks.
Description:
He is actually the "Man in Garden" whom sold items.. You will get a 
Battle Meter Upgrade if you defeat him. You can get the Leviathan Card
from him. The upgrade is actually adding in the GF report...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Other Cards at Balamb Garden.
MiniMog - won from the boy dressed in blue around the Hall.
Quistis - won from Trepe Groupie #2, found her in the classroom at 2F.

Well, that's all. You can head back to the bridge and it's time to 
cruise around the world! Anyway, prepare for much tougher card 
challenges... Now for Zell's Love Quest.
 ______
/ 4.6b \________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zell's Love Quest [until Disc 3]                              ffviii_023
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before heading to the above areas, I recommend you to return back to 
Balamb Garden. Make sure that Zell is in your party so that you can do
this.. Head inside the Library. BTW, I have to repeat some of 
paragraphs, just to remind you as it last until Disc 3... One of the
contributors has even given me a detailed sequence about the game and
also the girl's name. [Shizuka is the name of the ponytail girl's 
friend]

Before going to the Fire Cavern. The girl with pigtail will mention 
something about Library regulations for kids then talks about someone 
she likes.

Before going to Timber, with Zell in party, talk to the girl and Zell 
will talk about his long wait for the book "Goodbye Pupurun". (That 
book was borrowed forever by Raijin! Check out the Study Panel)

Zell will meet up with the girl with pigtail and was asking whether his
book "Good Bye- Pupurun" is ready or not. (Well, he has already been 
waiting for several months already.. in fact, it has been borrowed by 
Raijin forever) Now exit and continue with the other quests first [one 
will do..] I am not sure whether this needed to be done before Balamb 
Garden has turned into a mobile ship or not.. I have did this after I 
have defeat NORG. (which means Zell is in the Alpha Team..)

Now head back and you will find a conceited SeeD passing by the counter
asking whether the girl with pigtail is around. She will told him that
the girl is on leave. [complete all quests before your journey to 
Balamb Town]

Once you have free Balamb Town from Galbadia, remember to head to the
train station where you will find a girl [dressed in school uniform..
talk to her.] 

Before heading for Trabia, for Library once again and you will meet the
friends of girl with pigtail and asking Zell a questionnaire...

What's Zell's favourite colour?
Red on my jacket
Blue on my pants
I'm embarrassed but pink

What's Zell's favourite food?
Beef
Fish
Hot Dogs..

Then you will be asked to leave the area. Before meeting up with 
Galbadia Garden (after Trabia incident) and head back to Balamb Garden.
Head for the area in the Library where you find the Esuna draw point. 
Next you will have a sequence.. Guess what is it? 

At Disc 3, after Squall is being asked to head for Edea's House.. head
back to the Library and girl at the counter will tell Zell that the girl
with pigtail is looking for you. Now head back to Balamb Town and you 
will find the girl that you have meet in train station. Talk to her and
she will tell Zell that she has been here.. Now head to Zell's House
and you will find Zell's mom telling him that the girl with pigtail was
here already on... Now head for the hotel, and pay 100 gil. The next
morning, your party will find Zell missing.. Head downstairs and you 
will find Zell and girl with pigtail. She will hand in the Combat King 
003 to Zell.

DELING: Still as busy as a bee..                              ffviii_024
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Rinoa's Card, Ifrit's Card
Draw:     Thundara - found at isolated path, west from Caraway's 
          mansion.
          Haste - found in the deserted train station.
          Regen - found next to the save point at FH.
Save Pts: Deling- Galbadia Hotel 
          Deling- In front of Caraway's Mansion
          FH- Next to the train on the left from Mayor's residence..
GF:       n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing's new here... But, I would recommend to at least pay a visit to 
Caraway for Rinoa's card [which is quite a powerful card for its double
As on the left and right..] Now head for the mansion and note that you
can access to the sewers from the statue.. Now talk to Caraway and he 
will give you three options. 

Ask about the Sorceress
Ask about Esthar
Ask about Cards

They typically gives you enquires... one is very important, that's about 
Rinoa's card! Caraway will only uses his daughter's card if you lost the 
Ifrit's card to him. So you need to play a "lost" game to him. Select 
the Ifrit's Card [you will be able to do this as you have accumulated 
long hours at Balamb..] and a couple of lousy cards, hopefully the card 
rule, get everything is not available.. That's another reason, why I 
want to get at least 3 cards for each card type. Lost the game, even it 
is one card exchange, he will definitely pick the Ifrit card. Now he 
will tell you, he appreciate that and he will tell you that he will use 
his daughter's card to challenge you. Just focus on the lower ends or 
the higher ends of Rinoa's card. [don't straightaway put down your 
powerful cards, use the lousiest on the board first..] After gotten the 
card, talk to Caraway again and he will tell you that he has lost to a 
fellow officer, Martine [this guy is tough for he owns Level 7 Cards..] 
Just pilot Balamb Garden back to FH and defeat him in a card game. Focus 
on the lower ends of Ifrit's card, where its weakest point are..] That's 
the end of the Deling's card quest. Now head to Dollet.

Area Rules [not quite confirmed..]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balamb Area
Additions: Open
Cities: Balamb Garden, Balamb Town.

Galbadia Area 
Additions: Sudden Death and Plus, add Balamb Rules 
Cities: Deling City, Timber Town, Winhill

Dollet Area
Additions: Plus and Same, add Balamb Rules

FH Area 
Additions: Elemental Rule and Sudden Death, add Balamb Rules

Trabia Area (!!!)
Cities: Trabia Garden, Shumi Village
Additions: Random, Plus/Same, Sudden Death and add Balamb Rules

How to remove those add-ons?
Just simply play 8 games for the area that you wished to play in. I not
sure about this, but it works for me. As you see Trabia is indeed a 
dangerous card playing region. FH and Balamb Area are the best choice..
Seek the chance to improve your cards tactics with Plus and Same as 
they kill if you make use of them. The worst is on here yet.. There 
are areas with a long series of rules..
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternate way in getting Weapon Mon May [after Disc 1]
Head back to the sewers. Go left after you descend down from the ladder, 
and go all the way up until you can't proceed further, then go to the 
right all the way, then all the way down. Then go right. You should be 
back to the first place, but on the other side. To get the Weapon Mon 
May there, open the gate to the left (forgot which one) then go right to 
get it.

Timber: An unexpected journey...                              ffviii_026
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What an unexpected journey! It was really mysterious and I have managed
to figure it out... Head back to Timber [how to get there? Refer to 
your World Map, press Select.] Now head for the area where you find the
cupboard with the savings. Now go down the stairs or if you enter 
through the entrance from Hotel, just head to the train tracks and a 
train will come. A little girl is in trouble. Squall approaches 
the girl and the screen will started to fade white. Now Squall will be
brought to the Timber Hotel. You can get a copy of Timber Maniacs there.
If you examine the train model found near the bed.. there is a secret
message..

Actually, the secrets found in Timber are actually listed down in the
menu found in the Souvenirs Shop. Here is the menu:

Owl's Tears:      Owl's Tear can be gotten but this applies only if you 
                  did not accept the 500 gil that's found in the 
                  cupboard. Check the basin. It restores your HP fully
                  as it works like a Tent.
Map of Timber:    The old lady have draw up a map of Timber [err... it
                  seems that my ASCII art is much better than her's 
                  ^_^;]
Model Trains:     This is actually the train incident that has happened.
Naughty Magazine: The Girl's Next Door...

That's all about Timber. If you haven't gotten the Girl's Next Door, 
make sure to get it at the area found near the counter. BTW, the former
owner of the Hotel is called Aphora... Anyway all members found in 
Timber has their own nicknames such as Forest Fox and Forest Duck (!?)

Winhill:  Still like a quite and peaceful town...             ffviii_027
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Gysahl Greens, 1x Phoenix Pinion, 1x Holy Stone

It's still a peaceful and quiet town.. Just like in the past. Generally,
there are changes made as the winding path has been concreted and the
truck is no longer there. Now before heading the Mansion, head for the
street where you find the caution sign. It's the Chocobo theme!

Getting 1x Phoenix Pinion and 1x Gysahl Greens.
There is small, tiny Chocobo walking from right to left. Just press X to 
kick it... Next you will find a green feather item arises from the top.
Pick it up and it will says Vase Piece [even though that it does not
add up to your item inventory]. Kick it once more and it will drop a
Gysahl Greens followed by the Phoenix Pinion (this one is a bit 
special.. when you pick it up from the ground, it says Phoenix Down, 
but when you check the Item inventory, you will find a Phoenix Pinion!
... and lastly, try it yourself!

Now it is time for another key quest. The Vase Piece Quest.
Just head to the mansion, remember the big building that was formerly
guarded by Galbadia Soldiers? Enter the mansion and walk up the stairs..
Talk to the man wearing a grey suit [he was the owner and wants you to
find him 4x Vase Piece..] You have already found 1 already..

Vase Piece no. 2
At:  In the same building
How: Head for the statue [which is actually a holding pole for armors]
     Examine the statue (can only be done after talking with the owner.]
     Now a crash will occur.. a Chicobo runs out and leaving a Vase 
     Piece. Must have Zell or Irvine in your current party.

Vase Piece no. 3
At:  Raine's Pub
How: Head up to the second floor. Squall generally has some 
     hallucination... Raine is there, examining the cupboard. Actually, 
     this is the new tenant. Talk to her and the cat.. Pay attention to
     this phrase "Smell flower fragrance"
     Now head to the 1st floor, examine the flower [it was in a vase
     found at the lower screen]. Now Squall will again see Raine and 
     the cat will be there. Examine and you will find the 3rd Vase 
     Piece.

Vase Piece no. 4
At:  The Florist's Shop
How: As you walk down, you will noticed that the owner was always at the
     outside of the shop.. Now talk to her while at the shop. Now 
     examine the flower bed (inside the shop, lower right hand corner)
     and you will get the 4th Vase Piece.

Now head back to the mansion and he will give you the Holy Stone as 
your reward. 

Squall is Laguna's Son?
This can be true.. I have several supporting points gained from my 
journey at Disc 3. Here there is also a sequence... Examine the left
desk at the house next to the Pub. The picture is missing.. who could
have taken it? I will talk about more once at the Disc 3 walkthrough.

NOTES:   n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
After finishing the Galbadia Continent (getting bored with the cards?),
it is time to navigate other parts of the world.. Located at the north
continent, Trabia, you will find a structure located at the Winter 
Island. Now enter the building.

Notice the town folks are similar looking to NORG? This actually the 
hometown of the Shumis.. There is a draw point there.. which allows you
to get Ultima. Be sure your eyes are opened wide when you decided to 
draw magic from it as there is no refund!

Head for the elevator and you will ended up underground.. which is 
actually a beautifully generated town. Walk towards the left until you
found a pond. The building found at the northwest is your destination.
For the first time, Squall was amazed by the statue. It was the 
statue of Laguna.

In other people's eyes, Laguna is a hero (well for Squall's case, he 
think Laguna is a funny joker..) Talk to the sculptor and he will give 
you the following option:

OK. <--
We don't have time

Remember to draw Firaga from the draw point found at the back. Now head
back the Elder's House, located a screen right from here. You will find
the Moomba that is blocking the entrance is finally out of your way..
Now you can access to the draw point [Blizzaga]. Now enter the room.

Next you will have a briefing where Squall were told why the statue 
were here. He was also told on where do Moomba's originated from. It 
was actually 17 years ago, Laguna has ended up here and teaches the
Moomba to talk... Next the Elder will tell Squall that they wished to
complete the statue and would like Squall to assist them in completing
the statue. Now head back to the room where you find the sculptor.
He will tell Squall that he needs to find ingredients to make the 
statue and you will be given the following prompt.

Forget it
Alright <--

Next he will ask you to find the stone, which are already described in
the table below. Once you have found the stone, talk to sculptor and 
he will tell you to find the next stone. Here is the list, requires to
run about the village..

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Centra Ruins is found somewhere in the Centra region (Centra 
Crater), south of the world. It's on one of those islands. The structure 
is a bit kind of strange. It's also called the "Blue Heaven"

Enter it and notice that there is a timer, which last about 20 mins. Make
sure you have acquired the Diablos' Enc-None Party Ability (equipped 
under the character's section). The monsters here are pretty tough. 
Watch for Tonberries [remember those tough cookies which can be morphed 
into a Ribbon found in the Northern Crater of FF7?]. Now enter the ruins 
and take the stairs leading right. It's possible to GF Tonberry at Disc
2 but you need to free GF Odin before you could get this GF. So that 
means you must finish this quest within the 20 minute time interval or
your party will be killed by Odin's Zantesuken...

Up the stairs and enter the chamber of the Odin. Next examine the stone
block, it's actually an elevator. Next you have to take the one of the 
two ladders. The right one leads to a Draw Point. [Aero] Take the left 
ladder. Examine the blue orb (let's named it Power Source). Next climb 
down and examine the blue orb on the panel, that's located on the ground, 
it will reveal a series of stairs. Up the stairway, until you reached 
the statue of a monster. Climb up the ladder on the left and examine the 
statue and choose top option to take the Eye Ruby. Now head up the 
stairs, which will lead to the next statue. Climb up the ladder and put 
the eye that you will find a password [the password is random and it 
looks something like this 0-4-8-5-6]. Now remove both eyes and head back 
to the first statue. [There is a hidden draw point found on the right
of the area. Place the eyes on the statue and the torch on the right 
will be lighted and enter your password. Well the numbers are placed in 
a vertical row. Just simply switch the digits using Left or Right of the 
D-Pad and Down to proceed to the next number. If you entered the 
password correctly, it will reveal a secret chamber and you will be able 
to find the Odin. It's time for BOSS fight!

Strategy
This BOSS does NOT attack! Just keep on attacking until he is dead. But
beware of the time limit. Just use GFs and Magic to dish out damage. 
There are a couple of ways of defeat the Odin in three minutes, just 
simply cast Triple and use a powerful spell and you will be able to 
defeat it in no time! Seize the opportunity to stock Triple which is a 
good spell for junctioning. Note that you can't summon the Odin, 
instead it will appears randomly, based on the characters.... However,
if you did not defeat it on time, it will use Zantesuken and blah..
it's game over. 

========================================================================

Well that's all for the Centra Ruins and you will be back here later
at Disc 3. You must get the Odin before you can get the GF Tonberry. 
You can get GF Tonberry at this moment of time unless your characters 
are really that powerful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC INFORMATION...
You can get the remaining GF MiniMog and the Moomba from the Choco
World. To begin the RPG, you must get the Chocobo from the Chocobo 
Forest [where you will be able to name the Chocobo!]. These summons 
cannot be used, unless the Choco World is loaded from the Pocketstation 
(the top command in the Choco World menu must be selectable for them to 
be used)

ENHANCED CHOCOBO ATTACKS?

<>  CHOCO FLARE
When playing the Choco World, level up to Level 50 and you will come to
an event where Boko [the Chocobo that you are playing] save a female
Chocobo. Afterward, it will say "Power Up" in FF8. Whenever you use the
Gyashl Greens, the Chocobo will use Choco Flare instead of Choco Fire

<> CHOCOBO METEOR
First of all you need to do this:
-> You must get to Level 100
-> One of the first events, you'll run into a female Chocobo [the one 
   which you have saved previously] and that Chocobo has been kidnapped
   by a wizard.
-> Run around a lot and after MANY, MANY battles, you will eventually 
   ran into the wizard. Kill the wizard and the female Chocobo will 
   thank you and then leave the screen.
-> Run around a lot more and after many events, you meet up the female
   Chocobo again and Boko will receive a kiss from the female Chocobo
   and "POWER UP"

<> CHOCOBUCKLE
-> Same as the Chocobo Meteor. It is just after that you have gotten
   Chocobo Meteor. It does an outstanding of 5-digit damage! 

GETTING THE MINIMOG SUMMON...
In order to get the MiniMog summon, you must rescue one of the Mogs in 
the Choco World. Once you do this when you load the Choco World data 
back into FF8, you will find a GF icon-based "Mog's Amulet Charm". Use 
this to a GF and the GF will learn the battle command "MiniMog" Use this 
in battle and you will summon the MiniMog and it will use "Mog's Dance" 
(which heals about 1,500 HP to all GFs that are equipped to the 
battling characters.)

GETTING THE MOOMBA SUMMON... 
You need to get an A-class item [Friendship]. For more information, 
contact Steven Bruck (Stevenbruck@bigfoot.com) or Zane Merritt to get 
it.

NOTE: This summon will only works if, when you load the Choco World 
      data into FF8 game and also applies if the MiniMog is in the 
      standby position instead of sleeping.

Balamb Town under Galbadia Occupation                         ffviii_031
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item:     Zell's Card, 4x Str Up, 2x Hi-Potion, 1x Megalixir, 1x Combat
          King 002, Pandemona's Card
Magic:    Thunder - draw point found in the main area.
          Cure - draw point found at the berth.
Save Pts: Zell's House - 2F
          Balamb Hotel
GF:       Pandemona
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters:
G-Soldier: Fire*, Blizzard*, Thunder*, Cure*
Raijin: Thunder*, Thundara*, Shell, Protect
Fujin: Aero*, Cure*, Life, Pandemona
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Xu has mentioned that the Galbadia may be up to something nasty, head 
back to Balamb Town. If you are pretty observant enough, you will find 
that there is a huge red ship similar to the Garden [That's the Galbadia
Garden]. Land the Garden somewhere near the beach/shore. Enter the town.

The town is now being "infested" by Galbadian soldiers. You will find 
them sealing off the entrance of the hotel, the train station, the 
roads of Balamb Town and the Dock. Now talk to the owner of the 
Rent-A-Car Shop and the lady at the entrance and then talk to the 
G-Soldier. Now repeat talking them in that order and you will be allowed 
to enter the town. Zell will come in if he isn't in your party. (due to
Zell is a resident here..) You will be asked to reform the party where 
Zell and Squall are compulsory characters.

Here is something basic requirements:
100x Blind to ST-Atk-J for one character, 100x Silence to ST-Atk-J for 
the other character and 100x Poison to Elem-Atk-J for one character. 
You must at least gotten some important junctions such as the Str-J. (
without any magic junctioned, your characters can do any big..)

Now talk to EVERYONE in the town before talking Zell's family. Next 
head for Zell's house. You will be able to allow to enter his room (
hmm.. why Zell don't allow his team-mates to see his room?) Zell's room 
is quite nicely decorated. He has a great collections of rifles which 
will cause a final sequence if Irvine is in your party. His Air-board is 
next the Save Point. Now you have a nap. Before leaving his room, you 
can punched his punching bag, pressing the X button. Now head for the 
dinning room [on the right]. Now you will be able to meet Zell's Mom and
other family (Big Bad Rascal and his mother]. Note that this is the best
opportunity to get Zell's card from Ma Dincht. Talk to Ma Dincht, Big 
Bad Rascal's mother... Big Bad Rascal wants to help out the girl that is
living next door. Well, her parents are outside and she is worried about
them. Big Bad Rascal wants to help her... and exit the room. You need to 
find him. Firstly, head for the house next to Zell house and you will 
find Big Bad Rascal there. Next talk to the girl and Big Bad Rascal will
exit. Now head to the Gas Station and you find the Big Bad Rascal is 
hiding behind the tree next the vehicle, which seal off the entrance. He 
was waiting for the opportunity, so that he could contact the girl's
parents. Wait here for the boy's signal and talk to the guard SLOWLY, 
until you see the boy has talked to the owner... Now head back and you 
will find him at the street outside his house and you will be given the
following options (he will doing the talking while you escape..)

Wanna to leave town?
Yeah
Nah

Before talking to the boy, you will find Zell's mother in the hall. 
Well, she was saying that the mother of Big Bad Rascal is a bit worried.. 
don't believe it? Check the dining room.

Do this and returned back to the town and choose the second option. Now
for the guards at the Hotel and they will asked you where is the 
captain? You need to search for the captain. Next talk to the guards at
the Train Station. Now head to the Dock and they will tell you that 
someone has caught a Balamb Fish (well, it is Balamb's speciality...).
Next head to Ma Dincht and she will tell your party that a man has come
in and use their stove (who is this man?...) Now head for the Hotel and
you will be able to see the following prompts:

Where the heck is he? <--
We found him

You will be able to use to the dog to look for the "Captain". Head for
the dock and talk to the dog.. The dog will followed the trace of the
smell (you have been the kitchen, right!?). Now follow the dog to the 
train station and the dog will enter the train, followed by a load 
crash! Raijin was there.. sleeping in the train and he was been chased 
by the dog.. ^_^; Now give a chase to Raijin and head to the Hotel. 
There you will have a sequence... So Raijin is the "Captain" and 
therefore the "Commander" is... generally of course Fujin! Of course, 
you will have to fight Raijin and those two guards..

Squall's Level: 41

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This battle could be an easy one if you know how to make use of the
drawn spells from the soldier. Kill one of Galbadian first. Now draw
Fira and use it on Raijin. Use all GFs except for Quezacoatl. Draw
Thundara and use it on the Galbadian solider. Beware of Raijin's Special
as it could does about 1000+, irregardless of levels. Cast Protect to 
reduce damage. As I have already mentioned early on.. You can defeat him
with 100x Blind ST-Atk-J Combo. But his "Raijin Special" has a low miss
rate. Prepare your party with a couple of Life spells before the battle.

========================================================================

Next the battle music changes and your characters will head inside the
hotel. You will meet Fujin and Zell is a bit over reactive demands Fujin 
to remove the troops from Balamb. She will be re-joined by Raijin and
the bad news is that you have to fight both them. [This is continuous!]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This battle is going to be a tough one. Concentrates your attacks on
Raijin first. This is due to his extreme high-attacking Limit Break 
which does about 1,000+ HP damage. Fujin could also does about 300+ 
damage with Zan. To defeat Raijin, use Aero* which can be drawn from 
Fujin. On the other hand, draw Thundara from Raijin and use it on 
Fujin. This is apparently making them killing each other. Use all GFs 
except for Quezacotl, due Raijin's Elem-Def-J against Thundaga. Next
remember to draw Pandemona from Fujin, or it's is going to be lost 
forever... [until disc 4...]. Make full use of Meltdown to reduce their
defences. Leviathan and Brothers is a great option for this battle. (for
you boost up to 160...)

========================================================================

After the battle, you will have a sequence with both Fujin and Raijin.
They are retreating, actually what they are doing is for Seifer...
In the end, they will leave and you will be back at the control room of 
Balamb Garden. Selphie will return from her vacation. Now you will be 
back at the World Map. Save your game. Now you need to head for Trabia 
Garden on the continent is northeast of Balamb Area. [View from the 
huge World Map and place the cursor and head for the place where it says
"Trabia Garden"

Before making a trip there, do some part of Zell's love quest.. Also
return back to Balamb Town and head for the train station, there you 
will find a girl sitting at the stairs.. Talk to her. Now head to the
entrance of Balamb Hotel. Talk to the guy with the purple velvet. You
can get Pandemona's card from a card game with him.

Now you need to head for Trabia Garden, which is located on the north-
east continent of the World Map. It is marked by a dot on the full 
view of the World Map, somewhere in the snowy regions of Trabia. Brr..
it's freezing cold..

Some Interesting Add-On...

After Squall talked to the hotel guard about the captain, "Where the 
heck is he?", the guard mentions about the cars in the harbour. I talk 
to the new assistant and he mentions going through the back way. I go 
behind the car and finds a guy named Tabloid Guy. He asks for Gil and in 
return he'll give you some info about the captain's whereabouts. 
Here's the list.
Bronze (5,000 Gil) - "This is the place where the captain USED to 
nap. The reason why he no longer sleeps here is because the commander 
nearly ran him over when she went out looking for the car. So I don't
think you'll find him here. It'd suck to be run over while you're 
asleep." (Some info...)
Silver (15,000 Gil) - He tells about Big Bad Rascal's way to get out 
of town.
Gold (30,000 Gil) - He tells that the captain is inside the train. He 
used to sleep there and sometimes got carried to Timber. You can get 
in if you talk to the guards there for several times. (Haven't tested 
it out.)

NOTE:    This section involves a lot of story spoilers. It will be 
         better if you don't refer to this section.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you have reached Trabia Garden, you will find Selphie heading 
towards the damaged wall. She seems rather emotional about Trabia [well,
she was graduated from here... ] She was very upset as they were not in
time to stop the missiles found attacking Trabia. Now follow Selphie's
suit, climbing up the green net, pressing X button. Now you will be 
rejoined by your party. If Selphie is in your party, she will leave 
your party temporarily. Now head up and you will find Selphie talking to 
her friend. Talk to her and you will have the following prompt:

(Not really)
(Just play along with it..)

Next to the Gargoyle is the draw point [Thundaga]. Near the low right-
hand corner of the Gargoyle, you will find 1x Weapon Mon Aug. Now head 
right from here.. You will ended up at the cemetery. There you can 
uncover a hidden draw point [Zombie]. If you check the area carefully, 
you will find a copy of Timber Maniacs! Now head to the left side of 
Gargoyle. There is a mad fellow whom keeps on saying about GF Tonberry 
(well, is that a hint? ^_^;) Now head right. You will find the damaged 
classroom.. There is a Save Point here. Now there is a boy that says 
that there is a treasure found somewhere at near the Gargoyle and you
need to take five steps.. (well, we have gotten that ^_^;). Now head to
the right side and there you will meet two Trabia cadets, Lank and Port.
They are trying to fix the computer. Hmm.. just meddle with the computer
and tap Triangle as your password.. Well, you will get a screen that 
states a profile of a Trabia cadet, Selphie! Selphie will come here and
close it off... it is confidential right?

Now head back to the area where you found that mad man. Now Selphie will
be surrounded by two kids.. Talk to the kids and they will leave. 
Selphie will next tell Squall that they will assemble at the basketball
court.. (if you head back to cemetery, there is a special sequence 
there..). Left from here is the Quad area, where there are cadets 
talking about the recent basketball tournament.. Walk up the stage and
examine the missile, it will uncover any draw point, Aura! Now head 
left again and you will find everyone at the basketball court. Now talk 
to everyone and attempt to exit and you will find a basketball rolling 
down... it is Selphie. Next you will a short event of their pleasant 
childhoods....except for Rinoa. They are actually.....

Now you should be control a ghostly adult Squall. Head back left and
you will meet young Squall. Talk to him and that kid will disappear! 
Head up and enter the house on the north and turn right [now you will
back on the house where Irvine is talking to those young kids]. Now
head up and you will be in the backyard of the house. Next talk Young
Squall again and head for the beach.... Now there will be an event 
where everyone thinking of their pleasant childhood memories. They are
having a campfire at the beach [did you noticed that you can't find 
young Squall, he's a loner, same as young Cloud of FF7]. Then the 
screen will start to switch from the beach back to the house. Irvine 
will be talking to the young form and young Seifer will enter the 
building. Now control the form of ghostly Squall talk to all kids [they 
will disappear one by one] and exit through the door on the right. Now 
you back at the beach with the adult forms of your party. Firstly talk 
to Irvine and Quistis will move. Talk to Quistis and finally talk to
Selphie and all of you will be back at the house again and a strange
lady started to walk past and in their words... "The Matron".

Now you will transported back to your present and there will be another 
conversation between the group at the basketball court. They believe 
that it was their frequently usage of GFs which results this... and 
what's worst, that the Sorceress that they are facing is actually... 

Now it's snowing. Next everyone will exit, leaving both Squall and 
Rinoa. Talk to Rinoa and the screen will fades and you will be asked to 
form a new party. Now you will be at the World Map inside Garden. Now 
you are search for the Galbadia Garden [that giant red ship that has 
previously docked outside Balamb Town.]

The Galbadian Ship is located on a forest at the island on the south. 
There is a lighthouse and a building on left [Edea's House]. If you 
head south from Trabia Garden, you will find that extremely long bridge 
in the middle of the ocean, which makes it impossible for you to do so. 
So head northwest and you find the ship on a forest [Centra- Lenown
Plains]. As you found it, make contact with it.

There you will be at the controls room with Squall and Nida. Then you
will have a short event. Then Squall will view the Galbadian Ship with
his scope in the CGI. Then you will be given nine options. 

No orders/End
My feelings on this
The Garden Cause
Prepare for the attack
Prepare for our defense
Call my comrades
What to do with the hotdogs
Take care of the junior classmates.

Pick the 1st one and you will be able to control Squall and he will give
a string of commands. Now take the elevator down and you will meet up 
with the rest of the party except for Zell and Rinoa. Then you will be 
asked to reform a new party. Talk to Quistis and you need to head for 
the Quad, [first floor, the west-wing] and you will have a short 
CGI feast.

Note that you will be landed on the 2nd floor, instead heading up, 
return to the elevator and head for the Quad. The Quad has been 
infested with both Garden and SeeD members. Head for the area where
you previously find the stage. You will meet Zell giving instructions
to Garden Cadets. Talk to Zell and Squall will handle his ring to Zell
as requested.. (Rinoa wants Squall's ring..). Next Rinoa and the rest 
will enter the screen. Talk to Rinoa and you will be back at the 
controls room. And you will have an awesome CGI:

Now the screen will switch to Zell and his party [Use Junction Exchange
for effective management, it is found under the switch menu]. Head left 
from the area where you found the stage. Then you will have an CGI:

Now head for the Lobby and hopefully that the current party that consist
of Zell and the other members are strong enough to survive for a couple
of battles. On your way you will find a Save Point near the entrance of 
the Infirmary. Entrances to other areas of Balamb Garden are being 
sealed off. You will meet Squall and his party on the way from the 
elevator. Next head for the Central Gate and you will have an event and 
asked to reform your party comprises of Squall and....

1. Selphie and Quistis
2. Quistis and Irvine
3. Irvine and Selphie 

Now head for the classroom and you will have another CGI feast!

A battle against 4x Paratroopers. These soldiers could be rather tough 
as they could cast very damaging spells such as Demi and Silence. They 
have Water, remember to draw from them if required..

After the battle, look for the lady along with two kids at the right of 
middle row of the classroom. Talk to the lady and they will leave to
safety. Next head back to the Controls room...

At the Controls room, you will meet up with Dr. Kadowaki and there will
be an event showing the rest of your party at the places except for
Rinoa and Squall. Now controlling as Squall, head for the 2nd floor. 
You will meet a girl near the elevator. Now talk to her as she say that
one of junior cadets is missing and head for the walkway along the 
classroom area. Head for the door enclosed with red light and you will 
find the boy there. After the boy went off, Squall will be immediately 
ambushed by a Paratrooper in a launch pad, who will charge against 
Squall, the moment he started to move. Squall generally will have to 
take a couple of hits.. and you will be given the following prompts:

Runaway
Threaten the enemy
Look for other option <--

If you choose the other two, you will be ended by hit like a pancake..

Ask the girl down there for help
Press the button for the emergency exit <--
Runaway 
Threaten the enemy

Before choosing the 2nd option, read the below first:

SUB-GAME:
Your aim is to defeat the paratrooper. You are already begin forced to
take a couple of shots.. So you need to conserve most of Squall's 
health bar, which is indicated at the lower right hand corner. The moment
you choose option no. 2, the sub-game will begin..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       D-Pad    : Moves Squall towards and backwards
==================     X        : Causes Squall to punch the guard          
-----CONTROLS-----     Triangle : Causes Squall to kick the guard
==================     Square   : Causes Squall to block the guard's 
                                  attacks.
                       Circle   : Causes Squall to execute the 
                                  Deathblow attack.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             ================STRATEGY==================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is a straightforward one... Once Squall is being pushed
out through that emergency exit, you will find Squall's life bar on 
the south left hand corner and the opponent's life bar at the right
hand corner. Just simply use punches and kicks. Defend will reduce the
damage. Just kick the guard when he is defending. The battle will take
part in mid-air and it's a difficult one. If you are defeated, pick
the first option and you will be back talking at the boy. There is 
something new. If Squall has defend for a long time, you will see
a box that tells you to press Circle to execute the Deathblow. If you 
does that Squall will unleash a punch does massive damage..

For those whom have failed.. you will received the following prompt:
Try again
Try again with HP +200
Game over
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After defeating the guard, you will have a CGI where Squall rescues
Rinoa...

Head left and you will have another sequence at the entrance of the
landed Galbadia Garden. It's actually the same Garden where you have met 
Irvine. Before entering the Garden, examine the tree in the north and it 
will reveal a hidden Draw Point! [Aura] Now enter the Garden. BTW, Rinoa
will return the ring back to Squall and you will be able name it [
default: Griever.]. This will eventually appears...

Inside Galbadia Garden
The layout is rather confusing and it infested with numerous doors and
walkways. You will be re-joined by your fellow members and be asked to
re-organize your party. Note the Save Point found here and this is the
assembly area as prevent you from getting lost.. Most of doors are 
being sealed with codes and you need keycards to access them, which can
gotten from Galbadia cadets. So your aim to look out for them..

Getting Keycard #1
Take the path leading towards right. Next you will be in a walkway with 
3 doors and only one of them is opened [on the right, which is the 
staircase]. Walk up the stairs and you will find Fujin and Raijin there 
on each side of the stairs [don't worry, there is no fight..]. Talk to 
them and took the path towards left. Now entered the room on the right. 
You will find a Garden Cadet, talk to him and get the KeyCard #1. Now 
head for the area where the assembly area is.

Getting Keycard #2
From assembly area, take the left path. Enter the door on the left. It 
leads to the hockey field. Cross the field [you will encounter Slappers 
in that area, which is good opportunity to level low-level characters]. 
There is a Draw Point [Protect] under the goal post (it's the one that 
you can't get it previously.] Next you will find another Draw Point 
from the locker room on the left.[Life] 

Now head for the door on the right. You will be now at the walkway with 
three paths, head right and you find a guy in the lecture hall. Talk to 
him and you will get Keycard #2. Now return to the assembly area.

Now head back the path leading right and up the stairs where you find
both Raijin and Fujin. Up the next floor and you will find a door.
Now you will be able to excess through the door. Enter it and you will 
reach at the Athletic Ground. Next jump onto the field, examine the 
gate facing south. You will find another Draw Point here. [Shell] Now 
head left. Inside the building again and this time, towards south.. 

You have been here before.. Ignore the stairs for the time being and 
head south to the main hall. You will find the Cerberus at the spot 
where hidden Draw Point [Haste] lies. Before fighting him, contour 
around him instead and use the Save Point behind it ^_^; Now make 
contact with it and it's time for the BOSS fight!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
The BOSS has very damaging attacks. It has very powerful spells such as 
Quake [about 600+ HP damage to all allies] and Thundaga [600+ to one 
ally]. Use magic such as Firaga and Blizzaga, which can be drawn from 
the enemies [Jelleye is a good example] in the area where you find the 
ship. GF is a must and make sure none of your members has HP below 
1,000+. Summon GFs except for Quezacotl and Pandemona. The tail whip
can does a massive 400+ HP to all ally. So take note of it. Junction
100x Blind to ST-Atk-J, so that it would not be that deadly. Once on
Triple, the Cerberus tactics will start to change and started to use 
magic such as Quake and Thundaga. To inflict, junctioned 100x Thundaga
and 100x Quake to your character's Elem-Def-J. Overall, it is still 
quite an easy foe..

Some interesting speech:
Party member: "Is this a GF!?"
              "Ahh... Let's just take it."
Cerberus:     ".... PRETTY CONFIDENT."
              "LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO."

(after you done about 5000+ damage)

Cerberus:     "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT"

(upon it's defeat..)

Cerberus:     "NOT BAD... MORTALS."

========================================================================
Now head west from the hall and enter the door on the left side of the 
walkway. There you will find a girl. Talk to her and she will give 
Squall the Keycard #3. Now returned back to the main Hall. Head to the 
Stairs, which lead to the second floor. I guess you should be quite
familiar with the former settings.... 

On the 2nd Floor, head west and you find the elevator, board it and
you will be led to the floor where Squall will meet Seifer and Edea. 
There is a Save Point here [save your game before heading there...] Next 
approaches Seifer and you will have a sequence. After that long talk, 
prepare for another BOSS fight against Seifer. Well for this time, it 
is not a solo-duel.. This time, it's 3 versus 1!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
Seifer finally has made a great improvement. He is much tougher and
stronger, but still has a weak point.... You can draw Haste from him
and use it having more commands and more chances of summoning of GF 
monsters. There is a tendency of him using his Limit Break, only on 
Squall, the Demon Slice [which does about 1000+ HP damage]. So make 
sure other characters has a couple of Life Magic and Phoenix Downs in 
their inventory. Cast Aura and make full use of Squall's Limit Break 
and use it on Seifer. Make use of 100x Bio Elem-Atk-J combo.

========================================================================

After Seifer has been defeated, Edea stands up and left the area with
her disappearing technique.. Now use the Save Point and SAVE your game!
Next head for the elevator and head for the second floor...

Now head for the hall, which is located on the right side, which you 
have to walk around it. Actually, you could have another Save Point if
you have equipped Move-Find ability to one of the character's ability. 
Now head for the Auditorium and Edea will appear from the top! Seifer 
will come in later and prepared for a tough fight... Make sure that you
have at least one character with the draw command.

Strategy

Fighting Seifer
This battle is quite tough. First of all, you can only fight against
Seifer. He is pretty weak, plus his HP has been depleted. Next draw
some Haste, store a few of them. After defeating Seifer with your GFs 
and attacks, make sure 100x Firaga, 100x Thundaga to Elem-Def-J. Make 
use 100x Blind ST-Atk-J Combo.

Rants of Seifer:
"I'm the Sorceress Knight!"
"You will never get pass me."

Upon defeat..
"I can't afford to lose..."
"Ughhh.."
"Dammm.. I'm disgraced."

Fighting Edea
You will be able to fight Edea. Edea too has improved tremedously. Her
Maelstrom not only does 1500+ HP damage to all members, but also
causes Curse status. Draw Esuna from the BOSS to restore the status,
as it prevents your character from using their Limit Breaks! Take NOTE! 
Have someone with Item as his or her fourth command, Remedy/Echo Screen 
will be very useful to cure the Silence disorder. [it will be better
if you have the Treatment command.] Use GFs on the BOSS. The BOSS has a 
tendency on casting Reflect on herself, use Dispel, to break this off. 
Cast Aura and use your Limit Break to dish out additional damage. [
Squall's Renzoukuken can does a massive damage by now...] Have 
sufficient Life Magic in someone's inventory and a couple of Phoenix 
Downs. For a fast win, draw Demi and use it on the BOSS and it reduces 
her present HP to only 3/4! If you have junctioned Triple to Squall's 
Str through Str-J, you will be able to make the most out of it and the 
battle is an easy one. Don't forget to draw Alexander, or it will be
until Disc 4 that you can recover this GF..

Rants of Edea
"Defeat useless fool"
"Enough play.. SeeD must die!"

Upon defeat..
"A..Ahhh"
========================================================================

Now you will view the scene of Seifer falling on the ground. Rinoa will 
approach Seifer, showing some concern and suddenly fall onto the ground. 
Next Quistis will come in if she isn't in your party. Edea will regain 
her consicious and she is actually the "The Matron" referred by Squall 
and his party [except for Rinoa]. Worst of there is another huge 
question mark, Edea, during all this while, did not know what she has 
been doing all this while... SAVE your game. 

On to Disc 3..

WALKTHROUGH FOR DISC 3
========================================================================
Finally, I have reached Disc 3 and it was really a killer.. I have a few
points to clear. That's the changes between the Japanese version and the
North American version:

- Ward will not be present in the 4th Dream Sequence.. due his work as a
  janitor. [this is my assumption, but if anyone knows how to make Ward
  appear in that sequence, I'll be great appreciated your help!]
- I have forgotten to include Occult Fan IV in the JP FAQ.
- There is a secret area where you can face infinite Elynoles!!!
- More strategies and better. [clear up some of vague strategies, I know
  my Ultima Weapon strategy FAQ.]
- I have also added the Ultimate weapons guide in the walkthrough too.

After the exhausting battle at the Garden, Squall is finally back at the
Dormitory.. he was thinking what could went wrong with Rinoa. So pay a
visit to Rinoa whom was found at the Infirmary. After a while, you will
received a message from Quistis through the announcement center. That
Edea wants to meet Squall... at her house. [remember the building that
you can't previously enter? BTW, you can find a world map draw at 
somewhere near the house [Holy]]

You can now exit through the Central Gate or the bridge to the World 
Map. To get through the Central Gate, you must get Balamb Garden to be 
landed on the shores. If you want it's also high time to get some items
for you get the weapons. Either way, will lead you to the results: 
forming a new party however you can't have Rinoa in your party at this 
moment of time. Save your game.

Now enter the house on the left of that island [it's with the 
lighthouse]. Now you will head up to the building and you will find 
the rest of your party members outside house. The house seems have
been damaged and been abandoned for a long time. Now head up and enter
the house.

You will find an item on the ground [it's the Timber Maniacs]. Next 
enter the room located at the north and draw some magic from the Draw 
Point located there [Curaga]. Now head back and enter the right side 
which will causes you to meet Cid. Now head right and you will meet 
Edea along with her husband....

Try to win Edea's Card from Edea. Getting her is rather tough as the
Centra area has almost all the rules, which range from Same/Plus plus
the rule that almost all card players hates: the Random rule. This 
may take a lot of time.. Be patient. If random rule occurred, try to
place your lousiest cards, followed by the strongest card. [if you
lost a rare card, you should know what to do right?]

SPOILERS!!! Skip this part if you want to:
A Sorceress named Ultemicia from the future always wants the power of all
the Sorceresses. In order to do this, she will try to compress time [
i.e. allowing people in the past, the present and the future to live in 
the same time] Ellone has the ability to teleport them to the past. 
Edea tries to refuse it... as the result, she was forced in the 
process.. (she would sacrifice herself in order to prevent leaking where
Ellone is.. and she thinks that was the method. Instead she has assigned
the Sorceress SeeDs.... to look after Ellone.)

Just simply talk to Edea about 4 times (well, the scoop is about that
along..). Now attempt to exit and you will be called back by Edea and 
your party. [Squall seems a bit upset...] Next you will be back to the 
bridge of Balamb Garden, 3F.

Before heading to the Infirmary, take a visit to the Training Center.
Remember that there is a pile of construction materials in the main 
area? Just search that area [strange huh? In the Japanese version, there
is no construction materials..] and you will find 1x Weapon Mon Jul!

After regaining control of Squall, have two members in mind.. I guess
Zell or Quistis will be a good option. [remember that the Magic will be
brought along with them to the "Dream World" Next head for the 
Infirmary... Squall will gets an headache and will be transported back 
to the "Dream World" once again.

* Ward is available in this sequence! You need to avoid getting the
  Timber Maniacs that tells you about the visit to Trabia Canyon. That 
  Timber Maniacs is found at Shumi Village.

Before that you will have a party change like who is representing
whom in the past. Squall, of course is going to represent as Laguna and
have another character to represent as Kiros. Strangely huh? They have 
left out Ward for this sequence. [but Ward is available in the Japanese
version...]

As you see, Laguna has come out of Winhill to travel to Esthar.... 
Generally, he will need cash for his expenses.. Now the problem is that
he is broke! Now he and his company have to act in order to earn for 
their travelling expenses..

Now Laguna will enter the stage dressed as the shining knight armed with
a gunblade.... Now Laguna head forward towards the princess and the 
director after some conversation, a gigantic red dragon [Ruby Dragon] 
appears and head down the slopes. Laguna thought that the dragon is 
Kiros and (Ward) [how stupid.... Kiros and (Ward) isn't that big!] in 
disguise but he is mistaken, it is a real Ruby Dragon! Now you have 
another sub-game, a sword fighting game! 

MINI-GAME : Laguna's a dragon-slayer !
------------------------------------------------------------------------

==================           Square :   Defend
-----Controls-----           X      :   Attack
==================

Objective: Knock down the Ruby Dragon's Life Bar to zero.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is the Life Bars?
Laguna's Life Bar will be shown at the low-left corner
Ruby dragon's Life Bar is at the low-right corner
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================= S T R A T E G Y ==============================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to the last sub game you have at Balamb Garden, you will be
forced to take some damage. Laguna is not fighting the Dragon with his
machine gun but a gunblade. This sub-game is pretty simple. Just
simply return fire after the Dragon has attacked. As the Dragon attack
Laguna, hold Square and Laguna will defend thus receiving no damage.
It's just a piece of cake ! Well if you are defeated, choose the 1st
option to resume the game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have completed the mini-game, Laguna will head down but he 
was trapped ! Luckily, Kiros came to his rescue and throws the weapon
to Laguna, then you will have two options. The first one will FIGHT the 
Ruby Dragon instantly, but note that Kiros and Ward were not equipped 
with GFs, so take note. Anyway, the options are:

Not yet!!! 
   I done for it...
   RUN!!! <--- You need to junction GFs for Kiros and (Ward)

Next you will need to head left. In the first screen, you will 
find a Save Point, so head up and until you reach the top of the cliff. 
Now head back down, note that you will encounter random battles and 
fight the sub-boss, he's a bit although.

Ruby Dragon                                      | Level 28 HP:   18,468
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Oops! Forget to jot it down!
Attacks:     Bite, Claw Swipe, Breath.
Facts:       Weak vs. Cold/Holy, Absorbs Wind and Fire-based attacks
Draw:        Fire*, {Aero -> Flare}, {Demi -> Meteor}, {Reflect}
AP gained:   14 AP
Win:         1x Inferno Fang
Mug:         2x Inferno Fang
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This guy is much tougher compared to the T-Rexaur. It has pretty high-
damaging attacks about 500+ HP damage. Next what you draw from the
BOSS cannot be use to fight AGAINST him. Use Shiva [hopefully you have
acquired the Boost Command] and Alexander to dish out damage. Use other
GFs too except for Pandemona and Ifrit. Use Cerberus for fast casting of 
spells. The BOSS has a Breath, which does damage to both members. Make 
use of Diablos' Dark Messenger, which will dish out approximately 3000+
damage. The quantity of items varies the strength stats. Make use of
Elem-Atk-J to Blizzarga to inflict more damage! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After defeating the BOSS, Laguna and Kiros will be watching over the
evening sun at top of Trabia Canyon, then the screen will fade... Next 
you will be back with a sequence of Laguna talking Edea in the 
orphanage.. It is about Ellone? Next you will be back to Squall and his 
party. Now heal both Squall and the other member to full health and 
note that you need to head for the White SeeD ship [hopefully your 
memory isn't that bad..] which Ellone is on board. SAVE your game. I 
guess you should be able to finish Zell's Love Quest by now... Head to 
Balamb Town with Zell in party.

At Balamb Town, you will find the girl [she was the one at the train
station]. Talk to her and she will told Zell that the girl has visit 
his house. Head to his house and you will find Ma Dincht saying the 
ponytail girl has visited Zell, unfortunately he was not around. Head
to the Hotel and choose to rest at the Hotel. The next morning, Squall
and other member will find Zell missing. Go down the stairs and you 
will find Zell talking to ponytail girl and she will hand Zell 
something useful, Combat King 003 that allows Zell to learn a useful
Limit Break. Now head to Edea's House or get the necessary ingredients
for your weapon remodelling.

White SeeD Ship - Trip to Legendary Esthar                    ffviii_036
========================================================================
Items:   1x Sorceress Letter, 1x Shiva Card, 1x Rename Card
Magic:   Holy - draw point found in the cabin
GF:      n/a
Save:    n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing Laguna's 4th Dream Sequence, it's time to pay Edea
another visit. Now she will reveal to Squall about the White SeeD ship. 
She will also gives Squall and recommendation letter. [Sorceress' 
Letter] 

Locating the White SeeD Ship -------------------------------------------
Well, this was one of most frustrating sequences in FFVIII [but it does
not seem to bother me even in my 1st try...]. Your objective is look for
the ship where Ellone has left with in Disc 2. In the Centra area, you 
will find two C-Shaped islands right? It's found in the deepness point
of the C-Shaped Island... If you can't find it, it's on the other side.
This required some sense. The Galbadian Army are in search of Ellone
and the White SeeD Ship. They must seek a good hiding area right?

TIP: Make use of camera rotation button, R1 button.

ASCII Art [well, it's pretty lousy, so hopefully you won't blame it.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ______              | Well, the * is the White SeeD Ship. I
         /  ___ \             | have only focus on the 2 c-shaped 
         \ \   \ \            | islands and the island where you find
          \_\   \_\           | the white SeeD Ship is actually the 
         __   _               | c-shaped island that's northeast from
        / / _//               | Edea's Island. On the right you will
       / /*/ /                | a larger c-shaped island and that's
       \____/                 | where you find the Centra Ruins. I 
                              | think it is also west from Centra Ruins.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just head northeast a bit and you will be able to locate the ship. 
It is somewhere in Centra Region. You will find the ship docked at one
of C-shaped Islands. Make contact with the ship and you will find your 
characters will be boarding onto the ship. It's white in colour and 
smaller in size compared to Balamb Garden. 

As you entered the ship, you will meet 3 Sorceress SeeDs. At the haul
of the ship, you will find a female SeeD girl and 2 kids. They seems a 
bit unfriendly huh? Now head for the back cabin. There you will meet 
two familiar faces, that's punky guy [Zone] and the guy wearing a cap 
[Watts]. There is a stairs located on the northwest of the screen, which
leads to controls of the ship. There you will find the Timber Maniacs [
it's a gold icon..] and you will meet Zone. If you have the Girl Next 
Door, you can have it exchanged according to the following rates:

Option 1: 1x Shiva Card and 1x Rename Card
Option 2: Sold to Zone for 13,500 gil.
Option 3: Do Nothing

Next head for the cabin. The door that is not blocked by Watts [BTW,
if you haven't gotten Angelo's card, challenge him a card game to get
it.] There is a Draw Point [Holy] here in this area. Next talk to the 
guy and a sad music in the background. Now you will have a sequence 
about Ellone return to the safety arms of Esthar. After the sequence,
Squall is determine to seek to Esthar in order to search for a cure 
for Rinoa.. Next you will be back at the bridge of Balamb Garden. If
you wished, you could take a look at the complete set of Timber 
Maniacs. For those whom haven't gotten the Girl Next Door, you can
now head to Timber Maniacs Building and get it [for location, refer
to Part I] and return back to the white SeeD Ship. [well, it is 
located there.] 

Head for the Dormitory and save your game. Head to the Galbadian
Area - Great Plains of Galbadia [desert area] and fight the Wendigos
and get 6x Steel Pipes [through the Mug Command.]. If you want to 
save trouble...

Next head for the Infirmary where you will find Rinoa. Squall will now
be taking Rinoa across the railway track that connects the continent of
Galbadia and Esthar.. In my own opinion, the music played here, other
than the Eyes on Me, is the best music. It's lovely right? After 
walking for a while, Squall was on his thoughts again [reveal a secret
regarding his coldness behaviour..] Examine Rinoa and Squall will carry
her on his back and moving towards Seaside Station, which lies in front
of the Great Salt Lake.

You will meet Quistis and Zell at Seaside Station. Guess who is coming? 
It's Edea! Irvine and Selphie will be coming towards you. Now you will 
have to reform your party with Edea is in your party [she is not 
compulsory character]. Now you will be back at the World Map on the 
south-eastern continent of the map. SAVE your game. BTW, the battles
are getting tougher, don't hesitate to do some levelling up. In the 
middle of the conversation, Zell will ask whether he remembers the name
"Dr Odine"?

Yeah, I remember
I can't remember... tell me more.
Whatever

Typically pick any option you like. Now you will be back at the World
Map. You will find a giant white colored lake [Great Salt Lake], make
contact with it. BTW, Edea is a great magic user!

At the Great Salt Lake, Selphie will go and check out the things first..
Next you will be asked to set a new party with Edea [again she is not a 
compulsory character.] Next head up through that snowy path, with 
Squall carrying Rinoa. (this beats me... wonder do Squall get tired?] 
Now you should be at the screen with a huge skeleton of a dinosaur...
Instead of walking forward, climb up the skeleton on the right. Just
simply walk up, as there is no need to press X. Next you will be at the
screen with the dinosaur's bone forming as a bridge. Examine the south
area for hidden Draw Point. [Meteor] Next cross up that "bridge". Next 
you will be at the edge of the cliff and there is another Draw Point. 
[Thundaga]. Next go to the edge and press X to jump down. Now the rest 
of your members will follow the suit, head up to the next area. You 
will be on the edge of a wide cliff. Make a right turn. There is a Save 
Point in the area. Head left twice and you will see a gigantic monster 
jumping from below, it's another BOSS fight. 

Squall's Level: 60.

Description: A monster born of ancient bones deep in Great Salt Lake. It
             is assumed that it come to life after the Great Salt Lake
             dried up.
Attacks:     (Claw grab), (Claw swipe), Confuse, Blind, (Stand Up),

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
This BOSS looks very scary and it has very powerful attacks, which does 
roughly about 800+ damage, bringing characters with low HP to instant 
death. Draw Curaga and use it on the BOSS and it will be dead meat! 
Your attacks are puny useless and are pretty weak. Use this method if 
you have not acquired Leviathan's Recover. The BOSS will turn into 
stone before it's death.

If you have acquired Leviathan's Recover command, you can defeat the
BOSS with just two hits as one will do 9999 HP damage to the BOSS. It
will be dead meat in no time. If you want to seize the opportunity to
stock up spells, cast Regen on the BOSS and it will remove HP, just 
like Poison for the BOSS. Do not use the 100x Drain to ST-Atk-J combo,
it will do harm than helping you. The claw swipe occasionally causes 
Curse (prevent your characters from using Limit Breaks.] BTW, as the
BOSS stands up, it start to use Status magic such as Blind, Dispel and
Confuse. As for those who want to try to seize a Power Wrist and stock
up Flare, I would recommend that you have all characters guarded against
Confuse. As for ST-Atk-J, junction 100x Blind to it, so that the attack
does not do harm. 

========================================================================

After the BOSS fight, head right and you will hear something sound
associated with electricity. [there will be a hidden Save Point if you
use Siren's Move-Find ability] Now face north and examine it. Then it 
will release a electric force field. Then it will release a hidden
ladder, next press X and Up and you will be in a new area.

Now head northeast, don't worry there is no random battles here. Next
examine the panel on the left and you have the following options:

Try to operating it <--
There is no time for this

And you will have the following prompt.

Display Test
Colour Check
Camouflage
Random <-- don't miss this one!
Exit Test

This actually concern with the gate that you have just gone through..
wow! The Esthar indeed have some great technology.. Have some fun with
it.

Take the path and you will end up at a door. Enter the door. Next you 
will enter the elevator [PS: it has no walls!]. Talk to your members. 
Then head up and the elevator will shake. Now Squall will put down 
Rinoa on the ground and there is a short conversation with your party. 
Next a hexagon-shaped door will be revealed in the north direction. 
Enter it and you will have an CGI.. the legendary Esthar City was
revealed!

Then you will see Squall and his party start to collapse [not again!] 
and you will be shown the screen to see who is replacing whom in 
Laguna's 5th Dream Sequence.

at the entrance of the cabin which Kiros and Ward has entered. Next 
talk to the cute Moomba and next talk to man at the panel. Return and

powers and now they are searching for a suitable candidate] Next, one 
of the assistants will come up. [actually, not the people, even Adel's
loyal assistant, Dr Odine is also not please with the rule. Now draw 
some magic from the Draw Point [Death] and save your game. Now return 
to the building. There, you can find the Weapon Mon 1st Issue at 
the south-left corner [it's on the floor]. Next head back to the 
elevator. Approaches Professor Odine and you will have another battle 
against those guys. (2x Esthar Soldiers (cyborg), 1x Elastoid)

we begin?. Elevators are very important, as walking for such long

Cheryl's Shop: CLOSED for the Time Being. I guess it could be the 
               my mistake for reading the shop title carefully. In fact
               one of the shop has the Centra Shop logo, which means
               adding this shop, there are 5 Item Shops!

========================================================================

Now head for the Tears' Point, which is located at the southeast of 
the World Map from the city. Make sure you have acquired the Mug 
ability from the Diablos. If not try to gain some levels. SAVE your 
game. BTW, it is safer to drive a car! [Note that you can't get into 
any random battles through driving a car.] (make sure you have enough
Fuel, which will automatically be used..)

Now exit the city and head to the outskirts of the city. Next head 
southeast of the continent of the World Map. It's called the Tears' 
Point. Next examine the Draw Point [Life] along the path and head up. 
Now in front of the statue, examine the Draw Point [Reflect] and pick 
up the Solomon's Ring. Next you need to steal Malboro Tentacles with 
the Diablos' Mug ability. After you reach the requirements shown in 
the table below, you will be able to summon the Doomtrain by using the 
Solomon's Ring.

Getting Doomtrain ------------------------------------------------------
_______________________________________________________________________
|                                   | QUANTITY |   Name of ITEM        |
|                                   |__________|_______________________|
|===================================|   1x     | Solomon's Ring        |
|REQUIREMENTS FOR GF DOOMTRAIN      |   6x     | Remedy +              |
|===================================|   6x     | Steel Pipe            |
|                                   |   6x     | Malboro Tentacles     |
|___________________________________|__________|_______________________|

Before you can get Doomtrain, make sure you have the following 
abilities:
GF Alexander 
- ST-Def-J x4 [you can refine Quistis' Card to get this]
- Med Data (you must get this in order to have Med LV Up) 
- Med LV Up. (you must get this in order to convert 60x Remedy to 6x 
  Remedy +

GF Siren
- Treatment (no perquisite.. so you can easily find it.) Better to
  have this.

GF Diablos
- Mug (no perquisite, but 200 AP will be taking quite a long time..)

Magic
- 100x Confuse -> Draw from high-levels Behelmel [Galbadia-Montersou 
  Plateau)
- 100x Sleep -> Draw from Fungaur [Dollet- Hasberry Plains (forest)], 
  Gayla [Trabia - Bika Snowfields, Trabia Crater]
- 100x Berserk -> Draw from Wendigo [Great Plains of Galbadia, 
  deserts outside Deling City]
- 100x Silence -> for those whom does not have the Treatment Command
  and must have a lot of Remedy and Esuna [draw from Grand Mantis at
  the forest of Lenown Plains outside Edea's House] Silence can stored
  from Grat at Balamb Garden Training Center

* Don't include any ST-Def-J for the remaining characters, especially
  Sleep! Junction the above all to one member. Have the spells 
  mentioned above to one character. Sleep, Berserk, Confuse and 
  Silence (if necessary)

To Defeat Malboro
- including all above.
- 300x Blizzaga -> you can get this from Snow Lions [Trabia - Bika 
  Snowfields], Jelleye [Centra - Lenown Plains]
- Elem-Atk-J [Ifrit has already had it.. But it will be advisable to
  get two more. Quezacotl and Shiva has also have it.]
- 100x Curaga [draw from Mesmerize]
- Degenerator [Quistis Blue Magic from Black Hole]
- Recover [GF Leviathan]

At the battle:
Once you encounter a Malboro, you will find yourself in deep shit.
The Malboro will cast Bad Breath on all members. All members except
for the member whom was protect with all the protection will be under
a haywire series of pain (which includes all status ailments, except
for Petrify and Doom). Now has that character use the Treatment [
Esuna/Remedy for those without Treatment] command on himself/herself
Next cast Treatment on other members. Next mug the Malboros. If the
Malboro use the Eerie Sound Wave or Dissolving Acid, cast Curaga on
that character [BTW, summon Cerberus beforehand, to make life 
easier.] or if you have Recover, will be much better. Selphie can
do her part as the best support character. Just Mug and hold L2 and 
R2 to escape. For those whom want to defeat the Malboro, just attack
and draw-cast Demi from the Malboro [summon GF Diablos could be a 
waste of time..]. After sometime, the Malboro will start to use Bad
Breath once again. For how to junction, refer to Basic Tutorial at
Section 1.0

1x Solomon's Ring:      It is stated above in the walkthrough.
6x Steel Pipe:          You can get it by using Mug Command on  
                        Wendigo [green gorillas with yellow spots,
                        found at the deserts of the Great Plains of
                        Galbadia]. You can also refine Elastoid's 
                        Card for a 1:1 ratio.
6x Malboro Tentacles:   For those whom have problems in getting 
                        this, you can refer to my Monsters FAQ.
                        Refer to the paragraph under "At the battle"
6x Remedy +:            For this case, you need to get at least 60
                        Remedy [which can be brought from the shop.]
                        Next use Alexander's Med LV Up to convert
                        them to Remedy+ in a 6:1 ratio manner.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you have all the requirements huh? Just use that item from the 
Item Menu just like for Diablos and you will summon the Doomtrain!
The Doomtrain can be gotten in Disc 4 even if you haven't gotten the
Solomon's Ring during this visit. But if you do not have Alexander,
I suggest you have get it at Disc 4 [but it will be difficult.]. One
more reminder, Malboros have very low encounter rate and they will
not appear here anymore after your space visit. Head for Lunar Gate.

Next head for Lunar Gate, it is north from Tears' point. The most
distinguished feature is the platform for blasting off rockets. Now head
there and enter it. Next enter the building. At the building, follow 
the lady, you meet someone, not a person... it's Angelo. Next Squall 
will confront Angelo. Next enter the place where you found the space
capsule. Now you will find that the rest of your party will be gathered
at the place. During the conversation, you will have the following 
prompts

(... space? Let me think about it)
(I'll do whatever it takes) <--

Next the instructor will tell that are only sufficient space for 3 
people.. Squall and Rinoa occupied already 2 of them. Edea wants to
stay back as she's afraid that she will go haywire once she was there.
Zell volunteered himself to protect her!

... Not too sure about that
... Thrust Zell (anyway the Matron is powerful enough to take care of 
    herself..) <--

After the preparations are done, you will be asked to select another
member. Choose one member has is required to retained at low-levels.
[want to know why? read on.. Normally, I will choose either Selphie
and Irvine. BTW, they are your "killer" weapons.] Now you will be
given the following prompt:

...Yeah
... Let me think over it.

Now the screen will switch to the people at that controls, and you 
will have an CGI of the capsules blasting into space..

Now the screen switches back to Zell and the rest. You will be able to
control Zell and exit through the door with the green orb. Next you 
need to head back to the Esthar Capital. This followed by another CGI
of the Lunatic Pandora approach the city.. Edea and Zell are compulsory
members. I would recommend you to pick Quistis as the third member.

Now you need to head back to Esthar. You should print out the map..
it's handy. But there's no harm in heading to the Research Center and
draw Death magic from the draw point. Remember to get Solomon's Ring
or it will be rather late in the game that you will get it..

Head back to the capital and head left twice, crossing the street with
the red pipe that's has been written "LEFT SIDE" and "RIGHT SIDE". Next
head down when you come to the elevator junction. Draw Earth from
the Draw Point and head for the Research center. Talk to the guy at 
the entrance, picking 1st option and enter the building. Now you should
be familiar as you are back to the place where Laguna has come to 
during the 5th Scenario. Next board the elevator and enter the controls
room where you find Dr. Odine. Now talk to Dr. Odine and he will brief 
you about the Lunatic Pandora passing sequence...

The Pandora will pass through the city and launch three attacks. You 
need to stop them. They will come to the following places:

ATTACK SPOT NO. 1:   A Street where you will find the bird eye's view
                     of the city. Time: 15:00 ~ 12:00  [4] on the map.
ATTACK SPOT NO. 2:   The place where you will find the intersection of
                     the streets. Time: 10:00 ~ 05:00 [9] on the map.
ATTACK SPOT NO. 3:   The place where you will find the construction 
                     works. Time: 03:00 ~ 00:00 [12] on the map.

Before heading to the Attack Spot 1, head to look for the lone Esthar
Soldier and he will leave the Combat King 004 after you have finished
talking to him.

These spots are where the place where you will find the Lunatic 
Pandora. So head back to the city. Now you need to head for Attack Spot 
No.1. You will find a time-bar, which will tell you the time. So head 
right until you reach the central gate. Next take the path heading 
north from here, OBSERVE carefully. Now head up and draw Magic from the 
Draw Point [Curaga] located on the platform. Next head left. Press 
Square and you will find the picture of clip under the time bar. Now 
wait there until the time hits 15:00. NOTE: You will encounter random 
battles at the city. Press Square to view clips of the locations, this 
also means that you can't play any card games.

As soon you found the Lunatic Pandora, you fight 1x Elite Soldier and
1x G-Soldier [Mug: Cottage (Elite Soldier), Mug: Phoenix Down (G-
Soldier), kick them out of your way. Now Zell and his party will enter 
the Pandora. Now draw magic from the Draw Point [Meteor] on the right. 
Next head up and you find another Draw Point [Curaga] near the 
elevators. BTW, There are couple of Draw Points found here. So it's
your concern to find them all.

Board the 02 elevator. Now head down and turn left once you reach the 
junction and proceed until you found that you are on the other side of
the walkway. Once exit from that area, keep on heading down until you
reach the 03 elevator. [RED] There is a ledge located at south-east and
climb down the ladder and you will find a Draw Point [Confuse]. On the
tunnel found on the right, you can get a LuvLuv G. Now for those whom
have trigger the red detonator while at Evacuation site at Disc 1, you
should be able to past that... Next you will find 3 trap doors. Check
them and you will find the following treasures.

Door 1: Power Generator
Door 2: Silence Draw Point
Door 3: Phoenix Pinion

Now keep on head left and you will find a lone path. Search that area
and you will get the Combat King 005. If you search the Generator, you
could uncover another Draw Point [Ultima!]. There is nothing much to
do, so back track...

Climb and board 03 elevator. Once reach the ground floor, entered 01 
elevator. Now head left and you will find a Draw Point [Holy] on the 
lower left corner. Now head up and you noticed a hole in that area,
which you can actually enter it... Now enter the area and you will be 
able to get a Spd-J Scroll! Head up (a Save Point if you have 
equipped Siren's Move-Find) and until you find a huge robotic monster
[Mobile Type 8] and approaches it. You will be thrown off from the 
Pandora and this followed by this CGI.

The screen switches back to Zell and followed by a short sequence. The
screen fades and switches to Squall and his party... Remember the crater
that surrounds Centra Ruins, this is something related to the Lunar Cry.

Monsters <this sequence only>
Propagator: Thundaga, Curaga, Esuna, Life
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that awesome CGI, Squall and his party will be released from 
their capsules [do you know that you could "swim"?]. BTW, the screen is 
being tilted. Now talk to the space crew and examine Rinoa, who is 
found behind the guard near the south-left corner. Next Squall will 
carry Rinoa on his back. Now followed everyone to the Medical Room on
left of the walkway, enter the room and you will see Squall placed 
Rinoa inside an oxygen chamber. BTW, The guard is a card player. Now
exit and followed the man dressed in white, Piet. Now you should be on 
the junction where you found a stairs. Head up and enter the controls 
room. Now check the monitor on the right of mains. Next you will have a 
CGI. Now talk to Piet and leave the room. You can have a card game with
him in order to get the Alexander [save before doing so.].

Now head back to the area where you found the stairs. Head up and you 
should be at a tunnel. Talk to the girl and you will have another 
sequence. [there is a sequence of several astronauts fixing the seal 
for the Sorceress Adel. Looks like Jenova in Mount Nibel of FF7..]

There is a pathway that leads to the Astronaut's Locker Room and it is 
in the northeast direction of the tunnel. Now walk down the tunnel. 
You will find Ellone in the next area. There is a hidden Draw Point in 
this area [Meteor]. Next talk to Ellone. Now Ellone will follow Squall 
after the conversation. Time to check on Rinoa. [Don't forgot Laguna's 
Card, which can be obtained from Ellone through the Card Game!]

Next as you were in the tunnel, and the screen will switches to Rinoa, 
who is starting to move. And a warning signal was sent to the controls, 
could it be the machine failure. Next your other party member will 
leave along with Ellone. Now head for the Medical Room. As you was at 
the walkway outside the Infirmary, you will find the guard being knocked 
by a ghostly Rinoa. Press X at Rinoa and Squall will be rejected off 
from her. Head for the controls room, where she is heading. Now at 
the control room, bump to her and she will leave. Check the monitor on 
the right and you will be shown the picture of the rocks. Next you will 
have an CGI of a spaceship approaching the planet. Leave the controls 
room and head upstairs and you will have this CGI:

Enter the Astronaut's Locker room and you will find Rinoa [dressed in 
an astronaut suit head for the airlock.] Now you need to get an 
astronaut suit, examine the cabin [looks like a locker to me..] and 
Squall will change into an astronaut! Head for the air lock, through the 
door on the left in the locker room. You can't get Rinoa back to the 
place... Now head back to the control room and you will have an event of 
Rinoa breaking the seal of Sorceress Adel... Now the ship has trouble as 
it is heading towards the cursed planet. Now talk to everyone and they 
will head for the escape pod. Talk to Ellone and head right from the 
controls. Talk to Ellone, whom was on the elevator and you will find a 
Save Point there. Head right and talk to Ellone. Next examine the 
unoccupied pod and you will view an CGI:

Next Ellone will come out and started to bring Squall to the past..

Rinoa is on a Galbadian Truck with Irvine, a very funny sequence [
remember the incident before they first meet Squall at the D-District
Prison?] and this is followed by the talk with Zell at Balamb Garden. 
She wants Squall's ring and Zell will try to get it for her. Next you 
will have the sequence after you have defeat Edea at the end of Disc 2. 
A mysterious lady had possessed Rinoa.. the Sorceress from the
future and you will have a long event.

Here is the summary of the event:
Rinoa starts to float past through the space. As time passes, Rinoa is
floating closer and closer. Next you will have a couple of CGI of 
Rinoa regaining her consicious after her bangle (Odine Bangle..) floats 
up. She starts to think of Squall and operate her oxygen tank.. actually 
this is through Ellone.

Squall started to exit from his chamber and help Rinoa and head out of 
the escape pod and reaches for Rinoa. Next you will have a mini-game of 
Squall catching Rinoa, which is about 2 minutes to catch Rinoa.. Just 
simply position her in the middle of the screen and press Triangle to 
secure the position. You will be automatically reunited with Rinoa after 
that mini-game.

Now Squall will carry his love and carry her forward in space and 
found a giant air-ship [Ragnarok] shown in a cool CGI. They will then 
enter the ship. Next examine the panel on the left and it will close
the air lock. Now head up and you will have some short conversation. 
Now go through the door and you will find out that the ship has been 
infested with gigantic Aliens. Head down stairs and you will have to
fight eight of them. Below are the general stats of these monsters. 

Squall's Level: 67

/ BOSS \________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Propagator                                     |  Level 42   HP:   5,200
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A monster living in space ship Ragnarok. Very violent in 
             nature. Attacks anything that moves within the ship.
Attacks:     BiteBite, Silence, Blind, Thundaga, (punch down)
Fact:        n/a
Draw:        Thundaga, Curaga, Esuna, Life
AP gained:   5 AP [5 x 8 = 40 AP for all 8]
Mug:         8x Wizard Stone
Win:         Shell Stone, Death Stone, Aura Stone, Holy Stone, Ultima 
             Stone, Flare Stone and Protect Stone.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
These guys may have very damaging attacks, but they are bit quite easy 
to defeat. Your party only comprises of Rinoa and Squall. During the
battle, Rinoa will be able to use her new Limit Break, Angel Wings. Make
full use of Curaga to restore lost HP. Angel Wings pack a punch. Make
sure one of them is at least protected against Silence. You could also
seize the opportunity to stock up spells. GFs works well. So it is 
kind of an easy fight.

========================================================================
You will not encounter any random battles here. Firstly you must defeat 
those propagator with the same colours first. Let's says if you have 
defeated the Purple Propagator in the Hanger, you must fight the other
Purple Propagator at the other side [refer to map]. If you did not, they 
will regenerate and you will fight them all over and again. Certain Draw 
Points will appear after you have defeated them. There are 4 kinds of 
aliens and they are different in colours and there are two of the same 
kind. Refer to the map above for their location.

After defeating all aliens, head for the elevator where you previously 
found the green Propagator and you will have an event. The equipment is
responding... and Squall will reply over the telecom. Now everyone is
treating Rinoa as the Sorceress due to the Lunar Base crash 
incident. This followed by the song "Eyes on Me"...

                   On the stage, on my own
                   Whenever said my words
                   Wishing they would be heard
                   I saw you smiling at me
                   Was it real or just my fantasy
                   You'd always be there in the corner
                   Of this tiny lttle bar

                   My last night here for you

                   My last night here with you?
                   Maybe yes, maybe no
                   I kind of liked it your way
                   How you shyly placed your eyes on me
                   Oh, did you ever know?
                   That I had mine on you
 
                 * Darling, so there you are
                   With that look on your face
                   As if you're never hurt
                   As if you're never down
                   Shall I be the one for you
                   Who pinches you softly but sure
                   If frown is shown then
                   I will know that you are no dreamer
                   
                   So let me come to you
                   Close as I wanted to be 
                   Close enough for me
                   To feel your heart beating fast
                   And stay there as I whisper
                   How I loved your peaceful eyes on me
                   Did you ever know
                   That I had mine on you

                   Darling, so share with me
                   Your love if you have enough
                   Your tears if you're holding back
                   Or pain if that's what it is
                   How can I let you know
                   I'm more than the dress and the voice 
                   Just reach me out then
                   You will know that you're not dreaming

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that wonderful and romantic song, you will be now controlling
Ragnarok and will be landed on the Esthar's desert area. There you will 
be able to meet the people of Esthar including Professor Odine's 
assistant, Aide. Next Rinoa will leave with them [for she has been 
accused of being a Sorceress]. Head back to Ragnarok and enter the 
meeting room [the place where you find the controls, marked "C"] There 
you will find Irvine, and the rest except for Edea and Rinoa. After some 
conversation, you find Selphie and Irvine moving out. Once you 
approaches Quistis, the ground will started to shake, because Ragnarok 
has landed off from the ground! Now head for the controls room and you 
will find Selphie as the pilot! Now you will be back at the World Map. 
Here are the controls of Ragnarok. BTW, there is a Draw Point [Life] at 
the junction where you find the stairs that led to the main hall of 
Ragnarok. Another hidden draw point at the haul, where allows you to nab
Full-Life [once only.]

The Sorceress Memorial Hall - Rescue Rinoa!                   ffviii_042
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    n/a
Magic:    Stop - at the entrance.
Save Pts: n/a
GF:       n/a

Monsters:
Tutrapod - Cure*, Esuna, Life
Torama - Death, Demi, Life
Imp - Silence, Blind, Confuse, Sleep
Behemoths - Tornado, Flare, Regen
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I make some changes [it will be definitely better to get Rinoa 
first before the World Tour..]. The Sorceress Memorial Hall is a 
Y-shaped shape structure. [heck, you could also make use of Ragnarok's
Auto Pilot Feature. Just press SELECT thrice to activate the great 
World Map and point your cursor at Sorceress Memorial Hall, Press X and
confirm Auto Pilot.] Enter the Memorial Hall. Next head up to the stairs 
and there is a Draw Point [Stop] in this area. Talk to the Esthar 
Soldiers at the gate and you will be given the following options:

Force your way in <--
Forget it

Next you find Rinoa, who is being trapped inside a chamber (similar to
Adel's chamber) and the scientists are testing her whether they could 
find ways to seal her Sorceress powers. But Squall refuse that and the
other members will aid Squall.

Proceed towards the area where you find the chamber, examine it. You
will eventually have a sequence and a CGI. Next exit from the area. The
party is now surrounded by a flock of Esthar Soldiers.. But a mysterious
huge man dressed in green asked them to stock. Squall seems to remember
the voice of that person. Now Rinoa wants to visit Edea where you hoped
to get some advice from Edea. You need to head to Edea's House. But I
would recommend you to take the following tour in order to solve the 
mysteries, lying around the world of Final Fantasy VIII. Time to power
up!
 ______

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Great World Tour for Disc 3                               ffviii_wt3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, do you know that it's high time for capturing the remaining GFs
and it is the best time to level up. The battles upcoming would kill you
if your characters are not up to a certain level. Now I will tell you
brief about this world tour and it comprises of the following sections:

5.10a   Lunar Base Crash Area - about the remainding crew of Lunar Base
5.10b   Obel Lake Mystery - allows you to get some great items
5.10c   UFO Sighting Incident - Alien Encounter!
5.10d   Ultimate Weapon Upgrading - how to get the ultimate weapons
5.10c   Cactaur's Island - Getting GF Cactaur
5.10d   Centra Ruins Revisited - Getting GF Tonberry
5.10e   Deep Sea Research Center - Getting GF Bahamut
5.10f   Deep Sea Deposit - Fighting Ultima Weapon

But before I continue.. I would like to mention some critical areas:
1) The Island closest to Hell
2) Island closest to Heaven
3) Choco World Items
4) The fastest way to gain AP.
5) Secret Area to encounter INFINITE Elynoles [Disc 3 only, after Lunar
   Cry]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The Island closest to Hell
This island is located at the most western area of the World Map
 __________________
|                  |  It is located on the western area from Galbadia
|    iiii          |  continent. It is rather a huge island, without
|* i iiiii         |  shores for Balamb Garden to reach it. This is
|    iii           |  typically a great area as it has tons of spells
|                  |  for you to draw [Ultima, Flare, Triple, 
|                  |  Full-Life, Aura, Meteor, Quake] 
|__________________|  Key: *    Island closest to Hell
      Fig 10.0             iii  Galbadia Continent

To draw those spells, use Diablos' Enc-None to walk around the border
to get it and within the area.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) The Island closest to Heaven
This island is situation to the most northeastern area of the World 
Map. You will find it surrounded by the huge Grandid Forest along with
some islands. It has also no shores.
 _____________________
|                   * | It is quite easily to read the map [hopefully]
|             GGGGGGG | Legend:

|                     | 
       Fig 10.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Choco World Items
Ugh... I have been receiving e-mails on where to get rare items such
as Friendship and Mog Amulet. These items can only be gotten through the
Pocketstation. The Pocketstation also allows you to get rare items such
as Dark Matter and Power Generator easily... 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) The fastest way to get AP
You can find another island located at the most south-east area of the
world map. You can also encounter in the Kashkabald Desert [rarely]
                        Legend
|                     | kkk   Esthar- Kashkabald Desert
|           kkkkkkkk  | aaa   Centra Area
|           kkkkkkka  | ci    Cactaur's Island
|       aaaaaaaaaaa ci| 
|     aaaaaaaaaaaa    | Each Cactaur could nab you 20 AP! It has also
|_____________________| a couple of nice spells, Haste.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Secret Area to encounter Infinite Elynoles (Disc 3 only)
Refer to Section 5.6 for the map of inner Esthar. Head to [6]. And you
will find a spooky Esthar Soldier in that area. Just talk to him and
he will say "heheheheh.." and leads to a one-to-one fight against the 
Elynole! [btw, if you encounter somewhere else it always fight you with 
it's back facing the screen.]. Just defeat it and do not steal from it
and you can easily stock up numerous Energy Crystals. After that fight,
exit that screen and return, you will find that man again..

Lunar Base Crash Area                                         ffviii_043
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items: Alexander's Card 
Area: Esthar - Abadan Plains
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have make a couple of research and it is finally confirm where to meet
the Piet and the members of former Lunar Base. It is just situated at 
the Abadon Plains. You need to equip Enc-None and wonder around that
part of the plains. Remember that the southern tip of Esthar Continent?
It is just somewhere marked on the ASCII map below: (BTW, I have 
corrected the ASCII map empteen times and this is my best shot.)
                   
                  |      |     \=======\   
                _  \     \      \======/   ===  search this area!
               | |  \     \_   __\====/         BTW, this area is just
                \_\   \_____\ /======/          south from the Tears
               /           \  /                 Point.
          Minde Island      \/ 
                           Abadon Plains                      

Just search the area and you will have the screen started to fade off..
Next you will find the crashed Lunar Base, along with Piet leaning his
back against the scrap metal and you will also find an attendant too.

Remember that it is not always the same spot.. Just walk around the 
area marked "==" and you will find the Crashed Site. Don't try to 
search the edges of the peninsula, just search inner area. It is 
somewhere in the middle and closest to the tip of Esthar. It does not
matter whether you have gotten the Alexander's Card.

Obel Lake Mystery                                             ffviii_044
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Three Stars, 1x Luck-J Scroll
Magic:    Break - world map location near railway road.
Save Pts: n/a
Monsters: n/a [use Enc-None]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least, I have finally made this section possible. Thanks to a few
contributors for the answers for this mystery. First of all, you need
to locate the lake. It is at Galbadia where you will find shallow waters
[the colour seems a bit lighter.]. Now there is an arc of land that 
edges into the lake. Just press X and you will see the message below:

It's Obel Lake
 Throw a rock
 Try humming <-- (this does not work in Disc 1 and 2)

A black shadow rose to the surface
Throw a rock
Try humming again <--

Black Shadow: "...Hello, humans. What a lovely time."
              "There's something large there...."
Press X again
Black Shadow: "Hello!"
Black Shadow: "Can doe me a favour please?"
              (What is it?) <---
              (I don't want to hear it.)
Black Shadow: "It's my friend, Mr Monkey, can you find him for me?"
Black Shadow: "Mr Monkey should be in a forest somewhere. Keep walking
               around and I'm sure to find him."

Now you need to find Mr. Monkey... Next examine the lake and choose to
"throw a rock" and retreat after you have something like the following
message below..

 .
 .
 .
The rock skipped 3 times

You need to get a phrase that says "The rock skipped many many times." 
You will know why later.. Now head to Dollet and you will find a train 
station near it right. On the extreme left, you will find a forest.
[Dollet- Hasberry Plains] and you will have the following message.

There is a monkey
   Throw a rock <---
   Sing (very funny.. hahahahaha!)

You will ALWAYS miss if you picked a stone that skip between 1 ~ 5 
times.. and you will always get this message..

"Ahh Darn it!" Y-You're just a big loser. I make to skip the rock as
many times as I want! So there! Ha-ha! Loser! Dork! Idiot! Your mom
wear combat boots"

If you use the rock "The rock skipped many many times."... you will 
definitely see this message:

 "... OUCH!
   ... D-Darn it
    ... You're gonna to pay for that!"
The monkey will then threw a rock at you and upon inspecting the rock, 
you will find some carving on it. "URHAEO"

Now report back to Black Shadow.
You need to talk to the Shadow until he has you the corresponding 
phrases:

1st rock >>>
Balamb Area <Rinual Shores>
Phrase: "At the beach in Balamb something special washes a shore all 
        times"
Now head to Balamb Town [don't enter it]. Instead search the shore
way.. There is a special edge-out of sand when the tides are low. Just
check that area and you will find the second rock "STSLRM"

2nd rock >>>
That's the rock that you have obtained from Mr Monkey. Anyway, if you 
can't find him the Shadow will give the following hints:
"If he's not around, perhaps he took a train towards Dollet."
--> that's when you can't find Mr. Monkey...
"Mr. Monkey had a rock like this I think..."
that's the clue for that rock... "URHAEO"

3rd rock >>>
Galbadia Area <Timber- Mandy Beach>
"You'll find something on an island of east of Timber, too."
It's an elevated island where you need enter through Ragnarok. Enter
it through Balamb is possible. But will be very hard... Just search
along the land and you find the rock, "REAIDR"

4th rock >>>
Galbadia Area <Galbadia- Monterosa Plataeu>
"There's also something on top of a mountain with a lake and cavern."
Just followed the trails of the river and it will lead to a waterfall.
Now landed Ragnarok on top of the mountain and search the edge where
you will found the waterfall and you will have the following message:

A bird is warming an egg.
Check it up     <-- 
Leave it alone  

Check the egg out and you will have a fight against 2x Thrustaevis,
they are quite simple {Mug: 8x Shear Feathers, 6 AP} and you will found 
the 4th rock "EASNPD"

 Writings on the man-made rock:

  No.   Rock Location    : Carvings on the rock
  1.  Balamb rock        : S T S L R M
  2.  Mr. Monkey rock    : U R H A E O
  3.  Timber rock        : R E A I D R
  4.  Lake Cavern rock   : E A S N P D

Words Build taken from the 4 Rock: MORDRED PLAINS HAS TREASURE 
Hint: Read from right to left from top to bottom on the carvings.

Okay time to head for the Morded Plains. It is north from the Great 
Plains of Esthar, behind the mountains. You can find the entrance of 
Trabia Canyon [where Laguna's 4th Dream Sequence occurred there...]
Next you need to search it thoroughly and here is a small map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
tt  - Trabia- Vienne Mountains
XX  - Esthar- Morded Plains
*   - Treasure [Three Stars]
ee  - Esthar- Norties Mountains

Clear enough? Actually, the Morded Plains looks more like a hexagon
compared to a star to me. Just simply press X with XXX Area [they 
look a bit more brighter...] and you will have the following message:
[you can't view them on the world map, instead you will find message
boxes instead..]

"There are many multicoloured rocks with faces all over the place.."
Press "X" again then a rock will spoke:    
The blue-faced rock whispers 
"People call us :The Liars Rocks!"  
"I don't know were the treasure is..."

It will also gives some hints..
"Some just talk nonsense." 
"Some just repeat the same thing."
"Some just say opposite of what we say."

Next press X and you have a couple of speeches from other rocks and
they are:

The black-faced rock tell you sternly: 
"The treasure is probably at the direction of the North Star"

The white-faced rock tells you coldly
"The treasure is located at the west." or 
"The treasure is located at the east." or
"The treasure is located at the north." or 
"The treasure is located at the south."

The red-faced rock tells you angrily
"The treasure is to the east." or
"The treasure is to the west." or
"The treasure is to the north." or
"The treasure is to the south." or
"The treasure is not here."

As you could figure out, that the black-faced rock is the one that keep
on telling you the same thing. However if you attempt to follow the 
white-faced rock to north and next it will say to the east, to all sort
of directions!. Therefore the mostly reliable source of information 
comes from the red-faced rock! Just watch for its speech and move a step
towards it's direction each. Ignore all other messages except for the 
red-faced rock. The treasure, which is a Three Star item is found in the
center of the star.. But you must have this message box: " The treasure
is not here.", press X again and you will get the treasure. It takes 
time and patient to solve this mystery. Avoid taking long distances, 
that's a tip that I could give.

There are still two more spots...

Hint #1
"Take sometime off at Eldbeak Peninsula. I bet it's a wonderful place."

[that's located at Trabia, and you will see a small edge out facing 
Dollet if you view the World Map. It is between the vertical distances
between Shumi Village and Balamb Town.]

Eldbeak Peninsula : TRETIMEASUREATMINOFFDEISLE
Break the password up and it will give you the following:
If you take out the words TIME and OFF
TRE - TIME - ASUREATMIN - OFF - DEISLE
You get: TREASURE AT MINDE ISLE. The black-faced rock kept saying the 
treasure was at the north, but instead the blue rock has mentioned that
some of the rocks meant opposite of what they mean. At the lower-left 
area of Esthar, you will find: MINDE ISLAND! [Isle is a common short 
found used for "Island"]. Refer to Fig 10.1. Now head there (required the
Ragnarok] and search the area and you will find another item, Luck-J 
Scroll!

Hint #2:
"Take a break at the railway road." 
I think the treasure could be a draw point. I have just simply follow 
the train track and search it on the other side where I find a draw point 
[Curaga] on West Coast of Esthar. You will also find a man in the 
Seaside Station. That person also uses Level 7 cards!

Thanks to a fellow contributor, he manages to find out the reason (which
is very convincing) but I did made some corrections to suit the
walkthrough.

From Jack Taylor:
" Firstly, I have found the answer to "take a break at the railroad 
bridge"; "I wonder what it means?" This is a little joke on behalf of 
Squaresoft. They mean you to take the words very literally, and sure 
enough, on the Galbadia continent, there is a bridge with both a 
railway and a road going across it (hence railroad). There is a 
little area of land to the right hand side of the bridge, between 
the cliff and the river that can only be accessed with the Ragnarok. 
Land the Ragnarok on this strip of land then walk to the corner 
nearest the bridge, press X button, and there is a draw point with.... 
you guessed it.... "break" spells in it (hence "take a break"). 
This is hardly very valuable, and as far as I know there is nothing 
else there, so it is just Squaresoft wasting our time." 

Hint #4:
Unexpectedly, there was indeed a fourth hint from Mr Shadow..

Well, I think that Jack Taylor really deserves a round of applause for
solving the remainder of secret, which turn out to be another joke...

Mr Shadow always says "take a break at the railroad bridge" and "take 
some time off at Eldbeak Peninsula" Thanks to Jack, he managed to cover
something else...

According to him:
Mr Shadow says "Back in the day, South of here, there used to be a 
small but beautiful village surrounded by deep forests. Everyone lived 
a happy life there". 

And here is his solution for the problem.

"This refers to a spot on the southernmost Centra continent. It is a 
more or less circular clearing surrounded by forest. When you walk up 
to it on the world map and press the X button and it says "nothing here 
but rubble" and if you press X again it says "absolutely nothing".

UFO Sighting Incident                                         ffviii_045
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   5x Elixirs, 1x Aegis Armlet, 1x PuPu's Card
Magic:   n/a
Save Pt: n/a
Occur:   World Map.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now time for some good looking quests, I would recommend you to do this
after getting Tonberry GF as it has ability that allows you to buy 
Elixir [but it will be expensive, so followed the cheat at the end of 
the section.] To make things work it easier, equip Enc-None [GF Diablos'
ability]. You will be able sight UFOs in battles.

UFO Sighting Spots [you don't have to do this sequence in this order]
1. Winhill Bluffs (east from Winhill) (Cow)
2. Mandy Beach [shores] (south-east from Timber). (head of a Statue)
3. Esthar-Kashkabald Desert (north-west from Cactuar Island) (Pyramid)
4. Health Island (east from Trabia Garden) *you needed the Ragnarok
   to accomplished this. (Artifact)
 
How pilot Ragnarok and head to the Great Grandidi Forests [err.. there
is only one huge forest found in Esthar continent.] Just head towards
north from the Chocobo Holy Area which you done in Disc 2. And land
Ragnarok on the hilltop north from it. Wonder around and you will 
encounter the UFO!

UFO?  Stats
HP: 12,100 LV.100   AP: none    
Attack: none        Draw: Demi
Steal: none         Win: Aegis Amulet

It does not attack, just keep on attacking it. Well, the item dropped
seems to be a good one..

*Make sure you have the Item Command

After it fled away with a Big BANG, you can now head towards the area 
where Balamb Garden is formerly located and you will encounter the PuPu, 
(it's the pilot of the UFO and he was ejected before his ship explodes). 
You can choose kill it and receive Accelerator or help him recover by 
giving him (Accelerators are cheap stuff compared to the Hungry Cookpot)
, it keep on saying "Elixir Please" and "More Elixir please" gave it 5x 
Elixirs, which you have brought then you will receive PuPu card.
  
PuPu   Stats
HP: 810  LV. 100   AP: none 
Attack: none        Draw: Firaga, Blizzarga, Thundaga, Curaga
Steal:  none        Help: PuPu Card   Defeat: Accelerator 

Just help and get that PuPu's Card. In my opinion, 5x Elixirs for a 
Hungry Cookpot and a PuPu card into the collection, is definitely
better than an Accelerator. [besides the ability learn is also much 
better]

Ultimate Weapon Upgrading                                     ffviii_046
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This really too maddening! I have virtually received over 200 e-mails 
on weapon upgrading... Is it that hard? It also took me a day to 
understand the system [JP version, I don't know much about Japanese!]
Here you will only find answers to the Ultimate Weapons [final weapons
for each character] and how to get the ingredients.

First of all, I need to start off with the following facts [some of 
them are good news and bad news..]

1. You don't necessary need the Weapon Mon Magazines to get the 
   weapons. I have actually play back an old file [which I have 
   forgotten to get the magazine, Weapon Mon 1st Issue]. As a result,
   I ended training and gotten numerous amounts of ingredients for the
   Lion Heart. As I was about to tune up Irvine's weapon, Exector, 
   which is found Weapon Mon Aug. I found the Lion Heart is 
   upgradeable.. as I have gotten the requirements! So it is not 
   necessary to get them unless you have gotten the requirements.
2. Squall's Lion Heart can't be gotten in Disc 1... Why? In Disc 1,
   you are only limited to travelled within the Galbadia Continent 
   which makes it impossible to get to the ingredient, "Dragon Fang"
   However, it's possible to get it at Disc 2 onwards. I have found 
   another place to encounter Blue Dragons. Plus it applies to almost 
   all other characters. You may need to play card intensively.. by
   getting over 20x Elynole's Card [that's mad..] and converts them 
   through Card-Mod-RF. Still, I would prefer to get the first few
   weapons before that fight begins.
3. Rare Items such as Moon Curtains, Med Kit, Doc's Code can't be 
   gotten from battles, instead you need to undergone a couple of 
   refinement process. This makes me earned for the Accessories to
   come back. This will work much easier if you have gotten a 
   Pocketstation. [unfortunately, I don't own one.]. For those whom have
   read the Monsters FAQ (also found in GameFAQs), you will seen the
   ultimate disaster in getting 1x Holy War..
4. Certain weapons required items are very hard to get... Examples are
   Adamantine, Energy Crystals etc. [the monsters that own them are
   even more tougher. One good example is the Ruby Dragon, which has
   an awesome HP of 89,100 at Level 100] But it's possible to defeat it.

Locations of Junk Shops
-| Balamb Junk Shop - left of the screen of the town centre.
-| Deling Junk Shop - in the Parade road
-| Dollet Junk Shop - found within Noutilus
-| FH Junk Shop     - found on the right of town centre, cross the 
 |                    planks
-| Esthar Junk Shop - it's Don Juan's Shop!
-| Man at Garden    - it's the Card Magician Joker! You will find him
                      at the Training Center (randomly)

OR

You can find make use of "Call Junk Shop" menu ability if you have
gotten GF Doomtrain.

I hopefully you basically know the menu set-up look like. If not, refer
to the diagrams below [this diagram looks identical to the Junk Shop
menu]:

  |               | Strength 45%  -> 48%^             |
  |               | Accuracy 255% -> 255%             |
  |_______________|___________________________________|

Well, time for some explanations. The numbers in the brackets are 
those that you have in your ITEM inventory. If the numbers on the left 
exceed the numbers in the brackets, then you will be unable to perform 
an upgrade. 

In case, my English is a bit too hard to understand...

      _ _ _ _ _ the name of the ingredient
 ____/_____________
| Adamantine       |
| 1           (0)  |
  |             \_ _ _ _ _ available in your item inventory
  |__ requirements

In this above case, you can't perform an upgrade. The weapon [as you
may guess it's the Lion Heart]. Why, you don't have the item produce an
upgrade. (0) is definitely less than 1. It is pretty easy to understand.

If that's not clear, there's nothing I can do...

Note that you can de-graded your weapon back to it's original form, but 
the used materials will be gone forever. If the number 48 is yellow in 
colour, that means there is an increase in attacking power. But if the 
colour of the digits is red, which means that your previous upgraded 
weapon is much better than the weapon you have chosen to upgrade to. 
[For example, Flame Saber is obviously a better weapon compared to the 
Cutting Trigger.]

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE (regarding combat)
You can't get an item from a monster by winning IF you had steal from a 
monster during combat. How to equipped Mug? Refer to Basic Tutorial.

Examples:
1. You fought 2x Adamantoise and you mug one of them [get an item, 
   let's say Whisper for an example.]. You will not get Adamantine 
   even though you have defeat the other one. Adamantine can be ONLY
   obtained if you defeat BOTH Adamantoise and do not mug them!
2. You fought 1x Ruby Dragon and you mug it [get: Inferno Fang] and 
   when you defeat it you get nothing.
3. You fought 1x Ruby Dragon and defeat it. You will mostly get Fury
   Fragment or Inferno Fang [between level 20 ~ 40] or Energy Crystal
   [level 80 and above]

Okay, time for the requirements..

It is somewhere in south-east area on the World Map, located in 
Centra Continent. The place has a green cactaur icon that's moving 
about in the desert [that's is the Cactaur!]. Make contact with it, by
walking approaching it but not using Ragnarok! [it's not like Ruby 
Weapon of FF7] It is a HUGE one, not those tiny cactaurs! If your 
attacking power is not strong enough, it can run away! It is called the
Jumbo Cactaur, about 4 times larger than your characters!

Squall's Level: 97

             Cactaur is one of those.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
Even though this BOSS has extremely high HP, it's still possible to 
defeat it. You need to get the above requirements. And there are a lot 
of strategies to defeat it. Typically, it's no sweat! Just have your
highest attacking character with 100x Water Elem-Atk-J to increase 
damage inflict by half! [I have Squall do 9999 HP damage each time, he
attack with 255 strength stats!]. 

The Ker Plank does average damage to all characters. So it's best if you 
have summon Cerberus to counter to status. Now have this combo chain 
[make use of the Three Stars that you found early on one of the old GFs 
such as Quezacotl]: Triple -> Curaga-All -> Aura -> Limit Break

The 10,000 Needles can does an instant death attack to any character,
regardless of Vit Stats. So be prepared to have some Life spells stocked
or item such as Mega Phoenix [very effective if two characters are dead]
or Phoenix Down. Don't bother to waste Full-Life, just simply do this 
and your character can survived with this combo: Life -> Limit Breaks.
Make sure that at least one character has HP over 2,000 as the Ker Plank
can does another dead attack against all characters. [This makes Rinoa
a valuable party for this counterattack. Her Invisible Moon works like
the Holy War.]

If you don't have the Water-Elemental Attack Combo, this battle could be
quite hard. Just draw and cast Meltdown on it. Don't bother to use Demi/
Diablos as Gravity-based attacks are not working against this BOSS.

TIP: With all moves countered, half of the victory is yours. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now with GF Cactaur, you can get super characters. Typically, I just 
left Irvine in the bay from the moment, I had recruited him. [as a 
result he's more powerful than any other characters, as he has more 
levels to go.] Now try to train him/Rinoa at the Islands closest to 
Hell/Heaven with all those Str Bonus, Mag Bonus and Vit Bonus. Once you
have gotten Bahamut, get HP Bonus added to it.

* Note this can be done in Disc 2
After finished off Cactaur, it's time to head back to Centra Ruins. It's
time, for a series of tough fight and get another GF: Tonberry. This
GF is quite tough.. You cannot also avoid to have that 20 fights even if 
you managed to get 20x Chef Knives. These items just serves as a mark 
that you have fight at least 20x Tonberries. You can obtain Chef's Knife 
by modified the Tonberry King's Card and Tonberry's Card through 
Card-Mod RF. The Chef Knives does not make the count, it is the battles!
 
But before that you need to dealt with the Tonberry. Here is an advise
on what if you are going to fight the 20 times:

1) Keep track of battles, exit the Centra Ruins and save your game at 
   World Map and use a Tent. Make use of the Chef Knife to keep track.
2) You can finished it quicker by using Limit Breaks, but it will be 
   risky

Ways to defeat a Tonberry:
1) Once you get into the battle, do NOT attack with the Attack/Mug 
   Command too often, as there is a probability of the Tonberry using 
   Everyone's Grudge at your character. This also applies to offensive
   magic such as Ultima. It does not use that move to counter damage
   done by GFs. Everyone's Grudge can easily does a 4000 HP damage and
   that random. 
2) Have someone with high compatibility with the Diablos and give that
   person Auto-Haste. Just keep on summoning GF Diablos and you will be 
   able to do approximately 18,000 HP damage in two turns. If it work
   better if you have Doomtrain as Doomtrain lowers it's defense. After
   the Diablos does its job, summon any other GF [preferred Pandemona,
   Alexander or Cactaur to deal the remainding 2000 HP damage.]
3) Don't not let the Tonberry approaches your character. Try to keep a 
   distance apart and keep on damaging it, before it uses Chef's Knife
4) Rapture and Degenerator does not work it, so don't bother to use it.
   It will be pretty easy if Quistis have cast the Mighty Guard and have
   Squall unleashes his Limit Breaks. 2x Renzoukukens followed by a 
   finishing blow will be enough [different case, if you cast Meltdown 
   first, but it has a possibility of being counter, therefore summon
   Doomtrain first]

After the 20th Tonberry has been defeated, you will fight the Tonberry
King and it is the beginning of the BOSS fight!

Strategy
It's getting stronger and tougher each time.. [if you are observant over
the previous battles. This GF could easily kick you out of the way if 
you are not careful enough. GF Diablos and Demi no longer works on this
transformed version. Make use GF Doomtrain to lower its defense and have
Slow status on it. Now be careful of it's following attacks:

It's sharp!: Tonberry King approaches your characters and followed by a 
sharp poke, caused damage corresponding to Vit stats. (it may be random)
Junk: The Tonberry King call a series of Junk [footballs, baseball bats,
hats and even televisions] come down from the sky and cause damage to
all characters.
Everyone's Grudge: It is a counter-attack move against normal attacks.
Death: Instant death attack, make sure you have 100x Death junctioned
ST-Def-J.

Terrible huh? You can easily counter all.. First cast Aura on Quistis
and have her cast Mighty Guard. If you are luck, you may find the entire
party with Aura status. If not, have other member cast on Squall. Keep
pressing Circle and you will be able to unleash Renzouken. Most of the
time, you will use Fated Circle, Rough Divide and Blasting Zone. As for
Lion Heart, it's rarely unless you are really in deep shit. Selphie's
usage as a great magic user comes handy in terms as a support member.
With a status protection of Protect/Regen/Shell/Haste in one turn, 
Mighty Guard really proves its worth. If entire fleet of characters are
below 200 HP, have Selphie uses Full-cure on the entire party. It's more
advisable then to got all out... or have cast Recover on one of the 
member [I would try to protect Selphie as Quistis/Squall upon using a
Phoenix Down could easily use their Limit Breaks]

========================================================================
Now you have gotten the new GF Tonberry, I would recommend you to get 
its menu abilities. [Familiar, Call Item Shop, Haggle and Discount are
extremely helpful.] With these abilities, you can also make the hell of
it. Yeah and here is a method: (I have gotten 6 million gils in an 
hour with this method; but I hoped that I could made Squall a 
billionaire ^_^;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infinite and Quick Cash Gain
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get infinite gil at any time later in the game (well, it applies 
any time after you get Tonberry to be exact).  Have Tonberry learn all 
menu abilities. Call an Item shop.  Buy as many Tents as possible. Even
without doing any SeeD Tests, I managed to accumulated sufficient cash.
You needed at most 100,000 gil (75,000 gil if you have Discount) to have 
100x Tents.

Now convert them into Mega Potions with Leviathan's Recov Med-RF 
ability. The exchange rate is 4 Tents = 1 Mega Potion. You will get 25x 
Mega Potions. Now sell them and you can get 187,500 gil in return! 
That's a quick gil.. Unlike you have to wonder and wait for a salary
payment from SeeD. If you don't like the idea of sacrificing a Tent, you
can also go nuts with Mesmerize Blade, which can be won from Mesmerize!
That's a short cut to get quick money.

Where to find this research center?
 ___________________
|                   | E stands for Edea's House and * stands for the
|                   | Deep Sea Research Facility. Just simply get 
|                   | Ragnarok and pilot towards the star and under low
|                   | attitude [you will see water splashing on the

|___________________| Ragnarok directly above. Press X to land.

If Zell's in the party, he will say that he know this place.. and you
will be given the following options:

Forget it
Let's hear it... [that island is also called Battle Ship Island..]

Now enter the area... You will find a light column. When the light 
column lightens, it gives a sound.. so don't move. Once the light is 
off, just walk.[if you move during the light, you will encounter battles
randomly..]. You need to approach the column.. And you will find a 
prompt:

"So you wish to challenge me..."
 It's not our will to fight <--

This will led to a fight against a Ruby Dragon. The battle can be a 
mean one if your characters are at very high levels with low defense [
Vit stats are critical. The Breath can does a mean damage of 9999 HP
to one character with less than 100 Vit stats.] The higher Vit, the
low the damage that the Ruby Dragon will do. In order to minimise the
damage, the best option is summon Doomtrain [make full use of Poison
Powders and Venom Fangs to boost up compatibility.] As the Ruby Dragon
is extremely to this deadly combo... 100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J. 
Doomtrain does not only cast Meltdown [lowers the Ruby Dragon's 
defense] and also Sleep. The character with 100x Blind ST-Atk-J combo
must not attack or the Ruby Dragon will awake. While the Dragon is 
asleep, cast Aura on Quistis and have her using Degenerator to 
eliminate it or have the characters with 100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J to
have the battle in sleep.

"Begging me for mercy?"
 Yeah.. there is nothing I can do [you will exit the screen]
 Never <-- second battle.

It's getting tougher.. You will face another Ruby Dragon and in 
addition, you will face a Back Attack Status. [To counter this, make
use of Cerberus' Awareness]. Just the previous method and you will be
able to finish it. Initiative [160 AP, Pandemona, Tonberry and Cactaur]
will be extremely useful.. Try to keep your character's HP maxed out
with Recover.

"Dammed Imbeciles. Why do you wished to fight?"
 For the sake of the protecting something
 None of the business (leads to another Ruby Dragon fight)
 (it's our nature) <-- [this is hidden]

Bahamut                                        | Level 100  HP: ~102,000
========================================================================
Description: Called the King of GF. It's Mega Flare call ignores all 
             defense. Gives assistance freely to those who show their
             power
Attacks:     (Claw swipe), Mega Flame, Flare.
Facts:       Strong vs. Poison. Wind/Thunder has no effect on the BOSS.
Draw:        Flare, Curaga, Full-life
AP gained:   40
Win:         1x Hyper Wrist, 1x Bahamut's Card
Mug:         1x Hyper Wrist

  |||||||||||||||||| STR  DEF ||||||||||||||||||
    |||||||||||||||| INT  SPI ||||||||||
                |||| DEX  EVA |||||
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
The Bahamut will generally gives some introduction speech like other 
GFs:

Bahamut: "I'm .... Bahamut"
Squall:  "The Great GF... Bahamut"
Bahamut: "... GF? I...?"
         "Using my powers...."
         "It's you humans... I fear..."

Unexpectedly, I did not expect to finish the Bahamut so easily... All I
have an character with 100x Blind to ST-Atk-J and it will miss its 
powerful claw swipe (err.. correction it should be powder-ful ^_^;). 
That's a method. If it hit your characters, it can does a heavy amount 
of damage to your character, about 3000+ HP.. Its Mega Flare does 
approximately the same as the Ruby Dragon.. [it's makes it a killer 
weapon]. But with the Doomtrain-Cerberus-Aura combo, I have managed to 
use numerous Limit Breaks for all characters. Mighty Guard will be quite 
useful as it could have all sorts of protection such as Protect, Shell, 
Regen and Haste. Next have the two offensive characters, Squall and 
Zell. Lion Heart has a high tendency of being used when you are at 
extremely critical status. Zell's Armageddon Fist can kill the Bahamut 
within a minute. After the battle finishes..

"Have you seen the light?"
========================================================================

So you have gotten one of best cards, Bahamut's Card [which could allow
you to get 100x Megalixirs!]. Now the Bahamut was indeed a great GF [as
it's name described, fancy giving you Ability x4, Str +60%, Mag +60%
which make it an ideal GF.] You can have better GFs if you have use 
Amnesia Greens and GF items such as Magic Armlet [Spr +60%], Adamantine
[Vit +60%], Hyper Wrist [Str +60%], Royal Crown [Mag +60%] and you can
get them easily from these major battles. Well, I just copied the 
speech down for your hard work:

Another path to your destiny awaits...
You are indeed an interesting one
brimming with passion.

To make life easier, just have Zell in the party. After finishing off

cockpit and converse your members. Now returned back to the Deep Sea
Research Center, you will find a hole there and along with a Save Point.

Use a Tent [your energy must have been exhausted from the previous fight
against the Bahamut.] Now it's time for some real business.

Warship Island. Now you will find a Save Point outside the damaged 
light system. Proceed and climb down. There you will find a Draw Point 
[Dispel] and your members will start to scatter and examine the 
equipment. There is an important term, that's called Reserve Steam 
Pressure [RSP]. Your aim to go down the pit with 10x RSP left. Just 
simply follow the diagram below and you will not get lost.

(!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toramas, Bombs, Buel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: 100x Death to ST-Atk-J to all characters
It's not tough, just to take note of Torama as it can cast Lv5 Death to
all members and splat.. It will be game over for characters with levels 
that is multiple of 5. Just gave your party this protection until you 
have reached Battle Arena #1.

        D___|________________________|________|      (2nd Option)

========================================================================
Now just simply go down the levels of the research center. In the last
facility, you will have a couple of prompts and pick the 2nd option ("
Leave it to Zell"). After wondering around, Zell manages to reduce the
RSP without using any RSP! [he's pretty good at machines, and plus a
funny scene.. where he bashes up the machine!]

Get ready you necessary preparations.. and you will fight a series
of tough fights [you should bring characters to train here..]. Next 
before I begin, there are some reminders: 
- Different enemies have different weakness. That's why it required
  different strategies and combat methods. I have normally add a "!"
  point before I make combinations with the essential requirements
  above.
- Ruby Dragons are the only monsters that you need to take care of. So
  if you have problems with it, retreat back to the previous levels
  and gain a couple of levels. Squall's Lion Heart is vital in 
  completing this section.
- This place allows you to get great ingredients such as Barriers, 
  Inferno Fangs, Energy Crystal. The Tri-face typically drops roughly
  about 6x Curse Spikes per victory. [which makes it faster to get 
  100x Curse Spikes to be refined into Dark Matter through Siren's
  Tool-RF. (GF Siren must be at Lv 100.)]

It's time to go down the pit.. Different monsters await you at different
screens (not areas). You CAN'T run away from these battles. Enc-None and
Enc-Half does no usage here.. 

In the first screen, you will find a Save Point and the first view of 
the Deep Sea Deposit. (!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Arena #1: Tri-Face
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: Squall: ST-Atk-J to 100x Blind
       Quistis: ST-Atk-J to 100x Sleep
       Mug, Rare Item and Initiative equipped.
       Treatment command
       Plus all essential equipment listed above.
This battle is pretty easy. You will only need to take note of its 
Poison Gas as you can handle the bite attack with 100x ST-Atk-J combo.
Quite an easy battle. The Tri-face only arsenal weapon is its Poison 
Gas, not quite a tough foe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just simply walk down the stairs and you will reach the next screen 
which consists of spiral paths [and that's battle arena #2] (!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grendel and Imp
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: Squall 100x Blind to ST-Atk-J, Initiative
       Quistis 100x Death to 100x ST-Atk-J
       Zell 100x Holy to Elem-Def-J
       100x Thundaga to Elem-Def-J to all characters.
This part can be quite easy too. Grendel can does a massive damage of
4000+ HP damage to a character with low Vit with its Tail Blade. To
prevent that from occurring, you need to make full use of this technique.
Don't bother to attack with Quistis and Squall, Allow Zell to do the 
attacking [The Imp can will counter with Holy who defeat it..] Just
have Squall and Quistis attack the Grendel. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you reach the winding path, you will reach an area where you will
find a draw point [Triple] and a statue next to it. (!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Arena #3: Behemoths
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: 100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J for all characters, Initiative for at least
       one character
       Draw command, Mug, Rare Item, Initiative.
The battle is perhaps an easy battle. Using 100x Death to ST-Atk-J could
killed off the Behemoths with one hit, but consider that it would be
better if you could kept in sleep. As the Behemoths could does a 
disastrous damage with its Meteor and Assault Horn. By keeping it at
sleep, you can have better EXP [the more attacks you have inflict, the
more EXP you can get.]. Plus, if you managed to get 50x Barriers, you 
can get quite a good rare item along with a huge sum of EXP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a huge fall of Behemoths slaughtering, its time to face another
tough cookie. (!). The path is long enough to last for two Ruby Dragon
fights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Arena #4: Ruby Dragon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: 100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J to all characters. Initiative for at least
       one character. Draw, Doomtrain, Revive, Recover. Auto-Haste and
       100x Triple to Spd-J for other characters.
       100x Firaga to Elem-Def-J
The toughest is here.. Yeah. The Ruby Dragon's Breath can does a 
monsterous damage to 9999 HP damage to a Vit 99 character. The higher 
the Vit, the less damage you will get. Your aim to have the Sleep 
status on the Ruby Dragon, casting Sleep magic will not do much 
compared to ST-Atk-J <-> 100x Sleep Combo. After it is asleep, summon 
Doomtrain, whereas the rest awaits and stock precious spells such as 
Flare and Meteor. You will be able to kill easily... Don't hesitate to 
waste 1x Aura spell for each battle on Quistis as you could dealt an
instant death attack with the Ruby Dragon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not sweat right? Yeah.. my party's HP is still full from the previous
battles. Anyway, this last arena is also quite easy if you know how to
play.. PS: check the rock found near the ending path and you will 
uncover an Ultima draw point!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Arena #5: 2x Iron Giants
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equip: 100x Thundaga to Elem-Atk-J
       100x Blind to ST-ATK-J for one character
       100x Sleep to ST-Atk-J for other two character
       GF Diablos, Auto-Haste, Spd-J with 100x Triple, Mug
This battle again is free gift battle.. Just simply attack and you can 
even keep them off with in a few minutes with Limit Breaks. That's a 
cheap shop. The Iron Giants could cast a tough spell, Mighty Guard.
Make use of a couple of Dispel. It will be better if you have all 
characters with ST-Atk-J. Let them sleep until they die! But I would use
the above equipment to upgrade my characters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now finally, we have reached the deposit. There is a huge crystal on the
top left hand corner. Yeah.. an secret boss is embedded in it. This area,
you may still encounter no monsters. Just equip Move-Find from GF Siren
and use it and you will find a Save Point. Use it and make these final
preparations.

100x Ultima to Str-J for all characters [even it is not, just do this.]
100x Quake to Elem-Def-J for all characters.
100x Meltdown to Vit-J for all characters
100x Triple to Spd-J for two characters [Squall and Zell]
Quistis will Initiative and Auto-Haste, Mighty Guard
Zell, with another Initiative and Aura
Squall, with Lion Heart.
Give everyone the following command screen: 
Squall: Attack, Magic, Revive, Item [must have 100x Ultima]
Quistis: Attack, Magic, Draw, Item [if does not have 100x Ultima]
Zell: Attack/Mug, Magic, Recover, Draw

Now examine the machine and make it to use up the remaining RSP and 
it's the first battle against the WEAPON! [Ultima Weapon is back!]

Strategy
This battle is crucial for those who have not save the game as if they
did not, they have start all over the game. The Ultima Weapon is tough
as it will be better if you have gotten the remaining GFs first before
you fight. First of all, let's analyse its attacks:

(Sword Swipe): one of most damaging attack that could pack as much as
               1000+ HP to a character with 200 Vit stats.
Gravija:       A very powerful attack that does damage like Demi-All.
               Practically wipe out about 3000+ ~ 5000+ HP for all 
               characters. The only way to counter this is by casting
               Mighty Guard [regen status] and follow by Curaga. I
               think it looks like the Shadow Flare in FF7.
Quake:         Earth-Elemental damage against all characters which in 
               terms could kick the butts of low HP characters at one
               shot. Make use of 100x Quake to Elem-Def-J to absorb the
               damage.
Light Pillar:  A deadly attack of 9999 HP to characters below 200 Vit.
               Very deadly as you need to have a lot of Life spells to
               remove K.O [actually it is helping you to get Limit 
               Breaks ^_^;]

Here is the method. First, cast Aura on Quistis and have her cast the 
Mighty Guard on your party. Next cast Meltdown on the Ultima Weapon. If
your damage are strong, the Ultima has a high probability of using the
Light Pillar. Get the other character to revive that character with 
Life or Revive [make sure you use a Aura after that.]. Have Zell and
Squall do the attacking whereas Quistis as the healing member on the 
character with lower HP or stock Ultima. [Her HP is be kept at the 
maximum]. Remember to draw Eden from the Ultima Weapon!

Have Squall kept on unleashing Renzoukuken and Zell on his Armageddon 
Fist. The Quake can also be a helpful weapon in terms of curing your 
wounded members. But be careful of Meteor as it could does 1000+ damage 
to a member [but Regen should be able to reduce to 500 HP. But it will 
be better to have Auto-Potion]. Gravija, the most dangerous group-
effect weapon, I would recommend to cast Curaga on the entire party. 
(every member stops or left one character to attack). If both members 
dead, use a Phoenix Pinion to inflict damage on the BOSS plus it 
revives dead characters. Remember the lower HP, Squall and his members 
have, the higher the chances, he will use the Limit Break, Lion Heart.
I take two Lion Hearts to defeat it at Level 100.

========================================================================

GF Eden is even more stronger [in fact, it is the best GF that you can
get in the game] GF Eden can does over 9999 HP damage and you can boost
it up to the maximum 250. Plus it has a couple of good abilities such
as GF Abil Med-RF, Expend 3x-1, etc. This GF can also be your most
devastating weapon next to Limit Breaks.

For those who don't like to go all that trouble in the Deep Sea Deposit,
here is a little cheat. First of all, Zell must not be in your party...
Next follow the steps here:

At the floor where you first entered the underground basement, you will
still do the same procedure by getting 16 RSP from the main machine. 
Next proceed to the first floor and use 2 RSP in the next steam machine.
Now on the 2nd floor, observe carefully as there is another machine 
under the stairs! Activate it [requires 4 RSP] and you will be able to 
enter the door on the left. There is a machine and a draw point [Esuna]. 
This machine will replenish 7 RSP. Now return back 2F. Now keep on 
using 1 RSP for each floor. Next you still under up at the machine where
Zell will meddle with it. Now use it and you will still have 10 RSP! 
That's sufficient for the steam machine. Now here is problem saving 
part. Equip Enc-None and you will encounter no battles. At the basement,
you will be able to fight the Ultima Weapon! Refer to the strategy 
above.

Shumi Village - Laguna's statue completion                    ffviii_051
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Status Guard
Magic:    Ultima - pay 5000 gil 
          Blizzaga - found at the corner where you find Elder's House
          Firaga - found behind Laguna's statue
          Regen - found next to the Save Point
          Haste - found at the Train Yard
          Shell - found next to the Junk Shop
Save Pts: Shumi - Hotel
          FH - Train track
GF:       n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been a while since you have been to Shumi... Return and proceed 
to Elder's House. Next proceed to the statue room and you will find that
the Attendant refuses to work.. Now return back to Elder's House and you
will find out the reason. Next seek the Moomba outside for help. Next 
you will find Attendant's willing to work! Next talk to Attendant and 
he will say that it will be better if Artisan would help.. Now proceed
to Artisan's House and you will know the reason why he is so upset..

Now proceed to Elder's House. Next talk to him. A stubborn... Artisan.
Well, I was nearly stucked and found out the solution. Recall all the
Moomba occurrences..

Moomba at D-District Prison - err.. can't enter it.
Moomba at FH - well, you can find one at Grease Monkey's House!
Moomba at Shumi - there are two.. One is at the entrance of Elder's 
                  House. The other one is actually a knob that triggers
                  the background music.

I guess you should know the answer by now. Proceed to Fisherman's 
Horizon! Just have Ragnarok placed vertically on top of FH and press X
to land. Next you will find Ragnarok landed at the place where you find
Martine. Now proceed to Grease Monkey's House.

At Grease Monkey's House, Squall will ask him whether the Moomba is 
real or not. Next talk to him again and he will lend you the Moomba. 
Return back to Shumi Village. Meanwhile navigate around the area.

Now return back and it's time to head towards Artisan's House. At the
house and repetitive fast-talking Moomba keep on persuade Artisan. Just
exit [don't press X...] and you will find Master Fisherman. He is 
fishing at the pond. Next noticed the background music and Artisan 
finally agrees to work! Proceed to the statue and you will see the
four of them working hard. [Sculptor, Attendant, Artisan and Moomba].
Now returned back to Elder's House and you will get Status Guard as 
your gift! Notice the background music too.

After you have gotten the President boarding on your ship, return back
to Shumi Village and you will have a sequence at the statue room.. it's
about the past.

Tutrapod: Cure, Esuna, Life
Torama: Death, Demi, Life
Iron Giant: Haste, Slow, Stop, Quake
Elynole: Pain, Holy, Double
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Now your party will be asked by Rinoa to head to Edea's house. As you
know Edea is already an experienced Sorceress on controlling her powers.
You will find Angelo in front of the house. Next enter Edea's house and 
to the area where you find the couple. After talking to both of them, 
now you exit.

At the entrance, there is a small path (anyway that area is already 
accessible upon first time in the game, but I did not mentioned it.) 
You will find Angelo and it will be heading now. Next your party, 
members will leave and Rinoa comes in. [a different situation, when 
Rinoa is in your party.] Rinoa will be asking Squall about certain
topics like whether she will fight her or not... After a short and 
sweet conversation, Zell will report to you that Esthar's President 
would like to see you. Next exit and you find Edea talking to Squall. 
Head for Esthar City where you will meet the President. Now board
Ragnarok and head to Ragnarok's Airstation. Just head north until you 
reached the elevator junction and make a turn to the north. Board that
elevator (hmm.. why is this still working?) and you will be heading to
Presidential Palace, just head left and you will reach the President's
Room.

BTW, the President of Esthar has defeated Adel the Sorceress [the 
sealed monster], 13 years ago. 

As Squall entered the room, he has found familiar faces 
Ward... and Kiros... Just walked forward and you found out that the 
President is actually Laguna Loire. [In Squall's eyes, Laguna is just 
a crappy Galbadia Soldier.. Can't believed the way, that a President of 
a such huge city will be dressed in such a simple manner.] Next talk to 
Laguna, you will be given the prompts [don't play the card, as you may
lose due to the rules that have effected while at Lunar Base]:

Explain the mission to defeat Ultemicia:
Where's Ellone? -> gives the mission briefing (a bad sense of feeling.)
Tell me about Raine -> Laguna refused to talk about it!
What are you doing here -> The past after Dream Sequence #5*

* Choose this one for those whom are playing the first time.

Pick the first option once you have known the answers. Next you will 
meet Dr Odine! He has been doing research and on a machine called "
Junction Machine Ellone" and plus a couple of reasons why Ultemicia
wants Ellone, that's for Time Compression!

Next you will be brought to the passenger's area where you will 
experienced a serious face-looking Laguna. After every one have exited,
head to the hangar and save your game. Return back here and have a card
game with Laguna and get the last card of the collection area: Squall
Leonhart! BTW, you may find some hints from Ward and Kiros.

             Fujin:  2x Megalixir.
Win:         2x Str Up, 1x Megalixir
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
Extremely easy when you have attained higher levels [level 80 and above
]. For those whom does not train, these few battles, you may not have
problems, but until Disc 4, you will be in hot soup. I have experienced
that before. Luckily, I have managed to sufficient Aura spells.

This battle is quite easy. Just simply summon Doomtrain and start 
stocking up Full-Life [Fujin is the best boss for this stock, as Full-
Life is great for HP.] Next summon GF Eden and you can called this 
battle off. Have Tornado and Thundaga as your two basic Elem-Def-J so,
it will not be that painful. Try to have these 3 ST-Atk-J attack combos,
Silence, Blind, Sleep [give Sleep to the fastest character, or the 
person with Auto Haste]. Just don't summon Pandemona and Quezacotl.

========================================================================

After defeating those two groupies, exit from this area. Head up and
make a left turn, there you will meet Biggs and Wedge, talking to 
them. Don't worry there are no battles, as they are sick of fighting 
you. Now enter the building [there is a Save Point somewhere near the
building]. Next you will be on the path, which leads to the second
elevator. Next head for the 02 elevator. 

You will be brought to the elevator junction. Draw Curaga and you have
been here during the first visit. Next board Elevator 01. You can find
the Holy draw point [but you can't draw it from the second time] If you 
have acquired GF Siren's Move-Find ability, you will find a Save Point 
there [should use it and store HP back to full]. Head up and you will
find Fujin and Raijin. They will not fight you, instead they summoned
that monster which has thrown your members out once, to attack your 
party!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy

Personally, this boss gets easier as you are at high levels and have 
higher powers. This BOSS typically could attack as a whole or with it's
Left and Right Probe. You need to watch out for this messages:

Mobile Weaponary attack mode ON
Support Weaponary attack mode OFF

During this, the BOSS will fight as a whole using its tentacle whip
and you can still do damage to it's probes. It can also use its Twin
Homing Laser as a counter-attack. 

Mobile Weaponary attack mode OFF
Support Weaponary attack mode ON

Now this is simply the reverse. The main body does not attack. But 
instead the left/right probes are attacking. They will counter attack
your attacks with Twin Homing Laser [if you attack the respective
probes.] If you stay for too long, the BOSS along with the probes
will unleashes the Corona, which drops everyone's HP to 1. Just then, 
quickly draw and cast Curaga or the Recover Command. 

In order to win this battle easily, focus your attacks on the Mobile 
Type 8. The left Probe and Right Probe has higher defence. Get 100x
Thundaga to Elem-Atk-J and you can make the hell out of it. Best of
all, you can see the Lion Heart Limit Break when everyone's HP drops
to one.... [but it is a bit risky.]
========================================================================

Restore all your HP and prepared for Disc 3 final showdown. Enter the 
building and you will find Seifer on the top of the pillar, bragging
about his ability. Ellone was being held captive by Fujin and Raijin. 
After some talk, Fujin and Raijin finally got into their senses and 
tell Seifer to stop. But he refuses. As a result, they would like ask 
Squall to defeat him to make the old Seifer back. After they will leave 
and you will fight Seifer. Prepared for the last battle with Seifer.

Strategy

Without Odin
He is not tough, in fact the lousiest BOSS of all Disc 3. You want to
why, because you can drawn the Aura spell and use it for yourself. Use
your finishing moves and gave him a ticket to Planet Doom. ^_^; Or
make of this opportunity to stock up Aura...

With Odin
At the beginning of battle, the Odin rushes out.. But was cut into half 
by Seifer!
Squall:   "Odin....!?"
Seifer:   "Hah, I won't go down that easy."
          "Show me what you got, Squall."
          "Let me add another scar for you!"
Don't be sad... and you will also get some scenes... Just stock up 300x
Aura and wait. The Bloodfest is only attack that does have high damaging
effects and it affects all characters. Just cast Triple->Regen and wait.

After the battle has last for long enough.. a new GF appears
Gilgamesh: "You gave me? the 4th one...!"
           "Huh? Was it you...?" (I thought Gilgamesh will help Seifer)
           "Then dodge my sword!"
           "Eat this!!!"
Seifer:    "Ergwahhhh!!!!"
Gilgamesh  "Where is the dimensional interval....?" [^_^;]

========================================================================

Well that's is the end of Seifer Almasy..... After the battle, Rinoa 
will start to move away.. Suddenly, Seifer awakes! He will kidnap Rinoa! 
Seifer holding Rinoa as hostage and head for the chamber where the 
sealed Adel is.... End of Disc 3. 

Note: If Rinoa is in your party, you will be able to re-organize your 
      party.

Walkthrough for Disc 4
========================================================================
This section is considered as the most difficult section as you are 
going to face the most difficult bosses of the game. After several days
of consistence, I have managed to beat the game once again and get 
"almost" all the secrets that can be found in the game. I myself still
believe that there are still some more hidden stuffs for me to cover.

- I have added the Water Gate Incident inside the walkthrough.
- I have also re-edit some parts of the section on Ultimecia's Castle. 
  There are actually many keys.. such as the Floodgate Key, Treasure 
  Vault Key, Prison Key.
- I have found a way to obtain a second rare card. The trick has been
  tested by me and it was sent by someone [mentioned in the credits
  section]. I have tried and it works for Gilgamesh's Card.

Strategy

Other Member: "Gotta to save Rinoa" -> Rinoa's HP must not drop to 0
Squall:       "Just go for Adel" -> attack only Adel
Rinoa:        "Ahhhh..!" -> she need help!

This battle is a bit tough for those whom have characters with levels
below 40. Yeah.. The minimum level to battle Adel is at Level 55. I have
managed to scrap through with that Level. Note that you can't harm 
Rinoa (but you can steal from her ^_^;). I think her HP varies from 
4000 to 9036. Remember that once Rinoa dies, you will get a game over.

First of all, let's focuses on Adel's arsenal of weaponry:
Drain - she will only drains HP from Rinoa [700+ HP each time]. Stock 
and cast Regen on Rinoa [She has the Regen spell right?]. 
Magic (Meteor, Ultima)- A character with a Spr stats of 50 will meet 
their doom in 2 turns. Just junction Curaga to boost up Spirit. Cast
Regen on the entire part and it will help. Ultima is rare used but
it can does around 2000+ to each member and affects the entire party.
Make sure that everyone's HP is above 3000+ at all times. She will
unleash strong magic after this phrase: "Magical Powers are 
concentrated on Adel"
Energy Bomber - 50% of the damage based on Vit and the other 50% is
based on Spr. So its damage isn't that great compared to the Meteor
or Ultima.

The best party is the guy's team, [Quistis can also be a good option
her.]. Irvine Kinneas and Zell's Limit Break packs a punch! Remember 
for those who are using Zell, do not use the My Final Heaven Limit 
Break and those who are using Irvine, do not use Shotgun Ammo, Pulse
Ammo and Fire Ammo. All group attacks should be avoid, including GFs
and group-based magic such as Ultima, Meteor, Quake, Tornado, etc.
Holy magic is highly recommended. Why don't use Squall? There are 
about 55% chances that Squall will use the Blasting Zone and Fated
Circle in his finishing blow. His Limit Breaks are too damaging 
somehow. This is the time when I found him least useful in combat.

========================================================================

After the battle, both Laguna and Ellone will come to you and you will
have another sequence. Ellone will drove away the spirit of Adel and 
thus bringing back Rinoa's spirit. After a short chit-chat, Laguna and
Ellone will leave and you will have an CGI of Time Compression. And 
there is a thing that bothers me.. where is Seifer?

PS: You can't use any of those fake Save Points, accept for the first 
    one.

You will be brought to the Commencement room, where Rinoa first 
encounter Edea in person.

As you landed on ground, noticed that Rinoa has disappear! There you 
will find a Save Point. Before approaching it, make sure that your
party are back to full health and touch the Save Point. Next a dozen
of them will appear. Now walk down the pathway to the door. Next the
screen will turn white and you find Edea. Next you will find Edea-like 
structures and split into two. It's BOSS fight between the Sorceress of 
different era. Now you need to fight about 11 of them before
you will actually fight the BOSS.

Strategy
Well, the sequence goes like this. As you defeat them, you will proceed 
to the next area. The first eleven of them are quite easy to defeat 
except for the Sorceress "Final". The words within "--" is actually my 
own form of denoting the difference between the Sorceresses. They all 
are called Sorceress and they are different dressed into three groups.

The place will change each time after you have defeated a Sorceress. 
They are quite easy (just like the Jelleye), I actually risked my 
battles in order to find the stats by using the Leviathan's Recover 
and found the stats. Fortunately, I managed to defeat them by using 
Cerberus and Meteor. 

You will proceed in this order:
 ______________________________________________________________
|                              |                               |
|   1. Commencement Room       |  6.  Bika- Snowfield (Trabia) |
|   2. Timber Town             |  7.  Outside Balamb Garden    |
|   3. Rinaul Shores (Balamb)  |  8.  Inside D-District Prison |
|   4. Esthar City Area        |  9.  Fire Cavern              |
|   5. Balamb Training Center  |  10. Winhill Town             |
|______________________________|_______________________________|

After eliminating all those disturbances, you will be transported to
an unknown place, where you will meet the Sorceress "Final". The 
Sorceress is quite tough if your characters have very low HP and low
levels [Regen is very helpful here.]. The BOSS has a creepy touch 
which does 1,000+, which will bring low HP characters to death easily. 
[the damage will be minimized along with Vit Junction.] After, you 
have injured the BOSS severely, it started to have a countdown of 5, 
similar to the Jenova Synthesis last battle at North Crater and it 
will cast Ultima on your members. Defeat the BOSS and you will be back 
at Edea's house! The "Final" Sorceress will use creepy touch to counter
your attacks. But it does not mean that it is impossible to defeat it.

Frankly speaking.. So far, I haven't use a Limit Break yet.. except for
the BOSS Fight against Ultima Weapon. I just attack with Status ailments
and life is really easy for me in the game. 
========================================================================

At Edea's House, head for the place where you have meet Edea [just walk 
up and turn right and enter the door on the north]. Next you will find
a bloodshed of dead Sorceress SeeDs plus a CGI of the creepy Ultemicia
Castle.

Now the area will switch to a screen with two bodies of dead White SeeD 
cadets. Next head up and make a turn at the stairs, hopefully that you 
have remember the path during the childhood [it's has blocked off by 
those stupid colored strings!]. Next you will find more dead bodies and 
a Draw Point [Triple] there and you will need to head up that huge 
chain. On the left side, there were three doors. Press X to jump on the 
ledge in front of the doors.

The doors lead to the outside world...
_______
 | 1 |      The door nearest to the Ultimecia's Castle.
_|___|_     The door leads to the Grandidi Forest and you will find the 
            Chocobo Holy Area there. The Chocobo Holy is located 
            northwest from the door. 
_______
 | 2 |      The door in the middle of the three doors.
_|___|_     The door leads to the Centra- Serrengetti Plains where you 
            find the Centra Ruins. It is located northwest from the 
            Ruins.
_______
 | 3 |      The door nearest to Edea's house.
_|___|_     This door leads to the Galbadia area where you will find 
            the Missile Base. It is east from the Missile Base. 
_______
 | 4 |      I will call this a hidden door as it leads to the place
_|___|_     where you find the Ragnarok [it's on the right side of the
            chain]. The door will be only uncovered upon entering from
            the door.

The Last Quest                                                ffviii_055
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Chubby Chocobo's Card, Phoenix's Card, Doomtrain's Card, 
          Kiro's Card, Irvine's Card, 10x Holy Wars, 1x Gilgamesh Card
Magic:    Life - 2F of Ragnarok
          Full-Life - Hangar of Ragnarok
Save Pts: Hangar
GF:       n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters
n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's time to get your ultimate airship, Ragnarok. Just take the path 
from the 1st door [that leads to Grandidi Forests] and just simply head 
northwest from it. You will encounter some of strongest foes such as the
Marlboros and Hexdragons in that forests. To avoid them, equip Enc-None.

Just simply walk through that thick forests and find a huge Chocobo
Forests. [you should know the shape by now..]. Just simply enter the 
forest and get a Chocobo from there. For my case, I have found six 
Chocobos already.

After gotten Chocobo, do not press X. Just go through the western side
of Esthar Continent. You will find those transparent barriers along 
your way. Remember that Chocobo can cross shallow waters as due to 
their quickness [I suppose that the Chocobos here are more powerful..]

Just simply wonder down the continent and you will find great 
Khashabald Desert.. Southeast of that great desert [from World Map 
point of view. The red dot that's not moving is actually the Ragnarok]
you will find a path lead into the desert and you will find the 
Ragnarok landed next the door. Now unboard from the Chocobo and enter 
Ragnarok and press the following:

Press Circle [this will lead to the cockpit] and hold Triangle.

You will reached the sequence, if you battle all the CC Group members
in the Balamb Garden. At the haul, you will meet Xu and she will talk
to Squall that CC Group has come to seek for revenge and decide to 
challenge him for cards once more. Here is list, where you will
encounter them:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Member                Location
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CC Group Heart        Haul of the Ragnarok
CC Group Spade        Hangar
CC Group Diamonds:    Main Hall
CC Group Jack:        Hallway that's located on right side of the Haul
CC Group Club:        2F- Stairway
CC Group Joker:       You will find this guy near the elevator [where
                      you need to board to head for Ragnarok.]
CC Group King:        Just get Quistis in your party and head for the
                      cockpit and challenge her for the card game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtually, the CC Group Members have hold all the cards that you have 
not collect since the beginning of the game. [except for the Cards that
you have used Card-Mod, which you will find status screen saying "Used
Up"]. Now this is really an headache. First of all, they will start to
add rules each time you battle them. Like in this order:

Balamb - Dollet - Galbadia - Trabia - FH - Centra - Esthar - Lunar Base

Worst still, the cards do not appear all the time.. You may depend a 
lot on luck. Remember that you must getting the card according to the
card order in the card page. That means if you haven't gotten the 
Phoenix's and Doomtrain's Card, you must gotten the Phoenix's Card 
before you could challenge them for the last cards. Some of the cards 
that is originally found with CC Group Members such Leviathan being 
found from the CC Group Magician Joker, will only be won from the 
original owner only. The more rules you add [by challenging them, they
will add rules], the more chances you will get the rare cards in the
game. BTW, the above cards that you found here can be obtained from the
Card Queen's Quest, which is, described in detail in Part I.

There are two rare cards for Gilgamesh. First of all, you must get the
Gilgamesh from the CC Group King. There you must modified it using
Card-Mod and get 10x Holy Wars. Now head for the haul and challenge
Xu for a card game and you will see another Gilgamesh card! Currently,
I am still trying out for other cards. 

How to win card battles? Here is what I normally do [even my own 
record does seems that great, I have only ~40% winning percentage 
compared to my brother's ~50% winning percentage. But I have played 
over a thousand card games, whereas my brother has only play 20 card
games (but he has played the tougher ones more often).]... Once you 
reached the Ragnarok, head to the Ragnarok to save your game. Next 
challenge for cards, [most of the rare cards are obtained Diamonds], 
and get the rare card. If you lost a rare card, reset and replay again. 
Once you have gotten a rare card, save your game and then resume. Make 
sure you don't lose any rare cards, or it will be much harder.. Here
is a brief summary on how I play card games with the following rules:
[I only include the tough ones]

Random: don't bother whether it is lousy cards or rare cards. Just 
shoot. In my opinion, some of Level 4~5 cards are great for Plus and
Same Rule. They could kill my opponent through Card Combo and Plus.

Same/Plus: Just required some more mental calculations. If you are not
quite good in mathematics, just use a calculator. Plus rule is more
useful compared to the Same Rule in my opinion. You can even make use of
this to turn over the tables at your opponent. Imagine that I have only
1 card left on the board and the last slot, I put. I got a straight 
combo with Pluses and Same. As the result, I won. [That's all I got 
Edea's card.]

Sudden Death: Never ever place your most powerful cards on the board
under this rule. Remember that you need to protect them. As if it ended
up with a draw, you will continue with the cards that you have earlier
got under your control. This is most dangerous rule in my opinion.

The rest are not that importance, but do not ignore them as they are
quite helpful. If you have forgotten the rule, just press Circle while
having the game and a glimpse of the summary. One last tip: no matter
how strong your opponent are, there is always a glimpse of hope in
defeating them. Never give up!

After done with this, you can pay a visit to the Card Queen at the 
Abadan Plains where you first met Piet at Crashed Lunar Base.

Now head back to the door where Ragnarok is originally situated and 
enter the door to head back to Ultimecia Castle.
 _____
/ 6.3 \_________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultemicia Castle - the sealed truth                           ffviii_056
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    1x Megalixir, 1x Elem Atk, 1x Diamond Armor, 1x Rocket Engine,
          1x Magic Armlet, 1x Status Attack, 1x Status Guard, 1x Elem 
          Guard, 1x Rosetta Stone
Magic:    Flare - entrance of Ultimecia Castle
          Meltdown - draw point at Art Gallery
          Curaga - draw point at the passageway
          Slow - draw point at the courtyard
Save Pts: Entrance of Ultimecia Castle
          The desert walkway
          Before Ultemicia's Room
GF:       Pandemona - Red Giant
          Leviathan - Trauma
          Alexander - Catobelpas
          Tri-Point - Siren
          Gargatua - Cerberus
          Krysta - Carbuncle
          Eden - Tiamat
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters:
All
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the entrance, you will find a Save Point on the left, along with a
hidden draw point at the right. Next Squall will spilt up his team into 
2 parties. One of the parties will follow Squall, whereas the remaining
three will form the other party. Now they will enter the place of their 
most horror nightmare! Upon entering the castle, you find the area being
covered with green blinking light, followed the message below:

The parties' powers have been sealed by Ultimecia.

[Item]  - sealed the item menu and item command.
[Magic] - sealed the magic menu and magic command.
[GF] - sealed GF command
[Draw] - sealed Draw command
[Command Ability] - seal Commands and Ability menu
[Limit Break] - seal Limit Breaks
[Resurrection] - seal from reviving dead members
[Save] - seal from saving, using Save Points in the game.

Now you need to fight the eight monsters found in the Ultimecia Castle.
To break the seal, you must uncover their traces in the Castle and 
defeat them. At the beginning, you are only to use the Attack Command.

Now you will find green spots called "Party Switch Point" or in short
form, I will call "PSP". PSP will allows you to have the following
options upon entering the area:

Party Switch Point
  "Switch to other party"
  "Change party members"
  "Cancel"

The first option allows you to switch between Alpha and Beta parties.
The second option allows you to change members of the party. Usable
when all members of the team [6 members] are at the PSP. The third
option allows you to do nothing

Now let's beginning to disperse our units into two teams:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha Party: Squall, Zell, and Rinoa
- why this arrangement?
I like this combination as it has great attacking prospects along 
with great defence. Squall and Zell can do the attacking while Rinoa
could be a great healer. Squall's Lion Heart is almost unstoppable.
Zell's Duel can be chained and causes huge amount of damage. Rinoa's
Angel Wing can cast different magic and Angelo combination is also
quite massive.

Beta Party: Irvine, Quistis, and Selphie
- why this arrangement?
This combination is ought to be more devastating compared to the 
previous party. Irvine can really knocked out anyone with his Shot 
combo. Quistis can really boost up the team's speed, defence and 
magical defence from her Mighty Guard. Plus her Shockwave Pulsar can
inflict tremendous damage (over 9999 HP). Selphie, on the other hand,
has superb Limit Breaks such as Full-cure and Wall. She can really 
become a great support character.

GFs? There is no need to disperse them ^_^;. You can have all GFs onto
one party. You can used Switch menu and select through the Junction
Exchange and the junction of the previous character along with the
magic in that character will be automatically gives to them. The only
weakness on this method is that you may need to waste magic in 
restoring HP. But it really saves the trouble. 

Magic requirements (the list is a bit quite long)
- Status magic does not provide much help against the BOSSES here. But 
  for the monsters, they are extremely important.
- 100x Esuna - for at least 3 characters -> fix status ailments
- 100x Silence - for at least 3 characters -> ST-Def-J
- 100x Death - for at least 3 characters -> ST-Def-J

- 100x Blizzaga - for at least 3 characters -> Elem-Def-J

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Alpha]
You will find the boss at the main stairway. Note, that you can only
use the attack command as other commands are being sealed off.
 _________
/ BOSS 31 \_____________________________________________________________
========================================================================
Sphinxaur                                       | Level 56  HP:  10,000 
========================================================================

              whose abilities are sealed.
Attacks:      Firaga, Magic Summon, Doom, (Charge), Blizzaga
Facts:        Weak against Ice
Draw:         Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga
AP gained:    31 AP [differs based on number of monsters]
Win:          1x Megalixir
Mug:          n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
Since you have make Squall included in the main party, there is no need
to change the party's junctions. This BOSS is not even a match against
the Grendel that you encounter at the Island closest Hell. Just attack
and you can easily finished it. The only thing to take note is its 
Magic Summon and the BOSS could call for additional monsters such as
Jelleye, etc. Just go for the BOSS, Squall could do damage up to 5000
with 255 Str stats. You see the mask breaks as an indication that you
have does a damage of 10,000 HP to the BOSS.

Release Seal: Magic / Draw [if you haven't gotten Leviathan]
* You can fight the Sphinxaur as the second boss by going around him [
  make sure that you do not make contact with it] and fight the Tri-
  Point or any other BOSSES.
========================================================================

This area is called the Hall. After you defeat this BOSS, you find
the 4-way junction. Just take the right path and go to the door on the
right. Next you will reach a spiral stairway, where you will find a bell
along with PSP. Just simply enter the door. [as for the bell, you can
mess with it later.]

Junction Preparations: 100x Tornado to Elem-Atk-J for all characters

Now you will be at the Art Gallery. Here is a little diagram to help 
you out:

........................................................................

NOTE: You can draw Meltdown from the Draw Point found at this area.
Well with the map, this should be any problem. Take a look at ALL 
paintings. Next head for the main picture [marked + in the map] and 
you will given the list of pictures that you have seen before. Now
you need to solve the puzzle and here is the way:

In the Art Gallery, you will see a big clock painted on the floor. The
three hands show VIII, VI and IIII.
Look at all the Pictures and pick the following I, V and X

Title           Found       Status
IGNUS           I           Fire
INANDANTIA      II          Flood
IUDICIUM        III         Judgement
INTERVIGILIUM   IIII*       Sleep
VENUS           V           Love
VIATOR          VI*         Messenger
VIGIL           VII         Watchman
VIVIDARIUM      VIVII*      Garden (delete the 2nd V)
INAUDAX         IX          Cowardice
XYSTUS          X           Tree-lined Road
XEPAMPELINAE    XI          Red Clothes
XIPHIAS         XII         Swordfish

Now examine the big picture and you should get messages like the one
below:
The title is...
It is too faint to read
The title of this picture is ....

The hands of the clock show 8 (VIII), 4 (IIII) and 6 (VI)
Therefore the answer for the puzzle is VIVIDARIUM, INTERVIGILIUM and
VIATOR. 

"VIVIDARIUM ET INTERVIGILIUM ET VIATOR" which means 
[In the Garden, sleeps a messenger]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the hidden letters of the painting will be uncovered and the
second BOSS will appear. Contact with it and you will find the following
phrase "Face my wrath for seeking thy sealed power." and you might 
guessed it, another BOSS fight!

========================================================================
Description: Trauma - Ultimecia gave partial life to this weapon of the
             future. Pulse Cannon destroys any enemies in its way.
             Droma - Born from Trauma. A small support machine. Despite
             its small size uses Pulse Cannon just like Trauma.
Attacks:     Trauma: Drain, (Create), Pulse Cannon, (Whip)

Strategy
The Trauma can inflict damage to all characters with its Pulse Cannon.
And it really packs a punch! Almost all status attacks are pretty 
useless against them. Don't bother to attack the Dromas as they don't
do much damage. In fact the Trauma can create endless of them to attack
all your members. Once two Dromas are being killed in a row, the Trauma
will unleash its deadly Pulse Cannon. Make use of Meltdown -> Tornado
combo to defeat the BOSS. Tornado is a great spell against this BOSS
as it increase the amount of damage inflict by 50%. BTW, the Dromas
can mugged for Meteor Stones. So make sure you have the Mug command.

Break Seal: Draw/ Magic [based on the choice before]
*** Note this is last time to get GF Leviathan for those whom haven't
    gotten it.
========================================================================

* Equip Draw for all characters

Now behind the door of the Art Gallery, leads to the Flood Gate. There
you will find an area that looks like the map below:

Enter the door located in the north and you will another PSP and you 
will find two stairways heading up to the other side. Now head down
to the Flood Gate. [just walk up]. Just proceed to the door "mmm" and 
it will lead to the Prison Cell. Your party will be locked up.. Next you
will find a corpse and you will find a key marked by *1 [Prison Key] and 
the BOSS will automatically appears and it's another BOSS Fight!

========================================================================
Description: A giant machine powered by magic. Its high defence makes it
             difficult to damage except with Magic or GF.
Attacks:     (Swipe), Gigantic Sword, (Punch)
Facts:       n/a
Draw:        Demi, Pandemona
AP gained:   30
Win:         1x Diamond Armor
Mug:         n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
Have you ever wonder why I pick "Draw" over others? GF Diablos also 
works well against this BOSS as it could does 9999 HP damage, but it
requires time. Draw, on the other hand, could allow you to save Demi in
your stock and does an equalvent damage to the Diablos. If you used
physical attacks [which is reduce by 1/2], the BOSS will say the 
following:

"GWahaHA! PHysical attackS? USeleSS!"

But if you are smart enough, use Demi and the Red Giant will say, 

"Urgh! N-NO more DEMI, pleaSE...!" ^_^;

After you defeat damage around 15,000 HP, the BOSS will throw away his
sword. It is also a great opportunity to draw GF Pandemona. Just keep
on using Demi, you will noticed that the damage drops gradually as it
inflicts 1/4 of the BOSS current HP. After that, start to use attacks
and you will be able to finish it easily.

Sealed Ability: Command Ability [critical important.]
========================================================================

Beta
Okay, now it's time for the other team to do some business. Head for 
the north door of the main hall, where you will find the first BOSS.
Next in the area, walk onto the unstable chandelier [whole party] and 
you will fall directly onto the Grand Hall. Examine the hatch and you 
will find the following prompt. 

The hatch on the floor is broken. Would you like to open it?
Yes <--
No

Preparations:
Junction 100x Thundaga to Elem-Def-J. Equip Recover and Draw Command

Next walk down and you find the Wind Cellar. South of that area, you 
will find the 4th BOSS, a flying monster. Just examine the BOSS and you 
will see the familiar phrase.

Tri-Point: "USING ELEMENTAL ATTACKS"
           "WHATEVER I DON'T USE, I DON'T LIKE" 

This battle is quite easy and you can defeat the BOSS within a 
minute time. The BOSS will auto-counter with attacks using Mega Spark
which carries a Thunder element, which you absorb it through 100x 
Thundaga to Elem-Def-J. That's not the main problem. If the Tri-Point
ever use Scan on your characters, it was start to use the Onrush, a
desperate charging attack which is 3 times the power of the attacks.
Immediately use Recover to restore the HP.

Sealed Ability: Limit Break / Resurrection
========================================================================

You will find a hidden draw point [Aura] within the wine barrels found

Head for the chapel and you will find a huge organ and here the 
controls [I guess there is nothing hidden here, unlike in FF7 you can 
get Tifa's Final Heaven through playing the piano.]. You can draw Dispel
from the draw point found in the chapel.

Now head up the stairs on the right, there you will find the key which
will fall onto the ground as soon as before you can reached it. [
actually you can get it, if you walk towards it] Next head back to the 
PSP inside the Grand Hall [note that you will be able to force the lever 
down which prevents the chandelier from falling] and switch to the 
other party, which should be at the front of Flood Gate.

Alpha
* Choose the Switch Menu. Junction Exchange allows you to use switch
  between Junction easily. Now have magic command, draw command and
  use Command Ability too.

Now controlling the other party, head back to the basement and you will
find a shiny item on the southeast corner of the screen, examine it and
take the key [Armory Key]. You need to get the Armory into other to
enter the room. You will find a Vysage... examine it and you will see 
the phrase.

Strategy
Fighting Vysage, Lefty, Righty
All of them are typically weak against Blind and Bio status attacks. 
They are quite easy as you can called it off by summoning GF Alexander.
Just simply knocked out Vysage and Righty first. As they could does
damage with status ailments and magic such as Meteor. After they have
been defeated, you will eventually meet up with the BOSS, Gargantua.
Sigh causes Doom, so remember to cure it as the fight is continuous

Fighting against Gargantua
This battle is quite easy... Just get someone equipped with Treatment
command and protected against Sleep, Berserk, Confuse, Death. If you
attack the BOSS, the BOSS will counter-attack with the Counter Twist
(can does a lot of heavy damage). The BOSS's Evil Eye can does a mean
status ailments of Curse/Slow on your characters. Just simply get 
someone with the Treatment command to call it off. Just having a 
Meltdown-Aura-Limit Break can killed off the BOSS easily. Remember to
draw Cerberus for those whom haven't gotten it at Disc 2.

Head back to the Hall where to you encounter the Sphinxuar. Go up the 
stairs and enter the room located on the left. Now walk down and you 
will find a dark corridor, which has windows on the left. [there is a 
room here on the left, where you can accessed it using Treasure Vault
Key found next to the fountain.] But I would not recommend you to do it 
now. Just head north to the elevator room. [Make sure that this team
comprises of at least 2 females.] Just imagine the elevator as a 
balance.

Strategy
The BOSS will start off the battle with following speeches:
" I am Catoblepas."
" What do you humans plan to do..."
" Against the likes of me..."

This BOSS is looks so cool.. and looks quite alike the Behemoth. 
Believe it or not, this guy is pretty easy to defeat. Unlike the 
Behemoth, it has strong defences against status ailments. So that means,
you must watch for that Assault Horn. It has a pretty weak defence and
normal attacks can do 7000+ HP damage if your Str stats are 255. The
BOSS will cast Meteor after its death. Make sure that character's HP 
are all above 2000. The BOSS is weak against Water/Earth element. Have 
that to your advantage. Remember to draw Alexander for those whom 
haven't gotten it. 

Break Seal: It's up to you. I would recommend GF

Now proceed up back south and head towards the Hall. [at the stairway

attack weapon, which does damage according to your characters' Vit. 200+ 
Vit stats could only minimize the damage to 700+. Try to avoid using 
attacks and instead rush out for the magic. Don't bother to use Blizzaga
or Shiva. Instead draw-cast Holy will be a nice idea, compared to 
attacks. The BOSS may have strong attacks such as Ultima [which does 
2000+ to characters with a Spirit stats of 100+] and it affects all 
characters. Just make sure that you have two great commands such as
Recover and Revive. Remember to draw Carbuncle for those whom have 
missed already on.

Break Seal: Item/ Save
========================================================================
Now walk across the chandelier and head back to the area where you find
the bell. Use that PSP.

Alpha
* Perform a Junction Exchange and cure everyone's HP to full. Junction
  100x Thundaga and 100x Firaga to Elem-Def-J or 100x Flare to 
  Elem-Def-J

It's time to complete the unfinished quest. Now head to back to 
courtyard area through the northern door in the Grand Hall. Just take
the northeast path, which leads to the Water Gate. The water should be
drained off already. Just walk left and you will find a straight path
leading towards west. Examine the area and you can pick up a Rosetta 
Stone, which allows your members to learn the Ability x4. The door 
located south from her leads to the Prison Cell. Now head back to the
Courtyard and take the path towards the chapel. Now walk up the stairs 
on the right. Cross the wooden bridge. The ladder takes to the lower
section of the clock tower [which is the water gate]. Now walk up the 
winding path [it's a long way..] Now you will find a huge bell swinging
from right to left. Now head and position yourself near the edge. Wait 
for the bell to come and press X. Now your party will be taken to the 
hole.. Next you will find the toughest BOSS among eight BOSSES in the 
castle. It looks quite like the Bahamut... [actually it is also formerly 
a GF!]

Strategy
The eight BOSSES' strongest monster.. battle at the Clock Tower. The 
Tiamat looks extremely cool, and I think it is coolest BOSS in FF8 [
besides GF BOSSES and Weapons]. To defeat it, you need a couple of great
Elem-Def-J. It's Dark Flare works like Ruby Dragon's Breath and attack 
based on Vit stats. 100+ Vit characters are bound to suffer ~9600 HP 
damage. There is a way to absorb the damage that's by junctioning Flare
or Thundaga and Firaga to Elem-Def-J. As the Tiamat starts to elevate
higher, it is going to use its Dark Flare [D-A-R-K  F-L-A-R-E]. You will
see a message box to it will starts to use Dark Flare and it affects all
allies. This is the time where Elem-Def-J comes extremely handy. Just
go all at the Tiamat. Make use of Limit Breaks [Squall's Renzoukuken has
a high probability of using Lion Heart]. Remember to draw Eden if you
haven't draw it from the Ultima Weapon.

Break Seal: Save/ Item
=========================================================================

After the battle, examine and check for another hidden Draw Point 
[Triple] after the battle. Now with all seal broken off, it's time to 
battle Ultimecia or for those whom want an additional Three Stars, you
can battle the Omega Weapon.

Just walk back to the bell and climb onto it. Walk up and you should 
enter a room that is full of gears. There you will find another draw
point [Stop]. Now cross the hands of the clock face and climb down the
ladder. Eventually, you will find a path leading to the Master Room. 
Use the Save Point there, SAVE your game and its time for the ultimate 
combat against the strongest foe at Ultemicia Castle, The Omega Weapon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparations:
- Make sure you have no magic junctioned to Elem-Atk-J. The Omega 
  absorbs all elements.
- You need to gather all the rare cards. Card mod all the cards. Now
  head to Ability menu and use Call Item Shop [from the Tonberry], and
  buy at least 50x Amnesia Greens. [Look for Pet Shops] If you have 
  insufficient cash, refer to the infinite gil cheat under getting
  Tonberry Section.
- Card Mod? Yes. If you have gotten all the cards and you will find
  a yellow star next to the cards. Even if you card-mod all the rare 
  cards, you will still find the star next to the Card menu.
  [not necessary all.. but best to do so.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next I would recommend you to customize your GFs for this final fight.
Just eliminate those lousy ones with an Amnesia Greens [such as SumMag
+10%, and replaced with SumMag +40% or other ability]. Generally there
are some rules:

- Each GF can have only 1 ability learnt for that kind of skill. Let
  say for SumMag +20%, you can have only 1x SumMag +20%. That means you
  can't use a Star Fragment [SumMag +20%]. GFs can only learn up to
  22 abilities.
- Make sure that they have mastered all the abilities before starting
  this changing process.
- Under any circumstances, do not remove great abilities, especially
  menu abilities and Boost. They are critically important. 
- To defeat the Omega, you must have the following:
  - 3x Spd-J - separate the three GFs (Cerberus, Eden, Pandemona) and
    use 100x Triple as the key junction. Make use of items such as
    Jet Engine and Rocket Engine to boost up Spd.
  - 1x Auto-Haste - from GF Cerberus (you can get this by using a
    Accelerator, through Card-Mod Kiros' Card). 
  - 3x Vit-J - Shiva, Quezacotl, Carbuncle [if you have insufficient,
    don't hesitate to buy 1x Vit-J Scroll from Timber Pet Shop (must
    have Familiar)] Use Meltdown as the main spell for defence. Make
    use of Turtle Shell, Orichalon and Adamantine to boost up Vit.
  - 3x Str-J - Ifrit, Brothers, Pandemona [if you have insufficient,
    don't hesitate to buy 1x Str-J Scroll from Timber Pet Shop (must
    have Familiar)] Use Ultima as the main spell for offence. Use 
    Items such as Strength Love, Power Wrist and Hyper Wrist to boost
    up Strength.
  - 3x Spr-J - Typically to reduce damage done by Meteor and Ultima.
    Crucially important as Omega has 255 Mag Stats. Use Curaga as the
    key boost. Use items such as Rune Armlet, Force Armlet and Magic 
    Armlet to boost up Spr.
  - 3x Mag-J - to make healing more effective. Just get Meteor to 
    boost up the stats. Use items such as Hypno Crown, Royal Crown
    to boost up magic.
  - 3x HP-J - you need as much as 9999 HP as it could does a 9998 HP
    damage to all characters. Just remember that the Omega is a nuts.
    Use Full-life as the key booster. Use items such as Giant's Ring
    and Gaea's Ring to have better abilities such as HP +80%
  - 100x Life - as many as possible. As the Omega's Light Pillar (
    err, isn't it the same name as Ultima Weapon's trademark?) can 
    does 9999 HP irregardless of Vit and Spr. 
  - All characters' strength stats must reach 255. If you can't hit
    it, try to use Str +60% through Hyper Wrist. 
  - All characters must have protection against Death.
  - 1st: Attack, Magic, Draw, Item [with Auto-Haste]
    2nd: Attack, Magic, Draw, Revive
    3rd: Attack, Magic, Draw, Recover.
  - On the item screen arrange the following into your first page:
   ____________________
  | Name          NUM  | Just spend your money mainly on Mega Phoenix
  | Megalixir     100  | as they are extremely important for this 
  | Holy War       10  | combat. 
  | Hero          100  |
  | Mega Phoenix  100  |
  |____________________|
  - This strategy has higher chances of winning compared to other
    strategies found in part II and the Monsters FAQ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now to summon the Omega..

Alpha
First of have the desired party [I would recommend the Guys Team or
Quistis, Squall and Zell]. Now proceed back to the area where you find
the courtyard. Just head for PSP and perform a party change.

Beta
Next have Beta party to examine the bell, and you will see the 
following message:
 "Monsters can be heard roaring far away"
Now head back to PSP at the back and switch Alpha Party. 

Alpha
Just move north and you will find the Omega in the chapel. Make contact
with it and its a BOSS Fight!

Omega Weapon                                | Level 100 HP:    1,058,000
========================================================================
Description: Stronger than the Ultima Weapon. Omega Weapon is the 
             strongest weapon. It is bad luck to run into this monster.
Attacks:     (charge punch), Iron Pillar, Megido Flame, Gravija, LV5
             Death, Ultima, Meteor, Terra Break.
Facts:       Absorbs any elements [hidden]
Draw:        Holy, Flare, Ultima, Meteor
AP gained:   250
Win:         1x Three Stars
Mug:         n/a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy
The Omega is nuts... and here is a brief summary of his array of 
attacks (hmm.. seems nearly impossible to defeat it):
Megido Flame - The Omega rises up in mid-air and followed by a blast at
the ground and the ground arches up and then a 9998 HP damage to all
characters.
Iron Pillar - A light of intensive energy beam appears from the Omega's
core and wipe a member of your team, dealing 9999 HP damage.
Gravija - works like a Demi-All. But it does takes away 3/4 of your
characters' HP. Extremely dangerous if the next turn is Ultima/Meteor.
Magic [Ultima, Meteor]: does damage to the entire party with around 2000
HP to each character.
LV5 Death - Summons a Devil that rises from the ground and attacks all
allies causing instant death. It's game over if your characters are at
levels that are multiple of 5. Just have 100x Death junctioned ST-Def-J.
Terra Break - Omega leaps into mid-air and fire beams of energy balls [
like Akuma's Zankouken] and does multiple damage to the party.

In fact all can be blocked by the aid of Holy Wars. First at the 
beginning of the battle, have Squall cast Aura on himself. Have Zell
cast Meltdown on the Omega. Irvine/Quistis cast Aura on Zell. 

The Omega should reach its first turn, he will use LV5 Death on the 
entire party. Next have Squall and Zell uses their Limit Breaks whereas
Irvine/Quistis should start to use a Holy War. Now attack! Next the 
Omega will execute its Megido Flame [no damage...]. Just keep on attack
and tap Circle to skips Quistis/Irvine's turn. Aura should start to wear 
off after the Omega has used the Iron Pillar and Terra Break. Just have 
Squall stop and have Zell keep on attack. Next Holy War will start to
wear off. Have Squall cast Aura on himself and Zell keep on using his
Limit Breaks [or use Aura if the Aura wears off]. The Omega should cast 
either Gravija/Meteor/Ultima. Don't bother to heal your characters. 
Instead use another Holy War and just keep on attack! Zell's HP is be 
in critical status. Don't ever use Irvine/ Quistis to attack. Instead 
they should be waiting their turn and decide whether to use a Megalixir 
or Holy War. Just keep on attack. I have managed to called the Omega 
off with 10x Renzoukuken [2 Lion Hearts as finishing blows] and 7x 
Armageddon Fist [5 times with more than 04!] Just keep on the endurance 
and you will be able to finish it off. It took me about 10 minutes to
finish it off.
========================================================================
Beside the prize is a Three Stars, you will also get a Proof of Omega
found under the Information section under the Tutorial Menu.

Now head back to the Save Point where you find the Masters Room. There
you will see the final BOSS of the game. Save your game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy

Here is it folks, the ultimate battle against the final boss of FF8 [no
challenge compared to Safer Sephiroth of FF7]. But remember that this
BOSS can also kick your butt if you don't play well. Ultimecia will pick
three characters randomly to battle her. No necessary to have Squall in
the first battle. The best way is to have all GFs junctioned to the best
three characters. Defeated characters will be taken away from an Angel 
which has a status indicator of "Absorb into time". BTW, you must try
to keep them alive at all costs.

Ultimecia
An easy battle at the beginning. She is pretty weak against Poison. 
Summon Doomtrain as it does a lot of damage. BTW, Demi works well on 
her. She is quite weak, just caste Haste on the entire party [desired
party]. Summon GF Cerberus and cast Regen on all characters. As this
going to be a long fight. She is just like Edea and her Maelstorm can
does intensive damage to all characters along with Slow/Curse status.
Just cast Esuna or use the Treatment command to remove it. After you
have defeated her, she will summon her GF, Griever

 "The most powerful GF..."
 "You.. shall..."
 "..SUFFER!!!"
 "HAHAHA..."

Griever
Despite it called the strongest GF in the game, it is still no 
challenge compared to the Ultima and Omega Weapons. The GF is pretty
smart, fancy casting Triple and does Triple Magic. He could do a 
couple of strong damage such as Gravija, blown a stock of spells in
your inventory. Avoid using GF Brothers/Doomtrain as it is useless.
Just simply use the Meltdown on it and keep on attack. After you have
does damage approximately about 230,000+ HP damage, you will see these
messages:

"The GF's true power.."
"Allow me..."
"To show you...!"
"Griever! Make them bleed"

and this followed by the Shockwave Pulsar which will does approximately
3000+ HP damage to all allies. Fully-cure your members and unleash 
Limit Breaks to finish it off.. and you will eventually see the 
following messages:

 "I shall junction myself..."
 "..Unto Griever!"

Ultimecia "Griever"
A combination of Ultimecia and Griever and this battle is also quite
easy beside the rapid usage of Magic such as Meteor, Ultima. The 
Ultimecia "Griever" can easily does tremendous amount of damage to all
allies with the spells already... But it can do even more along with
the Helix. Each Helix is a magic amplifier and they will increase the
damage dealt by the BOSS by 25%. The BOSS can have only 2x Helix at
all times. Don't bother on them, instead concentrate on the BOSS. It
will typically use all the strongest magic such as Holy, Quake and 
Tornado. If you are bother with the status ailments inflicted by the
BOSS, draw Esuna to fix it. If you have done 75% damage to it, the 
lower portion will start to drop off.. and it will start to use 
physical attacks. The claw swipe could does a massive damage of 1000
to a character with 100 Vit. Just keep up with the endurance and you
will be able to defeat it and this will be followed by the following
sequences:

"Rghaah....."
There you will see a starlight background... Is it over? No.. and
there you will find the true form of Ultimecia:

"I am Ultimecia."
"Time shall compress..."
"... All existence denied."


Ultimecia "True"
This is the final one.. But the BOSS has about 600,000 HP at the level
of 65! But it is nowhere as strong as the Omega. Ultimecia has a high
tendency of "blowing" off the entire stock of magic from a character.
Plus the BOSS will use two of the strongest magic in the game. One is
Ultima (as you could guess..) and other one is Apocalypse which could
does a mean damage of 3000+ to all characters even with 200 Spr stats.
Another powerful attack is Ultimecia's Hell's Judgement, which causes all
HP drop to 1, just like Mobile Type 8's Corona. The only weakness of the
BOSS is it's speed (for my case, I will be able to execute six turns for
1 turn of hers) and defence. It took me two Lion Hearts to finish it off

Now make sure that you have Regen being cast on the entire party. Make
sure that every character's HP are maxed out each time as the Apocalypse
can be really a killer. Just cast Meltdown and cast Aura on Squall and 
have him released the Renzoukuken and you will definitely get a chance
to see his Lion Heart. However there are some precautions. Ultimecia
occasionally will draw Apocalypse from her lower half. But remember 
that you can also draw Apocalypse from her [but she will make sure that
she uses it in the battle]. That's the only chance that you guys will
be able to see the Apocalypse. Try to keep Squall's HP within a 
comfortable range of 4000+ and Aura being cast on him immediately upon
it wears off...

How do you know that the battle is started to close off? You will see
Ultimecia saying off for her last words. The first phrase is 
"Reflect on your..." and this followed by the remaining phrases. 

========================================================================

The battle has finally ended and you will eventually get to the ending
sequence of the game. Just one reminder, don't close off your 
Playstation unless you have saw the word "The End". The CGI is quite
long..... 

Now it's also time for me to say goodbye as this is the end of the
ultimate walkthrough for the English version of FF8. All the possible
routes are being pointed out in the walkthrough and thanks to those 
who have been sending in contributions regarding the game. Thanks a
lot, pals!

Before you contact me, read the following as it will help me in replying
your e-mails. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sending a Question
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This problem has given me much problems from my previous FAQs. I have 
tried my best to answer when possible. Also don't ask me questions which
answers can be found in the FAQ. First of all, read the following before
sending an e-mail to Scott:

- remember to add in "FF8" as your subject in the subject field of
  the e-mail. I have gotten countless e-mails for FF8 and it will help
  me if you classified it with the game titles.
- Next state your question as clearly as possible. If I find the e-mail
  quite hard to understand, I really don't know how to help it. 
- Make sure that words are not in CAPS lock [capital letters], which is
  quite rude, anywhere it doesn't matter to me. But try to avoid it 
  when necessary. Once I got really in a bad mood that I delete all
  e-mails that written in CAPS lock..
- If a question is too frequently asked, I will add it to the FAQ under
  Frequently Asked Questions section.
- Don't expect me to give answers, which can be found in the FAQ. Or it
  will be useless for me to type it out so concisely.
- If you have problems in locating a shop/building, refer to the Maps
  section to settle out those problems.
- BTW, unlike other FAQ writers, I have only one motive and that's to
  help you guys out there by writing the FAQ as concise as possible. [
  in order to give the help that I could]. Well, the FAQ can be proved
  by judging the amount of e-mails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most Frequently Asked Questions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- READ THIS BEFORE SENDING AN E-MAIL. Well, I do accept complaints and
  comments for my FAQs. I would prefer complaints as it allows me to 
  know what changes can be done for the FAQ. If you have a comments, 
  free to drop an e-mail. [it helps to urge me on!]

Q: Can I post the FAQ for your website?
A: Sure as long as the following steps are followed:
   - the disclaimer, including my name and format of the document is not
     altered.
   - The FAQ must remained unchanged.
   - No HTMLizing of document unless permission granted from the author,
     as this is same as editing the document.
   - If you link to GameFAQs, don't link it directly to the FAQ, instead
     link it to the Final Fantasy VIII FAQ database at GameFAQs. 

Q: Where can I get the latest revisions of the FAQ?
A: At GameFAQs. If you want your site to be added to the addresses where
   this FAQ can be gotten, you need to seek permission from me. 

Q: Can you sent me the FAQ?
A: No. Otherwise, I would not have to post it to GameFAQs. Remember that
   this FAQ is a bit too huge to be posted via e-mail. Remember that you
   need to get the latest revisions yourself at GameFAQs. 
   (http://www.gamefaqs.com)

   I know that some guys out there have problems in access to Internet 
   due to personal reasons. But it can't be helped. Anyway, you can 
   always count on a friend to get it for you. I felt quite sorry for
   WebTV users as they can access a maximum of 170 Kbs. Do not worry, I
   will try my best to keep this file small. Or I may spilt my future 
   FAQs into separate FAQs. 

Q: What other FAQs that you have written?
A: Quite a lot, you can check it out at my Contributor page at Game 
   FAQs. 

Q: Why you haven't answered my e-mail?
A: There perhaps may be a few reasons:
   - school [I still got tons of assignments/projects/tests]
   - the answer can be found in the FAQ [if you haven't received the 
     e-mail for two weeks]. I always check my e-mail during weekends/
     holidays, unless I am really busy for that week.
   - Other things may coped up.
   Note that if you can't contact me, feel free to contact other FAQ
   writers for the particular game. But I will be free most of the time
   during school vacations.
   - I am be busying playing the game to uncover more secrets.
   - If the answer can be found in the FAQ, mostly likely I will not
     reply it or it violates some of the rules stated above.

Rumours                                                       ffviii_059
========================================================================
Well, there are a lot of rumours in FF8 and I have received quite a lot
of e-mails regarding to this topic. Here are list of rumours and my 
answers for them. BTW, here is a point of advice: Never, ever believe in
rumours unless it has been proven correct. I have actually try out all
the available methods to get Aeris of FF7 and none of them have been
proven to be true.

Question:
Getting Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy VII
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scott's Reply
A lot of readers have sent me regarding rumours about getting this 
famous Final Fantasy character. Well, there is a lot of outrageous 
rumours which does not make any sense about it. Personally, I don't 
believe quite so, but Squaresoft has make Cloud playable in Final 
Fantasy Tactics, why it would not be possible for FF8? But if Cloud is
said to be avaliable in the game, certainly you can get him through 
gameshark codes. However, no code to unlock Cloud has been discovered.

Solutions/ Conditions to get Cloud

1) Have 15 Gameover at Island closest to Hell and Island closest to 
   Heaven. You are allowed to access through the same memory file.

Well, I have actually try this but it never works! Really, I just load
the file and get into a random battle and just let my characters die!

2) Steal a "????" from the Galbadian Soldiers after the battle against
   BGH251F2 in the Missile Base. Use the item and Cloud will be 
   summoned, doing a cool Omnislash at all enemies just like Odin or
   Gilgamesh.

This rumour I have not yet tried it but most of the chances that it 
will not worked. As all items can be unlocked by using the Item 
Modifier Code, I doubt this would not worked either. BTW, as I normally
picked 10 minutes for the time limit, I don't really have that much 
chance in stealing from those soldiers. I will be rather happy if 
someone test this out for me.

Final verdict: 85% confirmed not true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
Getting Legendary GF Griever
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scott's Reply:
This is actually a misconception of Solomon's Ring which will get GF
Doomtrain, not Squall's Ring. Recently I got a special e-mail from a
reader whom is confused on the number of Squall's Ring. Actually, there
is only three in the game. One is the ring that help by Squall. The 
other one is ring given to Rinoa (which is a duplicate copy of Squall's
Ring) and the last ring is with Ultimecia where she use it summon to 
Griever. According to the Occult Fan III, it states that you need to get
666 items to summon this mystery GF [which is actually Doomtrain]. 
Besides, Griever is one of the final boss of game, so most of the 
chances are that it is false. And there is no known gameshark codes to 
unlock it.

Final verdict: 97% confirmed not true.
