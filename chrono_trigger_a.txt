--  WHAT'S NEW, WHAT'S GONE  --
-------------------------------

Version 1.86 | April 20, 2002
After much controversy on the FAQ board concerning this guide (makes you feel
all warm and fuzzy inside), this FAQ has certainly moved up a notch in terms
of quality and accuracy. So, many thanks to Neill Morgan for helping me bring
out this update. Anyway, while I was making the amendments to this update, I
found that I had not listed all of the bosses in the Bestiary section. So
that problem has been fixed, along with the correct spellings of certain
monsters. Besides those corrections, I've also replaced the approximated HP
values of bosses with their accurate HP since the original sum was calculated
by me on a first playthrough. I hope to finally put this guide to rest unless
anything else comes to light. Thanks for reading.

Version 1.80 | March 21, 2002
After working on this update for about 7 days, I've finally finished refining
this guide. I went through the entire guide and re-wrote many portions of the
walkthrough and other aspects, including the introduction. Everything has
been re-organized. I feel that this update has improved the FAQ immensely;
possibly the best update this guide has had in the 9 months it's been up. I
originally intended to add a Charm List to the guide, but I found  it to be
useless since that information has already been included with the monster
data. Instead of disposing of that document (which I worked on for about 2
hours), I've submitted as a separate file. But  enough about that! Let's talk
more about the guide! Uh, there's nothing more. Thanks for reading.

Version 1.75 | February 7, 2002
Today is my one-year anniversary since the  day my first FAQ had been posted.
To celebrate this momentous event, I decided to update this and a few of my
other FAQs. Yay me! Just corrected a few typos and added the last set of
songs I neglected to list in the Omake section.  I guess I missed it. Anyway,
that's all for now.

Version 1.73 | January 20, 2002
For the fact that could possibly further updates, I thought it'd be a paradox
to mark it as a Final version and keep having updates roll in. Now, my guide
is renewed as Version 1.73. In this update, there's nothing new, except a few
grammar and punctuation corrections.

Final Version | January 17, 2002
I've added a very frequently asked question I've been getting too often. It's
time I settle it in here and hope that you will read the FAQ section before
e-mailing me to ask me the same question. Thanks for tuning in!  There may be
more updates to come! Who knows!

FINAL Version | November 4, 2001
That's it, folks.  This is all the help I can offer.  While this is marked as
the Final Version, I won't hesitate to make quick appearances to correct
stupid mistakes. As always, questions, if any, are still welcome. If you have
any neat info you'd like to contribute, send it my way. I really had fun
writing this FAQ, and I find it to be my best work thus far. I just can't
seem to repeat the effort I put into this particular guide with my other FAQs
I have or will be making in the future. I sincerely thank all those who've e-
mailed me with heart-lifting comments about this guide.  Thank you everyone.

Version 1.5  | October 7, 2001
A small correction by Istanbul and a new question to the FAQ. That's about it
I think.

Version 1.4  | September 13, 2001
Hey there fellow gamers! Thanks for all the helpful e-mails! It was just last
month when I suddenly got a slew of e-mails regarding CT and my FAQ. Now that
the madness is over, I've finally found the time to update the guide, yet
again! And this time, with a new section ("Tab Locations") upon request. Also
new in this version are some reader contributions (Thanks!). That's pretty
much about it...Oh, and  I also cleaned out some errors and appended somewhat
to the walkthrough. Ok, this is Adrenaline signing off! Ciao!

Version 1.25 | August 11, 2001
Nothing really. Just stopped to drop in and fix  some spelling errors as well
as add a little note  to clear up some confusion about Lara's password. Oh,
and I just fixed the ASCII art at the top since someone notified me (Thanks
AJGuitar13 for telling me!) that I spelled "Chrono" incorrectly.

Version 1.2  | August 4, 2001
It's been 2 weeks, I think, since I've updated this sucker. Reading the whole
Thing again last night irked me since I found so many spelling and grammar
errors. I just finished reading (without using a program) the entire guide to
fix up any mix-ups and other stuff.  It's not guaranteed that the FAQ is free
of errors, but major ones have been corrected. I also added some neat info.
people have been sending me. Thanks guys!  On an unrelated note, I've decided
to drop a Spoiler Section for the time being. I may waver back to my original
plan and finish it, but I've gotten lazy. Tell me what you think. Do you need
a Spoiler Section?

Version 1.1  | July 21, 2001
During the course of the day, I've worked my butt off and with the help of
some friends, I've completed the whole guide. Although, I  think I still need
a Norstein Bekkler's Lab compendium, but that's nothing to worry about!
Again, I haven't run the spell check yet, so spelling mistakes are abound! I
need to give my fingers a rest for awhile. Don't expect another update until
about a week! I've also re-arranged some sentences and other stuff.

Version 1.0  | July 19, 2001
Everything is finished,  but I will play the game several times just to patch
up any holes and make affirmations.  Although, the spoiler section is still
under construction since I have used  my  valued Chrono Trigger time taking
notes for the rest of  the guide.  I also need to get all the endings so I
could share my unreliable brain power with you.  This is the initial release
of the FAQ,  so please don't make a fuss about it until the next update. I
haven't run the  spell check yet,  so spelling mistakes and possible grammar
errors are abound. Love and Peace!

A NOTE ABOUT THE FFC COLLECTION:
---------------------------------

There are possible defects in some  Final Fantasy Chronicle packages. Accord-
ing to a reliable source, the first batch of FFC packages that were shipped
do contain defective discs of both games. However, the chances of this
happening to you are 1 of 10. If you happen to be that unlucky person, I feel
for you, man. Actually, you should try it on all your Playstations (Ie PSOne,
PS2, etc).  Some, according to a few people, work on  PS2's while others work
on the PSOne, and for others, it doesn't work.  Period. As for me, both discs
work fine on both my  PSX and PS2. I'm just  that cool.  But uh, this message
was supposed to remind you to always keep your receipt...or something.


Solid Examples as such:
------------------------

*SPOILER WARNING*

WHEN:
After first trip to the end of time.  After returning to 1000 AD to
investigate and  was referred to  Magus  as the CREATOR of Lavos.  I ventured
through Guardia's Castle and  learned that Tata (false Hero) was  looking for
the Masamune.  Before going to Zenan Bridge, I visited and defeated Lavos.

ENDING:
When I defeated Lavos, I saw the "Legendary Hero Ending". Robo and Atropos is
in NeoLeene Square, re-enacting Crono's and Marle's fateful first encounter.
Then you see Tata at Guardia's Castle (600 AD – Middle Ages) and  goes off to
Magus's Lair.

HERE'S THE BUG I ENCOUNTERED:
After going through the PlayStation Version Credits and was taken to the Save
System File screen, I noticed that it still read as "Ending #05 Good Night(Nu
trying to sleep and bothered by a Tap'ole)."

For a secondary confirmation, I tried saving the system file only to find
that it did save as the Ending #05 Data.

Thanks to Rex Fabros for this bug.

 Introduction to this Guide
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This Chrono Trigger guide serves as the ultimate Chrono Trigger resource that
combines quality content and an innovative text formatting for ease of
navigation. Each event written in this guide does contain story spoilers. The
intent was not to plant even an iota of spoilers within the walkthrough.
However, as dumb as this author is, she may have let a few (minor, if not
fairly major) slip by without her knowing it. As with most other guides, this
FAQ strives to act as the near perfect reference for when you get stuck or
just want to pick up all the goodies you've missed on your first playthrough.

This isn't (hopefully) a strict  walkthrough in the sense of a "run right and
run some more" set of instructions. You will have a blast, experiencing the
sensation of this epic adventure on your own, rather than letting me drone on
and on about meaningless stuff. My purpose here is to just show you the path,
and you're on your own from there  until you come across  another fork in the
road (Pick it up ^_^). Take advice only when you are totally stumped.

With the help of this guide, you should be able to finish Chrono Trigger in a
good 20 to 25 hours of gameplay. Unless, you really enjoy exploring, possibly
even 40 hours.  However, if you play too much at once, there is a possibility
you might get brain cancer. :)  So, it's very wise to play a little at a time
to fully digest the story of Chrono Trigger.

For your convenience and greater precision, I have diligently listed the area
contents--as in what monsters, items and equipment you are to find in each.
I've also added a shop list at the end of each town visited. And remember, I
make no promises as to the degree of spoilers thrown at you against your
will.  Finally, I hope you all find my work helpful; the only benefactor here
is my miserable lack of life. Pip, pip.


 Introduction to this Game
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We'd have to admit, the announcement of a Final Fantasy Chronicles due out in
the summer was a bit sudden, but why would we want to complain? It's Chrono
Trigger and Final Fantasy IV (II in the US) we're talking about! Sure, it may
just very well be another mediocre-adjusted, synthesized game.  However, from
past experiences  with Chrono Trigger,  it has been suspected that there have
been no significant changes we can't revere. This duplicated version has just
been revamped with anime sequences portraying the flow of the fabulous story.
Although  an exact replica of the original game, RPG players like DaLadiesMan
and I have been  eagerly awaiting for this title  to finally port over to the
Playstation. Now, that the boys at Square Japan have gotten over their
monopolization of the PSX Chrono Trigger, they have finally plucked up enough
sense to localize it. They are doing something right for once!

The Playstation  version of Chrono Trigger was released in Japan just in time
before the Christmas shopping frenzy (November 2, 1999). It's been that long,
already. Now, it's been two years and finally, fortunate oversea dwellers can
finally,  and once again, join  an unforgettable adventure with Crono, Marle,
Lucca and the gang through a world of turmoil and antagonism.

Chrono Trigger involves story themes of time travel, whereas Chrono Cross was
comprised of dimension hopping. It's a frantic adventure to stop the
inevitable apocalypse from emerging onto the surface world. You will meet new
allies that range from prehistoric times to a futuristic period that depicted
the aftermath of the conflagration.  It's up to Crono and co. to save the day
and prevent this atrocity from happening.  Can they really change the fate of
the world? We're about to find out.

This section introduces the player to the style and unique game play features
of Chrono Trigger.  It is up  to you whether you want to master the system or
not before overcoming the game. I will provide you with concise tutorials
that focus on the main themes of the game. These topics are designed to get
you over that learning curve more quickly--none too brain-exhausting.  If you
have never played a RPG before, never fear; the terminology is simple, and
you are statistically likely to adapt to the gist of things quickly,
especially since you're on  the web and happened  upon this page by searching
for "I SUCK AT CHRONO TRIGGER". Enough yappin', get crackin'!

 DEVELOPING YOUR PARTY'S STRENGTH
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After many battles with enemies, you should notice that your party receives a
certain amount of experience points (EXP.), tech points (TP), and gold (G).
These numbers are not meaningless, for they help augment the current stats if
it reaches the required total amount of points. Experience points are used to
increase the level of a character. When the character reaches the next level,
his stats, including strength, defense, speed, etc. will increase
systematically. After every time he moves up a level, the amount of required
points will  increase as well, making it more difficult to level up.  That is
the true essence of a RPG.

The key to making your  characters more powerful is to fight and defeat _all_
the enemies in the area. You may not know this, but the game's system is set
out this way. There is a fixed amount of enemies in each dungeon/area that
can help you level up by the time  you complete a dungeon.  Although monsters
re-spawn after re-entering the area again, it's still a system to consider.


 FINDING HIDDEN/OBVIOUS ITEMS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Keep a sharp eye out for any  suspicious-looking objects. If you find  it out
of place, like a mango lodged in a rice field, most of time, it's a
camouflaged chest. There are, however, some chests that take a little
perseverance to access, although many of them can be retrieved at later parts
of the game. These chests can contain  various items  such as armor, weapons,
accessories, and important or rare  items. The chests that  contain rare gems
are usually partially hidden or difficult to access.

In a New Game+, all the treasure chests  you've already pillaged  will return
to their spots and will be ripe for the picking once again. It's good to have
duplicates of one or more items. On a second playthrough, you may be able to
find chests you've never thought possible. It's important to keep a sharp eye
out while exploring towns and dungeons, as these places are riddled with many
hearty treasures.


 THE COMBAT SYSTEM
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The most important aspect of the entire game (well, besides the story) is the
combat system. Without it, the game can become a little monotonous. When the
lead character (Crono) comes in contact with the visible monsters, the game
switches on the battle engine, in which each  character  draws his weapon and
prepares himself for a battle.

Although you may be familiar with the basic RPG battle system, Chrono Trigger
features a unique style of fighting. It requires careful balancing of
attacks, tech skills, healing and defense. It's imperative that you don't
just engage in a battle uninitiated. First, there is the layout of the
command menu.  Allow me to  provide you with a  visual aid to help you better
understand it.

  _____________________________ ___________________________________________
 |  A.     |         |         |         B.  HP     MP          C.         |
 |-> Att.  |-> Att.  |-> Att.  |  Bob       999  : 99  (================)  |
 |   Comb  |   Comb. |   Comb. |  Bobby     999  : 99  (================)  |
 |   Item  |   Item  |   Item  |  George    999  : 99  (================)  |
 |_________|_________|_________|___________________________________________|


That's your basic  command alignment.  At the  start of the fight, characters
will not stand in one line like Final Fantasy. Instead, the characters will
stand in positions that end up encompassing the opposing party unless
ambushed.  Also, Chrono Trigger doesn't exhibit a cheap "whack fest", wherein
they deliver a nasty poke to their foe and return. There's a unique, cartoon-
ish motif to it.

So what do the letters mean? I'm getting to that part.

        "A" : When the active time bar fills, the character's bar that
                  filled up will be given a chance to act. While you
                  decide what you want him to do, that character will
                  remain stationary until the player has confirmed a
                  command.

        "B" : Those numbers indicate the remaining amount of Hit
                  Points and Magic Points each character has. The names
                  above are ones I made up; don't be fooled by them.

        "C" : That is the active time bar. Depending upon how fast the
                  character is, the bar can fill up slowly or in an
                  instant. The character will remain inactive until the
                  the bar is fully filled.


While you can be  content with just using physical attacks, the developers of
this game purposely set up a system to allow  you to use magic known as techs
and these neat powerful attacks called tech skills. Each character has innate
abilities that become available to you  as that character levels up or when a
special situation arises and grants him his powers.


 DUAL/TRIPLE TECHS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After reaching a certain power level, a character  can learn new tech skills.
Tech skills are powerful magic attacks that utilize the power hidden within
each character. The point? As each character gains tech skill after tech
skill, two required tech skills of two specific characters can be defined.
For example, Crono's Cyclone must be in synthesis with Frog's Slurp Cut to
perform the X-Strike, an attack that leaves the trail of a X. This tech skill
is unique to Crono and Frog only. Both must participate in battle in order
for it to be properly executed. Sounds confusing, doesn't it?  It's not. It's
only because I made it sound that way.

To perform these dual techs, you must wait  until the required characters are
all active and ready to strike. The command Comb. replaces Tech; this is when
you know a dual tech is now available.

Not just dual techs, there's also the Triple tech--a system that derives from
dual techs. The only difference is that, as its name implies, three
characters are needed to perform the triple tech properly.  There are many
possible combinations to try with the seven characters. You know, trial and
error. Or if you want to show off as the Chrono Trigger expert on your block,
you can steal a look at the chart  I've provided and say  you discovered them
on your own, you cheap bastard.


 STATUS EFFECTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

While playing through the game, you have probably encountered certain enemies
that have the ability to inflict various status effects that pose a dangerous
threat to your party. The effects of these status ailments often hamper or
outright block your character's abilities to fight to their full potential.
Enemies will try to react intelligently to status ailments, either on you or
on themselves. Fortunately, there's a panacea to every one of these ailments.

Enemies will view the maintaining of these status ailments as a priority, and
there are certain status effects (ones that the enemy has cast upon itself,
specifically) you  cannot undo. Regardless, all  status ailments  will vanish
when the battle ends.

Unlike Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger  offers a fixed  set of party members you
can recruit, which is 7, respectfully.  However, don't let the number deceive
you. Their personalities and backgrounds aren't nearly as insipid. They
actually portray more  emotional countenance than the myriad of characters in
Chrono Cross.


Crono
------

He seems to look young enough to  wield a wooden sword and old enough to take
on an adventure only you and he will experience together, along side of his
other companions. The worldwide quest looks too big of a job for little Crono
to perceive by himself. Never fear, with his affable manner, Crono can be
befriended easily. Sure enough, he meets a couple of companions that are
willing to throw their lives away  just to be travel  buddies and to save the
fate of mankind from Lavos. Although his dialogue is never shown in the game,
his buddies interact with him as though he had said something. This audacious
warrior, always thirsting for adventure is about to have a taste of his fill.
An all-around good fighter.

Lucca
------

Lucca and Crono  have  been friends  for who knows how long, and they are not
about to let some flaw in her Time machine invention come between them. Being
the daughter of an ill-struck mother and a  renowned goofball inventor, Lucca
has devoted herself to the study of science and technology. Her brilliant
mind will come in handy many times to get the party out of sticky situations.
Although she's not the best of a fighter, her fire magic is effective against
some bosses and helps conjure some of the best Dual Techs in the game. Yowza!

Marle
------

Not just a blonde chick, but THE blonde chick. She is the daughter of a royal
family. She happened upon Crono at the Millennial Fair, the same day she had
snuck out of the castle. There is some uncanny connection with her pendant
and the Teleporter that had transported her elsewhere, and later Crono, to a
world that had existed hundreds of years ago. Why was she sent there? Why
does she look like Bulma?*  All valid questions. But enough with them, I
forgot to mention a few of her attributes: Well, she's pretty proficient with
her bow, but she is reserved for the title, "magic user". Preferably, use her
magic whenever you need to pry yourself out of a jam. The Ice element is also
considered as Water.

* : Yes, I know she looks like Bulma because the character creations were by
    the famous Akira Toriyama of the Dragonball series. Stop telling me!

Frog
-----

The former benevolent knight, now a gallant, archaic-tongue speaking frogman.
Literally. He's a life-size talking frog. Nothing strange there, right? Of
course not. Apparently, he was transformed into a "human frog" by a powerful,
notorious magician known as Magus. At first, he's apathetic to joining Crono
on his quest, but finally sees through Crono's true intentions and decides to
join him under the name of Cyrus!  He's a great ally to have and has powerful
attacks.  He also does the fabulous X-Strike double tech with Crono, which is
easily one of the most useful double techs in the game.

Robo
-----

There are many oddities we'll never understand in this game. What now? Nothin
but a talking robot that has been recovered from beyond damage, thanks to our
Lucca. Founded by Lucca in the year 2300 AD, Robo is indebted to Lucca for
repairing his circuitry. He joins the party just for the heck of it. Oh, and
because Lucca is a nice lady. His initial objective was to annihilate all
humans and leave no remnants of them, but while repairing Robo, Lucca managed
to erase that horrific mission from his database.  Now, Robo is a good-willed
robot that's willing to help those in need. He can be a good fighter once you
equip him with stronger weapons.  Not the most  reliable character, but he is
one of the few characters that comes equipped with Shadow-based abilities.

Ayla
-----

A mysterious woman who rescued the party  from a horde of vicious reptiles at
their first confrontation at Mystic Mountain in the year B.C. 65,000,000. She
communicates with them by putting a few words together, forming a barely
coherent sentence, but still comprehensible. She hails from Ioka Village--one
of the two existing villages in this time period. Her village, along with the
neighboring village is currently at war with an advanced civilization of
humanoid dinosaurs called Reptites. While Ayla is strong, she, unfortunately,
wields no weapons, but rather, she  packs quite a punch with those iron fists
o' hers. As she and the party develops, she attains more powerful fists.
Shortly after  their first meeting, Ayla  invites the flustered  party to her
village, where the troubles had no beginning and no end.

Magus
------

In the beginning, Magus only goads and taunts you with his magic, and evolves
into a formidable opponent for your party to handle. However, it turns out
that he is actually trying to exact his revenge on Lavos, under the pretense
of destroying humanity in order to form a pact with the  Mystic Race (who are
in conflict with the human race). He comes packed with incredibly powerful
magic attacks and is probably the strongest character in the game, if not the
single most useful character.

It seems that a lot of people have trouble using certain Triple Techs.  There
are two main conditions that are needed to be met in order to muster up
specific triple techs.  First, you need the  individual tech skills from each
of the three characters that are required to enact the triple tech. In most
cases, that's enough to execute the triple tech skill. However, in special
circumstances, the aid of an unique rock to invoke the skill is necessary.
Therefore, you need _both_ the individual tech skills _and_ the rock equipped
on one of the characters.

To clear up  some  confusion, I'm  going to  list the  tech  skills  that are
required from each character for each triple tech.

                           |  IV.  Walkthrough  |

Just a few notes before you play:

* This walkthrough's purpose  is to not guide you strictly, step by step at
every potential "dangerous" zone, but to light your path. You will find that
I have not gone into too much detail trying to explain how to get any one
item, unless it takes some doing.  If the item is just there, overt to view,
and you miss it, you're a moron and you shouldn't even be playing this game.
Go home.

* The names of the attacks I've provided with each boss strategy are names I
have made up based on the context of the attack. Most attacks are not named,
therefore, a lot of the names are inane, made-up attacks by me. You're
welcome.

* The degree of spoilers in this guide have been compressed to my ability. I
did summarize minor events of the story, so it's safe to read the whole FAQ
if you wish.  Although I may have been unable to contain myself and let the
spoilers loose. Needless to say, just be cautious.

* If this is your first time reading the FAQ and you're looking for something
specific, you'll find that it is rather difficult to do that since I've not
specified the location, era, etc. Instead, they're substituted by catchy (or
sort-of catchy) titles.

* If you feel the need to use  this walkthrough, please stick with this same
walkthrough the whole game through. If you like "FAQ-hopping" you'll find it
difficult to follow up where you've left off with this guide.

* Please remember that I'm not a perfectionist.  Thus, I probably don't have
_every_ single item you can get in each area. So, I ask you as the readers
to help my helpless soul. You can send just about anything that you think is
_helpful_.

* A tip for the wise. Since this game is based on time traveling. What you do
in the past _does_ affect the future. Therefore, if you see a chest, pick it
up in the future, and come back to the past–-the item is still there!
However, this doesn't work for everything. The treasures from the past,
present and future differ somewhat.  And some areas aren't accessible in some
time periods.

* Finally, enjoy your experience at an AdrenalineSL walkthrough. Have a nice
day, son.


      ---------------------------------------------------------------


Before our story unfolds, the game offers two options: Active or Wait.  Well,
what on earth does that mean? Those two options pertain to what type of
combat you would like. Still lost? Then let's discuss the difference between
the two.  Active is  a system which allows the player to battle in real-time
mode, meaning, that it's not turn-based.  The enemies will not sit and allow
you to take eons to select a command. They will attack no matter what. A
perfect example would be Final Fantasy's ATB battle system. You'd have to be
quick with your choices or you're toast.

Whereas, the Wait combat  system allows you to exchange attacks with current
adversaries. This is recommended for tyros and first-timers at this game.
That way, you won't be pressured  to make a choice to attack.  Whatever your
choice, it won't affect the game, except the  type of combat system you will
undergo.

WAKE UP, SLEEPYHEAD!
Our quest begins at  Crono's house, where we see him sleeping soundly in bed.
His mom approaches him and tells him to wake up.  Crono sleepily and
reluctantly gets out of bed and heads downstairs. Downstairs, Crono's mother
will have forgotten your inventor friend's name. Here, you'll be asked to
name her. Once the conversation  has ended, speak to your mother for a second
time to receive your weekly allowance--[200G].

Time to head out and have fun at the fair.  Travel north from your house to
reach the Millennial Fair.

FUN AT THE FAIR
From the entrance, you can already see a load of stands and funhouses for you
to choose from. The carnival is bustling with people. You can sense warmth in
the atmosphere as the place fills with sporadic laughter of children. The
people here won't give you the time of day, so don't bother. Unless you speak
with the vendors selling weapons and other money-hungry people, there's no
one else to talk to. Among the activities, you have a variety to choose from.
Here's a quick chart of what there is to do to digress from the story.

Now that you've got a fill of fun, it's time to revert to the story. Ok, from
here on out, you need to find and trigger  events before the subsequent event
with Lucca will ensue. So let's meet our first additional party member.

MEETING UPON FATE
Head to the top of Leene's Square to find a young girl wandering around.  You
can deliberately run into her, or vice versa. When you and the girl collide,
she loses her pendant and frantically searches for it. Regain control of the
chap, Crono, and bring the pendant to her.  You're supposed to give it back,
you thief! You now have a chance to name her something inane, but her default
is Marle.

Listen up, now.  The actions you perform from here are essential to the later
repercussions. Screw up and you die (Well, not really, but it does have the
effect to grasp your attention, eh?). The point is to try and be the best lil
samaritan you can be by:

A. Leading the stray cat from the west  portion of the market to the opposite
   side and returning it to its owner.
B. Challenging Gato to a quick duel and win.
C. Speaking with Melchior, the weapons store owner. He asks if you're willing
   to sell Marle's pendant.  Refuse his offer.
D. Never taking the luncheon from  the table, although it's very  enticing to
   do so.  You will be considered a thief  if you do that and you  don't want
   that status, do you?

Follow my advice and you should be fine for the time being. It's time to meet
with Lucca and see what the hooey is all about. Speak with the girl resting
near the water fountain. The stairs to Lucca's location are now accessible.
When Marle  goes off to buy candy, be a  patient gentleman  until  she's done
(See: Don't move a muscle!).

FUN GONE WRONG
At the top, witness the pyrotechnic  display Lucca  and her  father entertain
the crowd with. Introducing their newest invention, the Teleporter! By
dreadful misfortune, Crono must act as her first victim, er...I mean
volunteer. Marle has enough brains to observe from afar. Lucca takes Crono
and positions him on the left pod.  After some bizarre rituals from the Lucca
family team, Crono disappears and re-appears  on the opposite pod. Of course,
the crowd is utterly baffled  by this performance.  Is it a hoax?  Now, Marle
wants to try it out!


   ________NOTE
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | You can actually skip Crono's performance by speaking with Marle before  |

Everything is flowing along swell until a huge dimensional opening splits the
space in two, sucking Marle into it. A hush falls over the crowd and Crono is
the first to react.  It seems that Marle's pendant distorted the functions of
the teleporter.  As soon as Crono steps onto the pod, Lucca goes berserk, but
eventually gives in. She tells you to wait for her until she figures out
exactly what went wrong.  Crono gets drawn into the same wormhole and
disappears from  Leene's Square. And thus, a whole  new adventure awaits. Can
you contravene with time?

to use Tonics sparingly. You can avoid the last

you quietly hug the south border of the screen and  slip through to the exit.
You might want to equip that PowerGlove you found on Crono.

Things are well...different, even the overworld theme. Something's fishy. You
can stop by the Residence areas and Truce Inn if you wish to stock up on
items. That is, if you have any money. However, your destination is the green
bushy area before the conspicuous castle further west called Guardia Forest.

Navigating through Guardia forest  is simple, but you will encounter a couple
of hostile battles along the way, but nothing you can't handle at this point.
Investigate the suspicious rustling leaves for a pig-like creature to pop out
and drop a [SHELTER]. You can re-enter and do this as many times as you'd
like. Now, you don't have to waste 150G on Shelter anymore! :)  In the
southeastern area of the  forest are two  glowing dots, inspect the upper one
to receive a [POWER TAB]. To the north is the pathway to the castle.

BLAST TO THE PAST
Inside, two soldiers stop you and ask your name. They mention your hair look-
ing a bit outlandish. After scoffing at you for your strange appearance, the
queen comes to your aid and orders them to let you through. Somehow she looks
vaguely familiar. There is a place for you to recover your health to the left
of the room.

The Chancellor seems quite suspicious of you and snubs you  regardless of the
king's friendly approach. The left tower leads to the guest's resting
quarters. There's a chest containing a [BRONZE MAIL] there. Along the way,
there is [100G] inside a chest. The right tower is where you should be
heading.  Grab the [TONIC] from the chest and proceed to the top to  meet the
queen.

Approach the Queen and she'll dismiss her servants.  After the  shocking news
and odd event, regain control of the hero and empty the chest for an [ETHER].
Discretely leave her room and return the way you came. At the bottom, Lucca
and you reunite and discuss the strange occurrences that are happening.  She
comes up with the theory that you  are in the primeval  castle that resembles
the one in your time. To conclude her theory, you must find the real queen or
Marle will cease to exist in the present time (1000 AD). Leave the castle and
head towards the Cathedral.

WHERE IS THE QUEEN?
Ignore the door in front of  you at the  start of the entrance; head along to
the left. In the room, at the top of the left set of stairs, check the clock
for the secret [NAGA-ETTE BROMIDE]. Upon doing so, you are attacked by 3
Hench. The Naga-Ette Bromide  has no use now, but  it can be traded later on,
at the Dorino Village for a Magic Tab. Equip any new armor, weapons,
accessories you can when you have the chance.  To have even a small advantage
over your enemies is better than nothing. On the opposite side of the room,
discover the horrifying truth about monsters disguising themselves as humans.

In one of the rooms, don't be deceived  by their horrid impersonations of the
king, Queen Leene, and a soldier.  They will try to  lure you into their trap
with the pretense of acting as if everything is fine. In that same room,
there is a partially hidden room to your right; it leads to two very nice
prizes. Don't miss out.

The next area contains a save point. Slide down  the right set of  stairs and
hit the skull switch to lower the spikes in the center room. Dispose of the
third-class enemies and play the organ to  again to open, yet another, secret
passage along the northern wall.

Meet some stiff resistance in the next room and finally, save at the point to
avoid any unnecessary backtracking. Before going in, Crono and Frog must be
able to perform their X-Strike dual tech, and Crono should have the Steel
Saber equipped on him.  On the other side of the door is the real queen and a
political imposter.


BOSS: YAKRA                                                        HP: 920
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: NeedleThrust                                      Gained:  50 EXP
                                                                     5 TP
                                                                   600 G

At the start of the fight, alternate using the dual tech, Fire Whirl, with
Lucca and the X-Strike with Frog. Use Ethers when necessary. When Crono is
executing a dual tech with one character, have the other attack normally. The
boss counters with an attack that damages all characters. He's a pain in the
butt, but easy enough to finish off without too much effort.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Following the battle, the queen thanks  you and waits for you by the door. In
the left chest is the Chancellor all tied up. He's fine, so don't worry about
him. :) If you leave him in the chest, he'll magically pop out and chase
after you as the party  turns to leave. Collect the [MID ETHER] and return to
the castle.

Back at the  castle, peace has been restored and the people within the castle
are content. Frog blames himself for allowing Queen Leene to be kidnapped.
And because he had failed to protect her, he's decided to leave for good. The
embarrassment and shame is too much for him to retain.

Return to the throne room and speak with Queen Leene.  Speaking of the queen,
where's the princess?  I'm speaking of  Marle, of course. Your best bet is to
go back to the queen's room, where she had first disappeared.  When you reach
her room, Marle will once again, make her appearance and not remember a thing
that has happened to her. The choices you are given here have not yet been
confirmed whether or not they affect the  outcome of the story.  Chances are,
they don't. With the party reunited, it's time to go home.

now that Princess Nadia has come home safely. But    |  EQUIPMENT           |
unfortunately for Crono, he does not receive such    |  BronzeMail          |
an vivacious greeting. Instead, the Chancellor       |  Lode Sword          |
orders the soldiers to detain him. Marle demands     |______________________|
her soldiers and the Chancellor to stop this at
once, but they yield no compliance. The Chancellor
censures Crono for abducting Princess Nadia and orders
him to be kept in a holding cell.

Later on, a hearing will be  held to determine  whether  the verdict (you) is
guilty of um, royal abduction or not. The number of people that will be your
proponents or opponents are dependent upon the actions that took place in
Leene's Square--before your party's little journey to save Marle. If you have
followed what I've said earlier, then you should get by. However, from adding
up the factors that can  cause members of the  jury to go against you, I have
summed it up to this:

           Crono's guilty if he:
                 - Deliberately bumped into Marle
                 - Took the pendant before checking on Marle
                 - Stole the lunch from the elderly man
                 - Tried to persuade Marle into selling her pendant
                 - Didn't return the kitty to the little girl
                 - Didn't wait for Marle to finish buying candy

           Crono's innocent if he:
                 - Did the opposite of the all the above

However, if you've  followed what  I have said in Leene's Square, just answer
the Chancellor in this order: "I did." and "No, not at all."  This should  be
more than enough to have 5 jury members on your side.

After the witnesses have told  their amusing stories  depending upon what you
did, seven jury members will come out one by one and decide whether or not
Crono is guilty.  The predominant side will win in your favor.  Regardless of
whether you were innocent or guilty, the soldiers will be ordered to take you
away to  confinement. Although the  repercussion is  the same, you do benefit
from being innocent. Accompanying you in  your cell are  6 [ETHERS], given to
you by sympathizers. You also  have about 3 days left to cherish the sun, the
moon and the stars.


   _______NOTE

 | There are two dilemmas for you to choose from. One being, you break out  |

 | saves you herself. However, the choices, to my knowledge, won't affect   |
 | the story. Go to JAIL BREAK if you decided to bail out on your own, or   |
 | go to LUCCA, OUR SAVIOR, if Lucca helped your pathetic little self.      |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


JAIL BREAK
When you've regain consciousness, bang on the  cell door three times to annoy
the guard. He comes in and shuts your pie hole.  Before he gets a chance to
leave the cell, quickly sneak up behind him and bonk him in the head.  Now go
out to meet an armed Guard. Quickly dispose of him and leave. You'd want to
go to the opposite tower before dealing with the Blue Shields blocking access
to the other areas.

Take the  left set of right stairs to avoid an  unnecessary battle.  As Crono
crosses the bridge to the other side, two guards accost him from both
directions. Stupid cowards. Continue into the interior of the next tower and
infiltrate it by sneaking up on guards and knocking them unconscious. If they
see you, you'll have to battle them. Examine guards you've felled for some
items.  Help the pitiful man from the guillotine and plunder the chests along
the way.

Beat the second set of Blue Shields.  Head up the left stairs and through the
hole in the wall. Climb down the tower and crawl into any openings to find
treasures. There is a hole in one of the cells. Investigate and jump in to
come to two chests. One contains the most powerful weapon you can get at this
point, the [LODE SWORD], and the other features [1500G].

Find your way to the  supervisor's room and  scare him off, only to  find him
being zapped silly by one of Lucca's crazy guns. Yay, Lucca is here to save
you! Worship her, you fool! Read the top secret document on the floor to
learn about the upcoming boss' weaknesses.  Inspect the unconscious  body of
our lovely  superintendent to gank 5 [MID TONICS] from him. We need them more
than he does.

OR...

LUCCA, OUR SAVIOR
Wait patiently for  the 3 days to pass by  (go get yourself a cup of coffee).
When your time is up, you will taken to the execution room. Just seconds
Before you're through with begging for your life, Lucca breaks in and zaps
everyone to death (ok, not really, but that's how you'd picture her).  From
this point onward, everything falls in line in accordance to the mainstream
of the story. If you need help, start from the third paragraph in JAIL BREAK.

HI-HO DRAGONTANK
Now is a good time to replenish  your HP before facing this thing.  Make sure
Crono is equipped with the Lode Sword just to boost his attack power for
better results. Equip both Lucca and Crono  with the best equipment you have.
You and your female cohort  will meet your next opponent on the other side of
the bridge...

This bad boy is comprised of a Head, Grinder and the tank itself. If you have
read the manual back in the office, you'll know its weakness. If not, then I
guess it's tough beans for you. But since I'm so nice, I'll just spill it for
the sake of your sanity. From the start of the fight, the head will begin to
heal itself even if no damage has been done to it.  Wipe out the head first
with physical attacks. When the head gets blown off, the rest of the tank
should be susceptible to Fire and Lightning now.  Conveniently, Lucca and our
hero are of these attributes.  For the remainder of the fight, punish it with
Fire Whirl, if you will.
_____________________________________________________________________________


The Chancellor commands  the men to  repair the Dragon  Tank before  it's too
late, even though, it already is too late. Part of the bridge explodes, and
the Chancellor and two other soldiers hold on for dear life, while your party
walks across the imitated bridge. On your way out, the guards won't do a darn
thing; they'll just follow you until Princess Nadia joins you.

In Guardia Forest, the assault team forces you to the eastern edge and barri-
cades any apertures to escape from.  Open the Gate and disappear right before
their eyes for a very comical countenance from our dear Chancellor.

A horrible sight. All the inhabitants of this area   |______________________|
are in emaciated conditions, still struggling to
survive in this desolate land. The first guy you
meet sells decent items including the Mid Tonic. Be
sure to stock up on that before heading out. Replenish the party's health via
the Enertron. When you've restocked on items, it is time to depart.

Once you reach Lab 16, careful to avoid those scurrying rats, as they tend to
steal Tonics from you. You can't get them back once they're stolen. All there
is to do here is to find your way through the debris and empty the chests you
find along the way.  The Shadows you will encounter don't respond to anything
but magic attacks.

In Arris Dome, you'll again find a handful of mendicants who are aspiring for
solid food. When you are asked whether you've come from the west, answer Yes
and everyone is suddenly very interested in you. Their eyes follow your every
movement (scary). Again, there is an Enertron, as well as another merchant
selling the items from Trann Dome, excluding the Mid Tonic. Didn't I tell you
to stock up on Mid Tonics? Save now, then climb down the ladder in the center
of the room.

Weave around the rails and read the memo on the rat statue on your way to the
north.  The alarm sounds and your party is attacked by the guardian of
the...refrigerator?


BOSS: GUARDIAN                             HP: 1200 (Guardian), 200 (Bits)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Amplifire                                         Gained: 300 EXP
         Delta Attack                                                5 TP

This big fella is  hard if you don't do things right.  Immediately after  the
battle commences, concentrate on taking out the Bits first, as they can enact
Delta Attack with the three of them. To avoid any further damage, destroy the
remaining Bit. At this point, the Guardian performs a countdown from 5.  When
it reaches 0, he can revive the Bits. Then the cycle starts over. Just keep
in mind to attack the Guardian, only if the Bits are non-existent. Otherwise,
it'll be hard to keep up your assault while recovering your health. At any
time, other than when the two Bits are gone, should you attempt to attack the
Guardian, it will just counter attack with Amplifire Counterattack.
_____________________________________________________________________________


In the room ahead  is the refrigerator.  Unfortunately, the food has  spoiled
since the fridge had malfunctioned. However, the corpse in the room has a
little something for you to bring back. Inspect the body again to learn about
the rat.

Back at the rails, the once solidified rat statue is alive and perky and it's
itching for you to catch it. Just keep running and don't lag too far behind
by getting "caught" in the cross-sections.  Once it leaves the screen, simply
re-enter the area to try your luck again. When you've caught up to it, it
will disclose the password to the panels in the previous room (L1 + R1 and
X). Use this code on one of the control panels to reveal a bridge  leading to
the door.

Work your way around the enemies and head to the door on the opposite side of
the room. Lucca activates the computer and discloses information about a Gate
at the Proto Dome. Marle ingeniously stumbles onto the horrible truth of this
world.  Whatever's here are the only survivors of Lavos' mass annihilation of
mankind.  It seems that this space-borne creature exercised genocide on
humanity by creating a great conflagration that consumed the lush land. Marle
suggests to the party to take it upon themselves to prevent the world from
ending up this way. On the surface, Doan  gives you the Bike Key and bids you
farewell. On to Proto Dome, but first, we need to stop by Lab 32.

to Proto Dome safely, a highway man known as         |  EQUIPMENT           |
Johnny challenges you to a race. Hit the finish      |  Bolt Sword          |
line and you're free to go. Lose and start over.     |  Robin Bow           |

if you've got the stamina, pass through Lab 32 by    |______________________|
foot. Situated in the highway is a [RACE LOG]. This
is used to record scores when you race with Johnny.

---------------
RACELOG NOTE
If you get the race log from the ruins in the future, you can use it to get
some good items.  Talk to the score keeper to change modes to no nitros, then
race Johnny.  If you score 1300 or more points, you get 5 Mid Ethers.  If you
score 1500 or more points you get a Power Tab.

Note submitted by Cory Clemons

                                  *  *  *
If you get over 2300 points (and that is impossible, unless you stay in front
of him ALL THE TIME), he'll give you 5 Full Ethers! The game says that Johnny
gives 5 Ethers, but that's one big error.

An error that looks like  the one above is that Johnny will say that he gives
you 5 Ethers, but he gives you 5 Mid Tonics instead (this is when you're
having over 1300 points).

There's also a bonus if you get 777 points, but I forgot the prize (and maybe
there's one if you get 999 or 1111?).

The racing will be a LOT easier if you change the perspective (use the L1 and
R1 buttons). Instead of horizontal racing, try it vertically and it will have
amazing effects on your score-counter.  You can also zoom in and out by using
the Triangle and Circle buttons, but that won't make the game easier I think.

Lastly, you'll get a Power Tab if you get over 1300 points. You already noted
this in your FAQ, but you didn't say that it was once (so you can't get it
twice or unlimited).

Thanks to pHOENIX for this info.
----------------

Johnny's abashed by this loss and bows his head in respect for defeating him.
He welcomes you to come by anytime to race again.  With that in mind, you can
leave and finally head towards Proto Dome.

LUCCA DOES IT AGAIN!
Battle the  Buggers that annoy you in  haste.  At the other end is a decrepit
robot covered in rats. You get the first anime sequence when you approach it.
Lucca whips out her trusty screwdriver and gets to work repairing it.  As she
is doing so, Marle discovers that the door to the Gate won't budge. Once
Lucca is done with the repairs, she juices it to give it life. The robot is
rather thankful and speaks in a formal manner. Name him.  Robo offers to help
switch the power back on from the Factory in the north, but someone has to
stay to open the door.  You are torn between choosing Lucca or Marle.  Choose
either, as it doesn't matter too much (although Marle is the  better choice).

AN ACTIVE FACTORY
Fiddle with the computer to instigate a battle with some Acids. They are well
protected against physical attacks. Afterward, hop onto the right elevator.
You arrive in a room with conveyor belts. The room alignment looks confusing.
The first thing you'd want to do is head down to the opening of the lower
conveyor belt that's traveling east; start running  in the opposite direction
and take a breather at the inlets. Repeat this again until you reach the last
inlet.  Avoid the  robots as they go  by or you will be forced  to fight in a
series of unhealthy battles.

Activate the computer and extract the information out of it. It gives you two
Passwords. Copy it down if you're a forgetful person. Now find the crane con-
trol room. Enter the codes after the chime. The crane should  remove the  red
barrels from blocking  your way, opening the path to a  new, accessible room.
Pick up the [BOLT SWORD] and obtain the password "ZABIE", translated as /\,
(_), X, [] in Playstation language from the computer. Return to the entrance
of the factory and hop onto the left elevator. Saving is advisable at this
point.  Defeat the Acids and Alkaline to get the computer to operate. Examine
it and the latch opens, revealing a ladder.

Input the password "ZABIE" into the computer  database to unlock to air-tight
latch on the door to the right. Take a look at the mainframe in the next room
and the alarms goes off. Evacuate immediately. Back at the room full of trash
chutes, 6 robots emerge from them and barricade the exit. Robo recognizes
them as his cohorts and urges them to let his friends through. The robots
scoff at Robo for being defective and forgetting his real mission. As if Robo
were garbage, the robots dump him into the trash chute. Then, they avert
their  attention  back to your party  and ready  themselves to  eliminate all
intruders, meaning you.


BOSS: R-SERIES                                                     HP: 180

Conveniently, they've aligned themselves in two columns of straight lines. It
is great news for you. Being machines that are susceptible to Lightning,
Crono's Cyclone  can almost kill three of these mechanical humanoids at once.
They go down pretty quickly.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Following  the battle, Marle/Lucca goes to the chute  and pulls out Robo. The
two members of the party lug the disheartened robot back to Proto Dome, where
he will be repaired...again.  During the time of his renewal, Marle asks what
he plans to do once he is repaired. Robo doesn't know his answer. When the
repairs have  been finished, Robo's  mind is set; he  decides to  join you on
your worldwide quest to save the world.

A PITSTOP
There was an apparent flaw in the Gate that had the party wind up in a dismal
place as this. Speak with the old man to learn about the End of Time, where
all lost travelers end up. With inductive reasoning, he tells you that there
can only be a party of 3  people traveling through these gates, otherwise, it
will be unstable. Now's your chance to choose which members you'd like to
bring along; the rejected  one stays  here, at the  End of Time, until he/she
is summoned.

The room behind the senile man presents  a pig-like creature that goes by the
name of Spekkio. He imparts some knowledge regarding magic, telling you that
magic had once been an asset everyone had, but all that is gone since man was
abusing his power. He orders you to run around the room 3 times in a
clockwise fashion, starting from the door. Speak to him when you're done, and
if you've done it unerringly, he'll enhance  each party member's ability with
magic. You can use magic now! He asks if you'd like to try out your new toys.
If yes, be prepared for some serious beating.  Use all-magic attacks. Lucca's
Fire and Marle's Ice work well against the little runt.  Although his attacks
can instantly knock off three-quarters of a character's HP, it's very
possible to defeat him. If you can hold off the fort until his defeat, he
will reward you with whatever items that correspond to your character levels.
See chart.

When you feel you've punished  Spekkio enough, leave the  End of Time through
the portal on the right. The glimmering dot on the altar is a shortcut to the
day of Lavos. It is obvious that that's not where you'd want to go right now.

DETRIMENTAL MYSTICS
Your party arrives at Medina Village and pops out of a closet, belonging to a
Mystic couple. Before you leave, the couple warns you of the Mystic's still
vindictive manner toward humans. At the Market, you  are awarded with a bonus
battle against a Hench Omnichrone when you entreat the Hench for items.  Upon
defeat, the Hench succumbs to your murderous glint of anger and reluctantly
sells you items...at _ridiculously_ high prices. Talk about a blow to the ol'
self-esteem. Abstain yourself from buying the Demon Edge, although  it looks
tempting. I believe the  prices they charge  at the Market are at random. You
can find a [MAGIC TAB] and a [SPEED TAB] at the Elder's House.

To retreat to a shop where they actually sell things cheap, head southwest to
Melchior's Hut. He'll gladly sell you items at an _affordable_ price.

The Mystics apparently still hold a grudge against   |  Ether x2            |
Humans even after 400 years; the first ignition of   |  Mid Ether x11       |
resistance is met at the frontlines of the cave.     |=======================
Two low-life Henches to be exact.                    |  EQUIPMENT           |
                                                     |  MagicScarf          |
Monsters here can sustain physical attacks and       |  Taban Vest          |
suffer very little damage from them, although        |______________________|
they'll bite the dust upon being touched by magic.
Almost all the battles here cannot be avoided, except
the very last one with the JinnBottle. Head to the
far left and down. Pave your way towards the turbid waters and wade across to
the save point. You'd better save, as the boss is just ahead. And he's a hard
one too.  You should have the Red Katana equipped on Crono to optimize full
attack power at this point and equip the best defensive armor on the girls if
you have them with you.  It would be better if you have both Marle and  Lucca
in the current party since their Antipode dual tech (if you have it) can
really save the day.

Inside the cave, a mighty beast taunts your party and vows to crush your puny
brains.


BOSS: HECKRAN                                                     HP: 2100
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Cyclone                                           Gained: 250 EXP
         WaterWave                                                  10 TP

He's one helluva tough water merm-thing.  He can  already do some damage with
mere physical attacks, but enforce it with some damaging magic attacks and
you've got one exceptionally tough battle. Try to cast Antipode as many times
as you can. Marle's Ice magic works well, otherwise.  Depend heavily on magic
and pray that he doesn't kill off one of your party members. At some point in
the fight, Heckran goads you to attack him. STOP. Take this opportunity to
revive fallen characters or cure injured ones.  If you attempt to attack him,
he has a disposition to retaliate with Water Wave, a powerful water attack
that damages all party members. The blue guy is fond of his Cyclone and tends
to use it a lot to make you suffer.
_____________________________________________________________________________


The Heckran curses at the party and scoffs at their empty victory. "Magus and
Lavos will whip all yo asses," he says in his dying breath. Suck it up and
continue to the pool. Jump in and it  brings you to Vortex Point near Lucca's
house. Since you're here, you might as well visit her folks. You can receive
a [TABAN VEST] from Lucca's dad, Taban. Quite obvious how he got the name for
it.  Now is also a good time to visit  Fritz' Shop at the Market. He's
forever in your debt and hands you 10 [MID ETHERS] as a deposit (you can only
get this if you have saved Fritz from the guillotine). If you stop by Crono's
house on the way  to Leene's Square, you'll be  treated to a small, frivolous
sequence.

Time to stop fooling around and sidetracking from the story, mates!  Let's go
to Truce Canyon in the year A.D. 600.

HOLD OFF THE TROOPS!
Routinely leave Truce Canyon and check out the repaired bridge.
The soldiers are suffering from exhaustion and hunger. If you don't do
something soon, they're all gonna rot and die! Head straight to Guardia
Castle. Annoy the kitchen chef and his assistants. When you attempt to leave,
he stops you and gives you [JERKY], as well as a [POWER TAB].  With the food,
head back to Zenan Bridge.

At one end is the Knight's Captain; hand over the food rations, also known as
Jerky and he will be eternally grateful. One of his troops comes to report
that Magus' troops are advancing further into the kingdom. Offer to help, and
the captain gives  you a [GOLD HELM] under his  obligation. Equip it on Crono
and get going.

Acquaint yourself with the malignant general, Ozzie.  He sics two dead people
on you (Deceased). Fend them off easily and finish the general with one swipe
of your sword. He'll retreat and sic more undead fiends on your party. Defeat
him again and he retreats to  the far end of the bridge, where he summons the
ultimate undead creature, Zombor, which is  basically a fusion of  five or so
Deceased.

A decent adversary  that will force you to properly utilize your brain cells
in order to defeat him. He is comprised of an upper body and a pelvic bone.
The upper body is immune to Lightning and Fire attacks. Using Lightning-based
or Fire-Based attack heals it. As for the pelvic bone and down, it is immune
to Ice-based attacks. With these hints engraved in stone, use Lightning and
Fire attacks on the pelvic bone area and Ice attacks on the upper abdomen. I
think Crono's physical attacks work well with the Red Katana.  Just beware of
Zombor's attacks, most notably, his Doom, Doom attack.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Travel south to the villages below.  In one of the  Elder's Houses, you barge
in on a conversation. Apparently, the elder is willing to pay Toma, the great
explorer, a copious sum of money to find the rarest of the rare, a Rainbow
Shell. Elsewhere, people are spreading rumors about a boy, by the name of
Tata, who is their supposed legendary hero that will slay the malicious
Magus. There are 2 [MID ETHERS] you can pick up at Fiona's Villa. If you need
to rest up, Porre's Inn is  much more  recommendable  and dare I say, cheaper
than the other inn.

Once you've  robbed everyone of  their  items, it's time to  head towards the
mammoth mountain everyone talks about, the Denadoro Mountains, which is
located just east of Dorino Village.  It's the only towering  mountain in the
area; on it is a small outline of a trail leading  to the summit, seen on the
world map.

Enter to find two seemingly harmless goons. Walk     |  500G                |
past them and the annoying bird rings the bell       |  Mid Ether x4        |
and alarms the goblins. Easy enough here. They       |  Mid Tonic x2        |
die with one swing of Crono's attack, but that       |  600G                |
bird is another story. Anyway, after you've          |  300G                |
dispatched the first squad, continue into the        |  Speed Tab           |
unfamiliar mountain area.                            |  Magic Tab           |

Further ahead, you get a glimpse of the boy who      |=======================
is our supposed legendary hero. Instead of a         |  EQUIPMENT           |
resolute tone you'd expect from a hero, you find     |  MirageHand          |
that the boy is terrified. Although he still         |  GoldHelm            |
attempts to persuade you to go back and runs off.    |  GoldSuit            |
                                                     |  SilverStud          |
You find that the goblins wielding huge mallets      |  SilverErng          |
tend to be helluva lot tougher than they look. The   |______________________|
trick is to use Lucca's Fire magic to disintegrate
its weapon, making it completely helpless. Without its massive
weapon, it loses self-esteem and falls victim to your blade.  They are easily
felled with one swing. There's a  hidden area under the canopy of leaves that
leads to Robo's weapon, the [MIRAGE HAND].


   ________USELESS TRIVIA
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | Most of the battles that take place here are mandatory, although, there  |
 | are some you can avoid since the goblins are taking their afternoon nap. |
 | They won't awake unless you go up to them, or a FreeLancer pelts a rock  |
 | at it, or when a BellBird rings its bell.                                |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


When  you  come to  the  bed  of the  waterfall, notice  that  there  are two
diverging smaller waterfalls near the bottom of the screen. Jump off the left
water flow and you'll land on a ledge. On this  ledge is a [SILVER STUD].
Don't worry about having lost your way. The path you take will lead right
back to the waterfall and the FreeLancers. On the way, don't miss the awesome
[SILVER EARRING], which augments  about 25%  HP to  your current  maximum HP.

On the ledge  overlooking a vista, speak with  the Spekkio-wannabe 5 times to
receive a [MAGIC TAB]. Don't forget to save, you'll need it! Keep a sharp eye
out for the [SPEED TAB], which is resting near the  edge in the next area. It
will glimmer faintly for only a millisecond when you first enter the area.
Dodge the salvo of stones the FreeLancer on the ledge pelts at you. They even
damage you when you're pillaging a chest. Don't overlook the chest hiding
beneath the leaves  in the last area. It contains  the important [GOLD SUIT]!
Tip-toe around the sleeping goblins and retreat into the cave.

Inside the gloomy cave, a boy is having the time  of his life, running around
in circles. Approach the sword plunged deep in the earth, and the boy stops
you.  Amused by your daring attempt to wield the legendary Masamune, he calls
upon his big brother, who looks like just like him, and scoffs at the party
for being foolish humans.  To see whether you are worthy of the honor or not,
they decide to test your abilities.


BOSS: MASA & MUNE                             HP: 1000 (Masa), 1000 (Mune)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: X-Strike                                          Gained: 400 EXP
         Confuse                                                     4 TP

This really isn't considered a boss fight once you know the secret. All there
is to it is to _only_ assault Masa (the one on the left). Why? Because he
won't do a darn thing. If you attack Mune, the two will only counter with the
X-Strike attack. Occasionally, they can sock it to ya, as well as confuse you
with a tornado attack.
_____________________________________________________________________________


That was the test? Apparently not. They are appalled that you have managed to
defeat them. They cite Cyrus for this notable victory. Resorting to their
last line of defense, the twins fuse together to form...A big fat, ugly blob.


BOSS: MASAMUNE                                                    HP: 3600
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Tornado                                           Gained: 500 EXP
         Slash                                                      10 TP
         Pain                                                     1500 G

He's damn tough and I don't care how you look at it.  My recommended party is
Crono, Lucca and Marle. Why? First, Marle has the Aura spell, which can
rejuvenate sluggish party members, and she can also perform a dual tech, Aura
Whirl, with Crono to replenish the entire party's HP. Finally, Marle and
Lucca can perform Antipode together. It does  over 300 damage. Yowza! Proceed
with Crono doing purely physical attacks, and Marle and Lucca casting
Antipode.

Repeat this until either the  party needs to be healed, or when he  starts to
suck in air, like a vacuum. When this happens, he is about to perform his
most powerful attack that can really leave your party crippled.  However, the
secret is to use Crono's Slash to nullify its attack. With the absence of its
Pain attack, nothing can go wrong and you can ensure a victory.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Masa and Mune finally relent and allow  you to proceed to remove the Masamune
from its place. It's broken! A heavy wind picks up and the twins help you out
of the mountain through its peak. Journey to Tata's house and find him
cowering under the stairs. Speak to him to take back the Hero's Medal from
him. He confesses that he was indeed a fake and is sorry. He and his dad then
quarrel over who's wrong and who's the idiot.

REUNION
Now, head to the Cursed Woods and slip through the heavy defense.  You  don't
really need to fight the T'Poles and Gnawers. They're tough. There's also a
[MID TONIC] and a [SHELTER] in the outer woods. Go inside the rustling bushes
to find an underground bunker. Frog lives here. It seems he has secluded
himself from the outside world ever since that incident with Queen Leene.
Even the  Hero's Medal won't soothe  his callous heart. After he moves out of
the way, examine the glimmering dot to find the other half of the Masamune.
Inscribed on the handle is the name "Melchior". There is a [MAGIC SCARF] in a
hidden chest behind the clutter of junk.

Return to A.D. 1000 through the  Medina Village vortex. Visit Melchior in his
hut. He is very surprised that you have the Masamune in your possession. He
offers to fix it, but he needs the necessary material to repair it with. A
DreamStone, which the sword is composed of, is needed to restore the sword to
its former pristine state. However, he drops your hopes saying that the stone
no longer exists and leaves you in the dark.

Warp back to the End of Time and  speak with the old man.  He hints  that the
DreamStone can be found in prehistoric times. The key word being prehistoric.
Hop into the  portal leading to "Mystic Mountain – 65,000,000 BC".  If that's
not prehistoric enough for you, then I don't know what is.

OOHGA-BOOHGA, OOGY-BOOGY-WOO!                        |______________________|
The party arrives in mid-air and plunges to the
bottom of the cliff. At the bottom, they meet, for the first time,
green-scaly dinos called Reptites. Five of them attack the party.
They're fairly hard and especially highly resistant to physical attacks. They
even have a high HP count, although it only takes one blast of magic to
reduce them to scrap.  Once the first batch is disposed of, a second appears.
Your party is outnumbered and there is seemingly no way out. A really cool
anime sequence highlights the appearance of Ayla, your next new ally. She
fells the Reptites with the least difficulty; the party is amazed by her
dynamic, un-human  strength. She fends off a  couple of  Reptites  and kindly
leaves four of them for you to tend to. Apply the same tactics.

Afterward, she introduces  herself as Ayla, and compliments Crono for being a
strong lad. Ayla like strong people! She tells you to visit her village and
runs off at god-like speed, bidding you to follow her. Don't fall behind now!
On the way, you  encounter some hostility with Runners and Kilwalas. They are
easy to deal with so I leave them at your will.

TRIBAL VILLAGE
You can visit any of the four huts. This is the Ioka Village.  Ayla is in the
upper left hut. There's a girl offering sweet water in the bottom right hut
that replenishes the party's HP. The upper right hut is the Trading Hut, but
it's useless right now. Speak to Ayla relaxing in her residence to initiate a
welcome party, made especially for you!

At the mirthful feast, you can dance by speaking to Marle several times until
that option appears. That's always fun to do. When you've done enough, speak
to Ayla on the dais. She challenges you to a fight. Actually, a soup-drinking
contest. Win, and she'll hand over the stone you need. She drinks at a snail-
like pace, so you have more than ample time to gobble up your soup. Crono
gets buzzed and blacks out (ok, not really), but in the morning the party
realizes that the Gate Key is missing.  Sir, report it to Ayla, sir! Find her
in her hut sleeping soundly in bed. You have the honor of waking her up.
Without needing to think twice, she blames it on the Reptites! She
temporarily joins your party and now you have to kick someone out, preferably
Lucca (or Marle/Robo).

You can now visit the Ioka Trading Hut. You can trade items for three of each
of these items: Feather, Petal, Horn and Fang. The guy on the left can tell
you what you can get for each requirement. Here's the list just for quick 'n'
easy reference.

           Ruby Gun    =   Petal and Fang
           Sage Bow    =   Petal and Horn
           Stone Arm   =   Petal and Feather
           Flint Edge  =   Fang and Horn
           Ruby Vest   =   Fang and Feather
           Rock Helm   =   Horn and Feather


Never heard of those items? They are  items that can be obtained by defeating
ridiculously easy monsters at the Hunting Range. They drop a chock full of
these items. Here's a great trick to pile up those primitive items: wait for
the rain to start so that the Nu comes out of hiding. As soon as it stops,
run up to the Nu before it takes refuge from the blistering sun again. He
tells the party that they are strong and coughs out the prizes (3 fangs,
horns, feathers and petals). This neat  trick was by courtesy of Ian Adams. I
suggest you invest the time to collect all the items before continuing on
the quest to retrieve the  Gate Key. They will benefit your  party in battle,
doncha know? Travel south to the Forest Maze when you're ready.

and forces Kino to apologize. It's a pretty uh,      |  Revive x2           |
sentimental scene. Kino directs you to where the     |  Shelter             |
Reptites have gone. Crono and the party are hot in   |  Heal                |

Climb the green vine stalk down and just work your   |=======================

that overlaps the path to the exit, making it hard   |  Ruby Vest           |
to spot it. Just keep a sharp eye out for this, or   |______________________|
you'll miss the exit. Then you'll be a pathetic and
helpless little man.


   ________USELESS TRIVIA
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | The footprints inlaid in the ground indicate that an enemy is nearby. If |
 | you attempt to walk over them, you'll be attacked. But if you try to walk|
 | around them, you can avoid unnecessary battles. There are some that are  |
 | unavoidable, however.                                                    |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


RAID THE NEST!
At the entrance, warm up by fending off a couple of Evilweevils.  They are no
pushovers, as they can do a fair amount of damage to each character. What's
worse is that they only take damage if struck by magic. Physical attacks
work, but not to their potential. Jump in the hole in the ground. The next
few screens just involve a series of battles and jumping in the same holes.
You can't avoid  the battles  here no matter how  hard you try. The MegaSaurs
have a ton of HP, and a few of Crono's Slashes aren't enough.


   ________NOTE
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | There are actually four separate routes that lead to the same place. At  |
 | the entrance, watch the Evilweevils drill holes in four different loca-  |
 | tions. Drop down any of the ones you haven't gone through yet. At each   |
 | route, there are different treasures, including an [ELIXIR].             |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


Once you reach the large  cavern, prepare yourself for  those nasty Reptites.
You will find a couple of them scurrying about. Some of the unmoving Reptites
are blocking your view to treasure chests.  The chests contain a [FULL ETHER]
and a [ROCK HELM]. Don't miss those two items!

In the next area, you'd you have to slog through 3 battles to get to the last
area. But first, take a detour to the left. At the entrance, jump down the
holes you haven't gone to yet. The party drops to another part of the cave,
where you meet some hostile monsters guarding their stash. Defeat them to get
the prizes and leave safely.

Back at the previous area, dispatch the  squad  with the MegaSaur and the two
Reptites for a save  point to appear. Save now, and if you don't already have
Marle in your party, now's a good time to insert her in there.  You will need
her fierce magic. Don't forget to equip everyone with a Ruby Vest. Venture
deeper into the cave to meet Azala, the leader of the Reptite pack. He thinks
Crono and the party are apes with advanced technology. When you approach him,
he demands to know what this strange contraption does and how. He is
referring to the Gate Key, of course. Either answer will net you a fight with
Nizbel, his strongest henchman.


BOSS: NIZBEL                                                      HP: 4200
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Electrocution Energy                              Gained: 500 EXP
                                                                    10 TP
                                                                     0 G

This guy is a cinch once you know what's  keeping his body so immune to every
type of attack. First, zap him with Crono's  Lightning. Doing this will shock
him and lower his defense dramatically. Now you can do up to 200 damage to
the big guy. If you have Marle, the Ice Sword works wonders against the
overgrown uh, big thing. When he uses Electrocution Energy, you must heal
immediately regardless of how daring you are (unless you're playing new
game+). It withers your  HP by at least 60%. That's  why you  need Marle. She
and Crono can perform Aura Whirl together.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Azala is shocked that you've beaten Nizbel and is terrified of you. He tosses
the Gate Key and flees with his tail between his legs. Grab a box of kleenex
and exchange goodbyes with Ayla and Kino.  Now, head back to Mystic Mountain,
where your warp point awaits.

THE MASAMUNE RETURNS!
You  know the  drill.  Warp to  Medina Village (1000 AD) and  travel  back to
Melchior's Hut! He is blatantly impressed by your having a DreamStone AND the
legendary Masamune in your possession. He'd like to hear how you've come
about to have them, but he'd rather not, as he claims to have a fragile
heart. After snatching the Masamune from your hands like a voracious wolf, he
tells you it may take a while to reforge it. Lucca offers to help and follows
him to his basement. Likewise, follow them  down the stairs. In the basement,
time freezes and they stay momentarily still, until you approach them and try
to start a cheerful conversation.  After what seems to be  hours, you are
finally  bestowed the Masamune--the whole  thing! It's time to  go pay Frog a
visit.

Visit Frog at his usual place, the Cursed Woods. This time instead of sending
you away, he urges you to stay for the night and let him think things over.
At this point, you are regaled with flashbacks of Frog's past (as in, when he
was actually human). In clips of his past, you are introduced for the first
time to Cyrus, the one person Frog has always stood in the shadow of. You are
given an insight to Frog's true nature and emotions.

During the flashback, you learn that  his name is  Glenn. Let me point out to
you that the Glenn from CC and this Glenn ARE NOT the same person.  I repeat,
they are NOT same person. If you go saying they are, I'll beat you silly with
a stick. Magus was  the primary cause of the human-to-frog transformation and
Frog's dire misfortune. After you've seen just about all you can see up to
this point, Frog wakes Crono and co  and decides to tag along after all. Time
to, again, force someone to kick the can, as you'll need Frog at your side
from this point on. You may need to re-equip Frog with proper defense  attire
since he hasn't changed since the last meeting.

With Frog in party, head all the way to the Magic Cave, which is located just
to the southeast of Denadoro Mountain. But first, to properly prepare you
and your party with this villainous individual, you will want to channel some
magic power to good ol' Frog since he is at a disadvantage in the world of
magicians. And to do that, visit Spekkio at the End of Time. He'll grant Frog
Water magic 'cause he's an amphibious  creature who  likes  getting  his feet
wet.

time to scout out those chests. In the process,      |  MagicScarf          |
notice that the townsfolk here are acting rather     |  Speed Belt          |
strange. The only responses you get are "Ha...Ha"    |  Slasher             |
and "Wanna play?" and other eerie things like        |______________________|
that. You can't do anything about the quartet
guarding the chest on the right just yet. When you've cleaned
out the chests in both areas, examine the illusionary save point.

Not a save point, but Ozzie, the plump general. He informs you that Sir Magus
is rather busy right now and will not honor  an audience at this time. But if
you want to see him, you'll have to battle all _100_ monsters  and the three
tone-deaf, evil fiends: Ozzie, Slash and  Flea.  As he makes his disappearing
act, he leaves a parting  gift of 4 Henches and 2 Vamps. He's  so thoughtful.

It's time to crack your knuckles and relax while you can. Go out and save now
as the going about is going to get really rough. At this point, you can't go
any further until you've  met and defeated two of the evil fiends--Slash and
Flea. It's your choice of which of  the two you'd like to murder first. As
for the walkthrough, I'm going with Flea first since  he's not that much of a
threat as Slash is. But to prepare for him, make sure you equip Magic
Defense-raising accessories. Although Slash and Flea are not at all difficult
opponents, they have an insane amount of HP to liquidate; it's just like them
to be lame-brained bastards. As you have suspected, they may turn out to be
lengthy battles. But cheer up, if you  stay alive  long enough, you will etch
in their minds some sense to not mess with you.

To face Flea first, take the right path (left for Slash). Speak  with the boy
and answer "Yes". Before you are allowed to battle Flea, you must prove your
skills to the master of the castle by defeating four Shadows (this is
actually optional). If you don't remember from Lab 16, these piles of goo are
defenseless to magic attacks. The content in the chest is a measly [BARRIER].
Not too  great, not  too bad, but considering  you had  to waste  a few magic
points, it'd be better to have gotten something worthy of the effort.

On your  way to the  throne room, the people you  come across  reflect on the
characters you bring with you. But that doesn't matter too much as they are
the same enemies. You have to face Sorcerers--not a strenuous task. The first
and last battles are avoidable, however, the one inbetween is not. In the
throne room, you find a funny-looking thing already waiting inside. Frog
assumes that he is Flea. It dies with one hit of the X-Strike. As it dies, it
casts the  annoying MP Buster on one  of your characters, draining every last
bit of his MP.

Alas, it was a  fraud. The real  Flea appears, and it  is apparently  the bat
that had been following you around the whole time! That cross-dresser of a
person or thing is one nemesis you shouldn't take lightly. On an unrelated
note, Flea, in my perspective, is a woman  since in  Chrono Cross, she looked
so feminine it's sickening. So, it's a her. End of story.


BOSS: FLEA                                                        HP: 4120

         The Stare

Despite the  fact that  she looks  so brittle  and swanky, she  still has the
power, believe or not, to wipe your party off the map. With her constant
use of Prism Beam, Rainbow Storm and The Stare, she is one tough hoochie,
although not utterly challenging. The downside  to her  attacks is that they
cause various status effects. If at the proper level and equipped with
grade-A armor up to this point, the party should take no more than 50 damage
each time. Continuously use X-Strike to put her in her place. X-Strike
should do (it did for me) roughly 500 damage each time.  Don't bother with
physical attacks as they will miss constantly. The Stare attack poses the
biggest threat, as it can charm one of your characters to turncoat and attack
the whole party, and most of the time it's Crono.

She feels quite  humiliated  that she's been defeated by low-class humans. As
she leaves, a [MAGIC TAB] replaces her silhouette. Take the chance to save or
be eternally damned. The next  fight is going  be a tad more difficult. Oops,
did I scare you?


BOSS: SLASH                                                       HP: 5200

         Fury Attacks                                             1500 G

Slash is more than enough for you to handle, especially when the  mark of his
demise draws nearer and nearer, where he tends to get nasty. Unfortunately
for you, he is required to be  defeated twice in order for him to be _really_
defeated. His first self is easy and is pretty much self-explanatory.
However, round 2 is another story. It's kill or be killed. Just keep
pummeling him with X-Strike and occasionally Aura Whirl (with Marle if you
have her) on the party to recover any lost HP. It will be quite frequent once
Slash gets used to his Jump  Slash and Fury  Attacks. Both the Jump Slash and
Fury Attack can do about 100 damage.  I'm not  exaggerating. I had my Defense
at over 100 too! So, he is strong. He gets really  dangerous if he decides to
use Jump Slash/Fury Attack consecutively. You'd better  have plenty of Revive
handy and may peanut butter help you through this.

I have a tip  that will make  the fight  with Slash in Magus's castle so much
easier. Although I like to have a party of Chrono, Frog and Lucca, right
before the Slash fight I put Robo in the party.  Why, you say?  I'll tell you
my friend.  The Triple Raid attack will hit Slash for nearly 1000 damage.  So
simply follow this pattern:

1. Triple Raid
2. Cure whoever ate one of Slash's attacks
3. Repeat until Slash meets his untimely doom

He, like Flea, is baffled  by the fact you were able to defeat the right-hand
to Magus, or Ozzie. He bids farewell and leaves a remnant of his rage, the
[SLASHER], a sword for Crono, as well as  a Save Point. It's about damn time!
The  save point that  appears in the  hallway is  actually a warp  point that
teleports the party to another room in the castle.

From here onwards, you will  have to suffer  through countless, and I do mean
countless fights with tough and tougher enemies. It will get so annoying, you
will be screaming for the madness to stop no more than 5 minutes later.  Be
strong, my audacious friend. For the  next few  events, the point is to avoid
Ozzie's tricks and fight your way to approach him. Don't miss the awesome
treasures on the way! Every time you manage to  foil his  nefarious plans, he
turns tail and flees. But he seems to always drop a few lovely gifts.

Once you reach the room where you can see Ozzie on the other side, attempt to
walk towards him. He'll pull the switch and let out a laugh as your party
plummets to the bottom. In the  torture chamber, 6 Decedents  are resurrected
to throw a party for you. In the chamber, there are four Save Points  located
in the north, south, west and east directions. The first  time you stop here,
the western save point is a veritable save point, while the one on the
opposite side (east) is the warp point you want. It transports you back to
the room where you  last saw Ozzie. The remaining  two result  in fights with
uh, save points. Inane-looking things, but they let out  huge amounts of EXP.

Back in the room, try your luck in  walking and  guessing which tiles are not
traps.  But if you do happen to revisit that room again, the correct save
points will have relocated and you will have to use your random guessing
abilities to  identify them. Keep trying  and you'll  eventually reach Ozzie.
As per usual, he retreats.

From here, you will have to  fight in a series of annoying battles with tough
enemies such as the Juggler. The Juggler is a bit tricky. Once you attack it
with either a physical or magic attack, it activates the defense system for
the last attack you inflicted upon him.  For example, if you attacked him
first with a magic attack, Magic Attack Defense On appears on the screen. You
should now use a physical attack to counter  the defense system. This pattern
will repeat itself until it dies. Be careful from  this point onwards, as the
monsters can perform dual techs of their own, specifically, the Outlaw with a
Juggler.

When you finally get to confront Ozzie, he has no where to run and decides to
finish this once and for all. Ozzie creates an ice barrier surrounding his
entire body. It repels _all_ attacks. To make it worse, he counters with a
devastating attack. The secret  is to attack the four  chains dangling behind
him. The last chain  opens a hidden hole underneath Ozzie, sending him to the
fiery pits of hell. Take the chance to save now. Magus is waiting just ahead.
In a haunting image of Frog--anime style--he stands up to Magus, face to face
again. Music plays out and the battle between life and death ensues...


BOSS: MAGUS                                                        HP: 6666
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Level 2 elemental attacks                         Gained: 1500 EXP
         Dark Matter                                                 15 TP
         Geyser                                                    3000 G

He's one hella tough guy. You must max  out your defense  and attack power as
much as possible to this point. His attack pattern is something I've never
encountered in a game before. It's easy to catch on to, but hard to actually
use it to your advantage.  He has a magic barrier that allows specific magic
elementals to hurt him. It's not a guessing game, as the text is displayed on
the screen at the top.

If you use an elemental attack other than the one specified, you  will end up
doing him a big favor by healing his wounds, if any. What's worse is that
whatever magic that he is susceptible to currently, he will cast it as a
level 2 spell on your party. If your party does not have that certain
elemental attribute, then coerce him to change barriers with a physical
attack. On a quite frequent basis, he casts Geyser, which not only takes away
some HP, but it also causes each character's HP to slowly deteriorate.

Once you've hacked away about 3000HP, he will start to cast Dark Matter which
does about 200 damage to all members. However, you have a small amount of
time in-between to squeeze a few relentless attacks. When he does prepare  to
cast Dark Matter, he will  be off guard. This is your  only chance to use the
most powerful techs you have. Good luck.

When Magus puts up the Lightning Barrier, have Crono and Frog do the Spire
tech.  It will hit Magus for approximately 740+ damage every time.  However,
when Magus casts Dark Matter, use Frog's Heal spell twice.  I also used Robo
and things were never the easier.

Magus tacitly  admits that he had  underestimated the power of the  Masamune.
As Magus barely finishes his last sentence, a great roar pervades the screen.
The awakening of Lavos has begun, and it is out  of Magus' control. He blames
it on you for intervening with his ritual. The party throws a few curt
remarks at Magus, only to find that Magus hadn't created Lavos, just summoned
it.  A huge time distortion sucks the party and sends them into the void, but
to where exactly?

Instead of that hopeful dream Crono had, the party finds themselves in Ayla's
hut. When you regain control of your characters, everything is pretty much
the way it had been before you left. However, there are some new weapons in
the Ioka Trading Hut  that may interest you.  These trade-offs are worth your
effort.

           Dream Gun    =   Petal and Fang
           Dream Bow    =   Petal and Horn
           Magma Hand   =   Petal and Feather
           Aeon Blade   =   Fang and Horn
           Ruby Vest    =   Fang and Feather
           Rock Helm    =   Horn and Feather


Be sure to get  the Aeon Blade  for Crono and the  weapons for the characters
you use frequently. Afterward, travel to the  Laruba Ruins inside the ring of
trees. The chief of Laruba and Ayla are conversing and you can hear every bit
of their conversation. Apparently, the Reptites' keen method that enabled
them to find Laruba was by following Ayla.  Follow her out to the Dactyl Nest
in the north.

AZALA'S FOREBODING FUTURE
Tyrano's Lair begins with a welcome party--2 annoying  Cave Apes and an extra
Reptite. They're thrilled to see you. Now, go through the fossilized head to
the other room and up the stairs you go. Take on the Reptites and free the
incarcerated villagers as you go. Kino is also imprisoned in the last holding
cell. Ayla tries to ram the cell door open, but to no avail. Once Kino is
freed, he bids you to follow him.  Before you do, the egg-shaped container in
the cell is a chest. Be on the look out for more of these as you infiltrate
Tyrano's Lair. Kino is  patiently waiting for you back at the entrance. After
speaking  with him, he displays his  barbaric strength  by opening  the other
head's mouth for you.

The stairs lead to a higher level of the tower where you'll meet Reptites and
other monsters that are just itching to see you. And since you don't have all
the time in the world to play with them, step on both  floor switches to dump
them to the depths below. However, if you do this, you'd have to fight them
later if you fall into a trap.  But since I'm helping  you out, you shouldn't
need to ever see them again. Anyway, head to the right first to collect a
[FULL TONIC] from the  left chest _only_. Do NOT  open the  right one. It's a
cleverly rigged trap. Return to the previous room and head to the other side.

In this room, you'll find that the chamber is full of invisible teleportation
devices installed into the tiles. There is no possible way to identify them,
as they have no distinct appearances. These teleport you to other areas in
the room. No biggie there, right? Wrong. Apparently, some chests, the  one on
the upper right to be exact, requires you to teleport yourself around to be
able to get to the chest. The other three are easy enough to get on your own,
but the last one may cause you to seek my guidance. So, I have generously
provided  a mini-map of the tiles you need to step on to teleport yourself to
the right places.


 +---------------------+

Ok, what I have here is a rough  layout of the  entire room. It's not exactly
drawn to scale, but it  should suffice. Here are  three easy  steps to get to
the chest.

1. Begin by heading to the upper right portion of the room to location [2].
2. This teleporter transports you to location [A].
3. Run into the teleporter situated at location [1].

Hopefully after looking at the map and  drinking in my simple directions, you
will appear just underneath the chest that contains the [MESO MAIL]. After
you've collected all the treasures, head up the stairs to an even higher
level. Battle your way to  the unlocked gate, and step on the right switch to
proceed into the control room. Push the switch for the gate to open.

Inside, you run into a  face you have hoped to never see  again. It's Nizbel,
but he has no intentions to fight you. Save now or wallow in self-remorse.
As you attempt to run  up the stairs, Nizbel calls you from behind and taunts
your party. Hence, a fight begins.


BOSS: NIZBEL II                                                    HP: 4200
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Electric Wave                                     Gained:  880 EXP
         Stomp!                                                      15 TP
         Power Ram                                                    0 G

He's back, he's yellow and he's more powerful than ever to crush your marrow-
filled bones. You can apply the same tactics from the last meeting, but this
time, not only will Lightning shatter his defense, but also, as you damage
him, his defense will strengthen again. So it's a sea-saw battle. Casting
Lightning is on one end, and attacking him is on the other.  You're going to
have to cast Lightning every round to exploit his weakness. Then use Volt
Bite, a dual tech performed by Crono and Ayla. Every so often, he'll attempt
to annihilate the party with his explosive Electric Wave, which dishes out
approximately 150-200 damage each time.  Survival of the fittest.  Stay alive
long enough and you'll pull through.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Witness Nizbel get reduced to nothing, then save  again and  head out. On the
balcony, there is a firm insinuation that you are not allowed to meet Azala.
There are about 6 battles here, some of which are against Reptites and the
mighty Terrasaur. Terrasaurs may seem extremely difficult to deal with at
first glance, but once you shock it with Crono's lightning, it takes only one
flick of the index  finger to totally  wipe it out. The Volcanoes are utterly
baffling since they seem to attack each other.

In the room  with three  switches on the  floor, step on them  in this order:
Top, left, and right. Throw the switch to unlock the center gate. Finally,
it's time to settle things with Azala.  When you approach him, he only laughs
at your party and talks as if he expected you would make it far enough to
face him. Azala hops  down and heads out the  door behind him. Don't overlook
the two chests on either side of the throne.

High above the bubbling lava, Azala awaits  your arrival, along with his pet,
Black Tyrano. Blacky seems a little hungry...


BOSS: BLACK TYRANO/AZALA                  HP: 10,500 (Tyrano), 2700 (Azala)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: PsychoKenesis, Teleportation,                     Gained: 1800 EXP
         Devour, Telepathy,                                          25 TP
         Flamethrower, Azala Break                                    0 G

I can tell from the twinkle in your eye that you're just ecstatic to see this
much HP. Boy, will we have fun. Despite the HP overkill, this isn't as hard
as you'd expect it to be. Only if you follow my method. Lengthy maybe, but it
works. First, you'll need Frog in your party. Why? His Heal ability will be
the party's life support and because it's a single tech, not a dual tech. Ok,
with that in mind, time to put you to the ultimate test. Azala's an annoyance
by casting all those spells. Put him to rest by relentlessly casting
Lightning on him. NOT Lightning2. Do NOT attack Tyrano yet; he will only
brutally cast  a counter-blow  that will  tear your  party  to pieces, nearly
killing them.

Keep casting Lightning on Azala either until he dies, or Tyrano starts to let
up his defense for an attack. At this time, have Frog and Crono perform their
X-Strike for mega damage (500+). Ayla's role plays as a second-hand healer.
Always have her ready to cast her Kiss spell to whomever's HP drops below
200. If everyone is  healthy and  in tip-top  shape, you can  risk inflicting
some extra damage to Tyrano by having Ayla perform Rollo Kick.

Tyrano performs a countdown once he's open to  attack, whereby a  mighty roar
escapes to indicate that it's drawing nearer to zero. When this countdown
reaches zero, Tyrano uses the deathblow FlameThrower (a name made up by me).
This group attack is enough to wipe out the  entire party, but at your fairly
high level, they should all still be standing. Quickly  have Frog use Heal on
the party twice, and Ayla can fill in the gaps  of lost HP amounts. Since you
can't attack Tyrano until his shield  is down, 'tis a good time to revitalize
the party. Occasionally, Tyrano will slurp up a party member and spit 'im
back out with half of his HP gone. Simply use Ayla to bring it back up again.
Keep up this assault and Tyrano will eventually bite the dust.

---------------
DID YOU KNOW?

In the  Black  Tyrano/Azala battle, you got  the  X-Strike  strategy, but you
neglected to mention the vicious amount of damage Volt Bite dishes out to the
Tyrano. If you have it at this point, use it every chance you get!  Save your
3rd character for healing, and  when he  drops his guard, Unleash the fury of
the Volt Bite attack.  You can take  him down  within two defense drops.

Thanks to Graeme Laird

Black Tyrano  becomes a  fragment  of your  imagination, and  Azala  is lying
helplessly on the ground, gravely injured. Ayla feels sympathetic and prompts
Azala to escape with her. Azala, of course, rebuffs her kindness and proceeds
to reveal to the party that there will be a time when the world is composed
of nothing but ice, known as the Ice Age, and humans will have perished. At
this point, you see an asteroid engulfed by red flames, speeding toward the
planet. It's Lavos! Magus  didn't  create  Lavos  afterall; Lavos had arrived
from space in this period of time.

After regaining control of your characters, inspect the Lair Ruins to find an
active gate. The portal calls  out to you. Hop in to  find out where it leads
to.

interminable blizzard rages on and obscures the

zation floating high above the bleak surface that has  been surmounted by the
snow.  It's amazing and it looks so peaceful. I like the song that plays in
the background, too. ^_^ The first accessible town at this point is obviously
the one nearest to you, Enhasa.

As you speak with the people in town, you find that their technology is quite
advance. The people here are all selected magicians who study under the queen
of this kingdom--the kingdom of Zeal. As you adapt to the refreshing
surroundings, check out the books, as they can burst into flames or spurt
water. The books have a purpose, not just for eye candy. You have to open the
books in a proper order so that a secret passage will be revealed near the
last book  opened, which is Fire. Open the  books in this  order: Water, Wind
and Fire.

There is a secret room beyond the passage, and inside is a Nu. You can impose
a challenge on it and win a [MAGIC TAB] and a [SPEED TAB]. They are, however,
stupendously tough. You will also bump into a sullen boy with a bad attitude.
He gives you an ominous foretaste of your future.

Once you've finished conversing with the people of the town, you may head out
and head to the northern land-bridge. On the ground below, trudge through the
snow to the north to another Skyway. This one  leads to the main continent of
the Zeal Kingdom. Upon your arrival on the main floating continent, visit the
BlackBird first. There, you'll meet Sir Dalton, an ill-humored knight, or
captain. One of those. He recognizes your party as the evil-doers the prophet
warned of. He's too full of himself to do anything.

At the Queen's puppet town of Kajar, open  the books  again in the same order
to reveal yet another secret room. Inside is a poyozo doll that holds a
[BLACK ROCK]. There's another  Spring of Recovery  here, although you may not
need it, as well as a guy offering hints about the mythical Rainbow Shell and
Sun Stone. In the Magic Tab development room, search  the bottom right corner
of the room for a [SPEED TAB].

WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE PALACE
Zeal Palace is  accessible by going  through the caves and  transporting your
party to the summit of the mountain the palace sits on. There's much to do.
First, if you want another Magic Tab, offer to help scratch the Nu that's
chafing  his back against the wall on the overpass to discover a Nu's scratch
point. Return to Kajar and  scratch the Nu in the  Magic Tab  developing room
for it to cough out a [MAGIC TAB].

There's a woman standing near a plant in the bottom left area of the room. Be
sure to  tell her to "Secretly Plant the sapling".  This helps  begin a  side
quest later on in the game.

In the upper right chamber is the bedroom where Schala is resting. There, you
will witness a small sequence between her brother, Janus, and herself. She
notices you as she walks out, but is pestered by the maid to go see the queen
in haste. Follow her to the main room, where she uses her pendant to open the
sealed door. Your pendant, unfortunately, has no effect. To evoke its true
power, go to the Mammon Machine. Examine the center pedestal, and the machine
dissipates its energy on Marle's pendant.  Return to the  sealed door and try
again. This time it works!

Inside the main room, the  queen senses your presence and commands  Dalton to
make short work of you. They disappear, and a bestial-looking  creature takes
their place.


BOSS: GOLEM                                                        HP: 7000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Iron Orb                                          Gained: 1000 EXP
         Copy Cat                                                    35 TP
                                                                   2000 G

At your level, this guy really can make short work of you. Its Iron Orb drops
your HP by half and he delivers the deathblow with CopyCat, which is an
attack based on the damage dealt to him, only stronger. There's no way to win
the battle at this time, unless you're playing a New Game+. Just sit back and
watch him whoop your ass, which won't take long. I'll explain how to beat him
later.

---------------
HE'S POSSIBLE TO DEFEAT THE FIRST TIME AROUND!

As you may know, the Golem attacks you two ways: by throwing the "Iron Ball"
at you (which cuts your HP in half) and by duplicating the attack that you
did to him last with his "Copy Cat" move (in other words, if you hit him with
Lightning 2, he'll return with a very powerful lightning attack that will
probably kill you, and ice with ice, and so on). He does the duplication
attack only after a certain amount of time (let's say he does the Copy Cat
once for every 4 turns that your characters go).

So what you do is start off by having one of your characters, say Marle,
attack with Ice 1 (NOT Ice 2, this is important). Then wait. Golem will
duplicate the Ice 1 with a weak ice attack against you. This works with other
weak spells, too (Lightning 1, Fire 1, Water 1). Do NOT use physical
attacks... this makes him do a rather powerful counter-attack. So, right
after he duplicates your weak attack with a weak attack of his own, have the
next one or two characters use their most powerful attacks (try to avoid
double or triple techs). Now the key is, right before he is about use his
Copy Cat again, make sure your last character before that uses one of those
weak spells (Ice 1, etc.) on him. Since he only copies the last attack (which
should be weak), his Copy Cat should hardly hurt you at all. He will still
use his Iron Ball attack so make sure you heal from time to time.

I hope this is all clear; it's hard to explain. But you can beat Golem really
easily once you get the hang of it. What do you get for beating him? Some
nice experience, but that's about it. Nothing changes in the story... you're
still captured. But just so ya know, it's possible to win.

Thanks to John M. for this


With this technique you can defeat the Golem with only getting hit once!
You need three characters with different elements to them (basically not
Marle and Frog on the same team). Then once the battle starts Crono will be
"Iron balled". After that have the first character cast their elemental spell
(Fire1 or Fire2 for example) the screen will read "Copycat skill/ copy fire
techniques". At this point the Golem's attack preparation bar will reset as
it prepares a fire counterattack. Wait until the character that first cast
the spell's attack preparation bar has gotten half full then have another
character cast any different elements (or physics). The Golem will change
his technique to that element and here's the key part: his attack preparation
bar will reset again! If you keep waiting until the last person who attack's
bar is half full before attacking the enemy's bar will keep resetting and
he'll never attack again!

Does that make sense? Here's an example of how I usually do it. I have Frog,
Crono, and Lucca on my team. (I use a slight variation here to get in two
attacks at once but otherwise I'm following the procedure I mentioned above).
I wait until Frog's bar is full then I cast "Water" then I wait until Frog's
bar is half full, then Crono uses "Spincut" immediately followed by Lucca's
"Fire". Then I wait until Frog's bar fills and then cast "Water". I repeat
until the Golem dies.

Thanks to Knightly Knave for this strategy.


In case of elemental attacks, the guy will copy only the element you use
against it and its level, without considering further stuff. What does that
mean? Basically, that you can whoop his arse using elemental double techs.
For example: using Volt Bite on it not only you deal around 1150 damage per
hit (I have my characters at about level 27 or 28), but he will also counter
with a basic lightning spell, since Volt Bite = lightning + Cat Attack. That
means, any attack which involves a Level 1 spell will be countered with
something lousy at best, and having Frog doing the healing is just a breeze.

Thanks to Leo.

With the entire  party lying  unconscious  on the  floor, Queen  Zeal and the
others return  to their positions and laugh in triumph at your pathetic self.
They imprison you within the energy field of the Mammon Machine. At this
point, Schala appears to free your party. She wants you  to help her find the
Gurus, namely, Melchior, who has been banished to Mt. Woe.  Before your party
can accept her wishes, the mysterious Prophet appears to meddle with your
plans. He and Schala make a compromise to let you go, but under the condition
that you return to  your time. After  returning to prehistoric time, the Time
Gate to 12,000 BC is sealed.  Looks like they don't like you much.

Once you have the idea of your next destination, it's time to go there.  That
place is in 2300 AD.

During the descent, a guard will notice you and      |  Rage Band           |
run off to warn Sir Krawlie. Make your way towards   |  GoldErng            |
the bottom of the screen to find two frogs. They     |  Bolt Sword          |
play a small role of guiding you through the         |______________________|
sewers, as they provide subtle hints about
navigating the sewer depths. Various switches are
needed to extend bridges. As they leap down the ladder, follow them.

At the bottom, you can choose to read the note on the ground for a small tip.
As you make your way to the other side, steer clear of touching anything
littered along the path, as the slightest noise can instigate battles with
Nereids. They're not  tough, just annoying. Ignore the  save point at the end
for it is a trap.

Head up and hang a right into a narrow corridor.  Throw the switch and return
to the north, following  the contour of the back wall. Then move down through
the now-unlocked door.  Here, there's another sequence with the frogs as they
explain how to expand the bridge. Keep moving and pick up the [RAGE BAND]
from the chest. On the other side of the bridge  is the guard that caught you
intruding earlier and Krawlie, a boisterous little insect-like creature.

After a dry laugh, they finally notice you  and Krawlie attacks.  No need for
much of a boss strategy if you're at this power level. Although Krawlie  does
have an attack that can reduce your HP to 1, but that doesn't matter much
since it'll die in about 4 blows. Afterward, curve around  and hit the switch
for the bridge. Then climb up the ladder to the World Map.

WINGS OF HOPE
Refrain from entering Death Peak and move  along to  Keeper's Dome.  Once you
have taken refuge in the nearly deserted dome, head to the door at the top.
Ignore the snoozing and only inhabitant of the area. Beyond that room are
three shimmering dots of what seem  to be Tabs, but unfortunately, you're not
that lucky. The dots reveal the voice of Belthasar, the Guru of Time. The
very same from 12,000 BC. He starts explaining the events that occurred in
Zeal Kingdom that had thrown him forward in time. You'll also  get an insight
at how Lavos came to be (as if you didn't already know enough about it).
Continue along while checking the dots. Beyond the sealed door is Belthasar's
last and greatest invention, the Wings of Time.

For the first time, you get to  feast your eyes on the  coolest flying object
that'll take your butt anywhere. Thank Belthasar. Oh, and the guys at Square.
Go to the far end of the aircraft to fully marvel its brilliance. Then
attempt to leave. The Nu from the entrance butts in and wheels in a pilot's
seat. Can't leave the place without one it seems. It's a reincarnated form of
Belthasar, or rather, his memory implanted into a body of a Nu. Name the
Wings of Time, better known as the Epoch. Now power up the  Epoch and watch a
cool anime sequence of Crono's starting the engine.

Travel to 12,000 BC, but  you soon  find  that the Skyway  has malfunctioned.
For now, make a stop at the Terra Cave located on the northwestern tip of the
continent.

WE ARE EARTHBOUNDERS!
Terra Cave is a decent  place where the  Earthbound ones, as the  enlightened
ones call them, live. The merchant selling weapons, items and equipment have
great selections. You can choose to upgrade your weapons now, but if you wait
a while, you can Charm powerful weapons from the inhabitants of Mt. Woe. Only
get what is necessary. Optimizing full  defense is mandatory for the upcoming
battles, so you could go ahead and re-furnish your characters. After shopping
for your daily needs, there's a place where you could rest three floors down.
It's free, so don't hesitate to recover your HP/MP.

At the bottom is a save point. The right doorway leads to the Beast Nest that
connects to Mt. Woe. A recommended party for this excursion is Crono, Frog
and Ayla. Why? You'll see later. At the bottom right of the screen is a
partially  hidden [POWER TAB]. It's rather  hard to  see.  Anyway, there is a
total of 3 fights. Two of which are with Beasts. As you deal  damage to these
mammals, they can increase their attack power by absorbing the damage dealt
to them. It's wise to finish them off as quickly as possible. If you have the
Charm ability, you can charm a Rainbow Helm, a really good defense-increasing
helmet, from each  Beast. This is a  one-time  opportunity to  have 4 Rainbow
Helms in your possession!

At the end of the small cave is a barricade of two colored beasts and an Imp.
The little runt...

'Tis nothing compared to what's coming up.  This is just a shadow of the next
boss. Don't panic, though. I'm here to guide you remember. It  seems that the
Mud Imp is the leader of the trio. It throws rocks at the Beasts to coerce
them to charge at you.  Almost always, the Imp will hop on the beast and plow
through one of your party members as a counterblow. On occasion, the Imp will
also recover the entire party (not yours) by 150HP.

As the fight lags on, you discover that the Imp cannot be hurt  sufficiently.
No problem. Just concentrate on one at a time. Start with the Blue Beast.
Remember what I told you about having a party consisted of Crono, Frog and
Ayla? Here's where they come into play. Have Crono  and Ayla use Volt Bite on
the Blue Beast 'til you  eliminate it, while Frog heals the party.  Next, use
SwordStream on the Red Beast to make very short work of it. If you don't have
SwordStream, Ice Sword with Marle works efficiently as well. When you've KOed
the two Beasts, the Mud Imp will be a cinch.

Now that they're out of the way, you can  continue to Mt. Woe, where Melchior

Your party climbs  to the peak of Mt. Woe, and  arrives at a dead end with an
abyss drilled deep in the earth just in front of them. To your dismay,
Melchior is trapped in a block of ice, and as you approach it, it disappears.
In its place comes a huge, cool-looking boss...Whoever said this rescue
mission was a freebie...


BOSS: GIGA GAIA                                                    HP: 9500
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Dark Plasma,                                      Gained: 3000 EXP
         Double Hand Blaster,                                        30 TP
         Defense Arm Recover                                       3000 G

Before any of your characters can  become active, you can bet your liver that
he can whither away your HP to danger level with his 2-hand attacks. His most
powerful being Double Hand Blaster. This is a dead give away that Giga Gaia
must need both hands to enact these devastating attacks.  Immediately after
the Volt Bite dual tech becomes available, use it on the left hand(your left,
not his). Do this twice until it disappears. Now that that you have deprived
Giga Gaia of his two powerful attacks, he's helpless puppy. Now, use Crono
and Frog's Spire attack on the body and repeat. After a few rounds, Gaia will
resurrect its hand and the pattern recycles, except the left hand will die in
one hit of the Volt Bite from here on out. Ignore the right hand, as it's not
life-threatening. If necessary, use Frog's Heal to replenish lost HP.

I found a really easy way to beat that $%&#&%# Giga Gaia really quickly.
Falcon Hit.  I swear it works like a charm as it kills all three parts at the
same time.

Melchior re-appears and escorts the party to Terra Cave.  Note that if you've
missed the chance to charm the weapons from the monsters in Mt. Woe, don't
dwell on it since they can be bought in Kajar now. At the Terra Cave, Schala
comes to  visit the party  and Melchior. At the same time, sir Dalton appears
and flashes a glint of evil. He kidnaps Schala and disappears. Speak with
Melchior afterwards  to receive the [RUBY KNIFE].  It is NOT a weapon, but an
item to destroy the Mammon Machine with.

Re-group and return to the Skyway, as it is now working. Make a quick stop at
Kajar and speak to the Nu selling items. Be honest and he'll sell you nice
items. Then head to Zeal Palace and go into the room where the party had been
beaten to death  by the Golem—-the throne  room. Inside, you'll  meet up with
the culprit, Dalton.


BOSS: DALTON                                                       HP: 3500
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Iron Orb,                                         Gained: 1000 EXP
         Black Haze,                                                 30 TP
         Blurp                                                     2500 G

He's surprisingly easy to beat. Give him a taste of your Ice Sword and Spire.
If he's not crying bloody murder by now, finish him off with a few physical
attacks. The only attacks you  should keep  an eye out for are Black Haze and
possibly Iron Orb.

Dalton is not one to  admit defeat so quickly. He  escapes the  gravitational
pull of death and teleports himself to  the Ocean Palace...with Crono  and co
in pursuit.

a back room with a save point and Mune blocking      |  Aeon Helm           |
the door to the next area. You don't have to fight   |  Aeon Suit           |

about the black energy growing. Beyond the door      |  Rune Blade          |
Mune is corking off is a helluva lot of tough        |  Star Sword          |
enemies. You best be equipped with the most durable  |  Demon Hit           |

UNDER DA SEA!                                        |______________________|
The two diverging pathways at the starting point of
this room are connected to the western and eastern
rooms. In the large area ahead, pick up the [RUNE BLADE] and the [AEON SUIT],
as they are fairly easy to overlook. A [STAR SWORD] is waiting inside the
west room, but you need  to earn it through blood and sweat. You  can't reach
the platform yet, but wrap around  the path and go through the hidden doorway
to get to the [DEMON HIT].

In the opposite  room, there is an [AEON HELM], but it's  guarded by some Red
Scouts and a Mage. From here, you can reach the platform. As you step over
the blue floor tiles, a battle ensues. Move to the  blue orb in the floor and
switch it on. This raises a platform in the south that leads to a new area.
Before leaving this  place, plunder the  chests in the  lower left  and right
rooms for various treasure.


   ________USELESS TRIVIA
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | The enemies here require more than just brute strength. For the "colored"|
 | scouts, they will only take specific elemental attacks. Red—Fire, Blue-  |
 | Water/Ice, and Yellow-Lightning. As for the Jinn and Barghest couple, be |
 | sure to eliminate Barghest _first_. Otherwise, Jinn will suffer minimal  |
 | damage.                                                                  |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


Once you've reached  the other side of  the doorway, it will  be a journey of
descent through endless flights of stairs. On the way down, you will meet
some resistance by Thrashers, Lashers and a few Mages. At the last stairwell,
you bump into Masa. Approach the two swirly objects, and they turn into the
notorious Jinn/Barghest duo! After you give them a piece of your sword, use a
Shelter at the save point. You'll need it.

Proceed to the center of the room; you'll be  attacked by a group of monsters
who are all very happy to see you. Dispose of them and examine the sparkling
dot on the orb at the left. It appears to be the switch  for the elevator. As
the party makes their descent down the abysmal shaft, they are continuously
assaulted by diverse groups  of monsters. You need to  survive three grueling
battles that get tougher and tougher.

When/if you come to a stop, you could  choose to continue, or put  aside some
time to get an extra Magic Tab (too many won't hurt!). If you want to just
get the boss over with, take the party to both control rooms on either side
and step on the blue orb in the center to expand the bridge. If you are a
perfectionist, then re-enter the area again and hop on the elevator again for
a ride back to the very top. The [MAGIC TAB] will shimmer  for a second. When
you take a second trip back down, you'll have to battle the monsters all over
again.

Take the final treasure, an [ELIXIR], from the chest and move forward to meet
a very arrogant fool. He sics the Golem Twins  on your party and leaves. Here
is a recommended party: Crono, Frog and Lucca


BOSS: GOLEM TWINS                                                  HP: 7000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Iron Orb,                                         Gained: 2000 EXP
         Blurp,                                                      70 TP
         CopyCat                                                   4000 G

For the first few tries, you may classify these two in the "Hardest bosses of
all time!" file, but you may also overlook the fact that their bulky
appearances are very deceiving. They're actually pretty damn easy. That is,
if you know the secret. This is a  fool-proof way to  beat them. If you don't
have Lucca in your party, I guarantee you that you won't be able to endure
their continuous  beatings for more  than 30 seconds. Until  Lucca is in your
party, you will keep dying (unless you have devised your own strategy).

Anyway, have her use HypnoWave to put them _both_ to sleep. It works 99.9999%
of the time. Once they're asleep, restore the damage from their Iron Orb
assault. Note that the sleep effect will _not_ wear off unless you hurt them.
Now use Spire on _one_ of the twins and do NOT ever, ever touch the other
until the one you're attacking dies. It appears that with its brother
inactive, it rarely uses Iron Orb anymore. So, just finish  it off with Spire
or Fire Sword. Once the first one is gone, do the same to the second. As each
of them die, they will use Dalton's Blurp attack as a last resort.

---------------
Need More Help?

First of all, your party will  consist  of Crono, Robo, and Frog.  Why? Crono
because...well, you HAVE to...and Robo and Frog because of one of their
double techs. I speak, of course, of the awesome Cure Wave.  For a relatively
minor expenditure in MP,  the two of them combine Heal powers to *completely*
cure your party...whether you're at 998 HP, or 1 HP! Keep Robo and Frog
hanging back in reserve to  use this  double tech at will, and have Crono use
Confuse on one of the Golem Twins.  If you're at a decent  level, you  should
walk right over him.

This also works great on Lavos' final form; generally, he can't dole out
enough damage in one round to kill, so you can just completely heal every
round and terminate with extreme prejudice.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This will work.  For it to work *well*,  you'll want to equip
Robo with a speed-increasing accessory. Think 'Bandana'.  Think 'Speed Belt'.
If this is  a New Game +...well, what do  you need this hint for?  But still,
think 'Dash Ring'.

Thanks to Istanbul


Anyways this is how I did it...I charmed a Mermaid Helmet from the Blue Beast
then I got the Blue Mail and Blue Vest then I went to fight the golem guys..I
equipped Crono with the blue vest, Frog with the blue mail, and Ayla with the
mermaid helm...I just casted Luminaire and then I casted Water 2 and used
Ayla to heal occusianally and I charmed a Magic Tab too..I think you could do
this with other elements just get the stuff needed...

Thanks to James Erickson

Greatly disturbed, Lavos finally awakens and is being commanded by the queen.
Removing his disguise, Magus comes to reveal himself. It seems that he had
been thrown back to this period after the accident in Magus' Lair and tricked
Queen Zeal into summoning Lavos under the guise of friendship.

The  screen shifts to a  battle with  the almighty  Lavos. You  finally get a
glimpse of the spaceborne creature. You'll die no matter what if this is your
first time through. Witness Magus' true intentions and afterwards, move Crono
so that he comes in contact with Lavos. An awesome anime sequence ensues.
Then, the screen blacks out...

THE VILLAGE OF HARMONY
The party finds themselves  in the remains of Terra Cave, but its inhabitants
have apparently relocated outside now that the seemingly eternal blizzard has
abated. The Nu in one of the village huts is selling crude support items. You
can't reach the tab behind it until it moves aside, which will be later. Keep
checking back. The man assures you that the Nu will have items worthy of your
time later. Head into the Commons. If you don't have Ayla in your party,
stick her in now.

A few survivors of  the inevitable  downfall of the Zeal Kingdom have come to
reside in the quiet village of Commons. As one villager said, there are no
differences between the Enlightened ones and the Earthbound ones now.  If you
haven't met the uncertain girl with the seed sapling, tell her to plant it
now, or be forever damned.  Well not really, but this helps for the Sunken
Desert side quest. Speak to the village elder in the north. As you do, Dalton
appears and overpowers the party.  Dalton then declares himself  the new king
of the Zeal kingdom and takes the party captive onboard the BlackBird.

Now that Crono is unavailable, you have a new        |  EQUIPMENT           |
party, but there is no fixed party member you        |  C1 Equipment        |
must have, except Ayla. As the party had been        |  C2 Equipment        |
loaded onto the Blackbird as excess baggage,         |  C3 Equipment        |
they've been stripped of their armor, weapons and    |______________________|
just about every single thing you had; you still have
clothes though, thankfully. The party awakens in a holding room.

Climb the  ladder in the  back to find that  you are currently  way above sea
level and if you jump, you're a goner.  Back inside, the  second party member
notices an air vent you could go through.  Climb up to reach the  ventilation
ducts. From the area  directly above the cell room, move to the right and all
the way up. Then make a left until you hit the first juncture. Move up and
left at the second juncture. Further ahead is the ladder leading to the well-
guarded [C1 EQUIPMENT].

Back at the  starting point, head left and go down to  the first intersection
point, then go left. Once you've taken back what truly belongs to you,
backtrack to the cell.  You can watch a short  scene of Dalton remodeling the
Epoch from the southern grate.

Back at the cell, feign illness and lure the guard in. *hint* The inept guard
will be knocked unconscious by the faker. Kudos. Now head to the other room
on the other side of the conveyor belt. The Byte won't attack unless you move
or provoke it. Stand perfectly still if you want to avoid getting caught. Get
your money back from the three Bashers guarding it. Afterwards, head north
past the top first  conveyor belt  and go in the door on the right.  Retrieve
[C2 EQUIPMENT] here. Leave the room and trek  further north, past the guarded
door. Enter the door on the left. Finally, reclaim  your items and go out the
back door.

Make your way to the other side  of the wing.  The Turrets give off more than
ample tech points to unlock some techs. You must launch your hard-hitting
physical attacks before it self-destructs to earn the EXP and TP. The chances
of your getting them break even, unless you just happen to be really good or
a cheap  bastard playing  New Game+. On the other end  of the wing, the Golem
Boss stops you in your tracks.

Yes, it's strange to see a boss with  no attacks, but this fight is just here
to scare you silly. Basically, Golem Boss will perform a life-threatening
countdown. When you see this, you know you'll panic and start launching an
all-out attack on the guy. But get this, once the countdown reaches zero, the
boss chickens out and voids its attack. Then  it starts over from 5 again. It
is apparently afraid of heights. So, why did Square give us this pathetic
monster? Because they're communist bastards who like to play with and tease
us little kids. After a certain amount of time, the boss will either
obliterate  itself, or if you are  quick enough, die and  unleash  all of its
experience goodies.

With the Golem  Boss destroyed, the only hindrance to  getting the Epoch back
now is Dalton. He's just ahead and it's time to settle things with that fool.
The ensuing sequence shows a new beefed-up version of the Epoch. Dalton
tinkered with the Epoch so  that it could fly. He zaps a  laser at the party,
nearly bringing them to their demise. Enraged, the party retaliates.


BOSS: DALTON PLUS                                                  HP: 3500
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Wind Slash,                                       Gained: 2500 EXP
         Opposite Attack,                                            40 TP
         Iron Orb                                                  2000 G

He has little HP that can be knocked off easily.  His  attacks are a lot more
devastating this time around. If you cast an elemental attack on him, ice for
example, he retaliates with an attack of the opposite element, which is fire
in this case. I recommend using only physical attacks. Just use Cure and Heal
on injured characters.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Dalton tries to summon  the Golem Boss to finish  you off, but since you have
already taken care of it, Dalton gets sucked into the portal. The party takes
control of the pilot seat now. You could  either press the [] button to bring
the Blackbird down to a watery grave or fly the Epoch properly. Either way,
it doesn't matter and the repercussions will end up being the same. The Epoch
lands safely next to the  Commons, thanks to your lead  character's expertise
in flight control.

Learn about a mysterious wanderer who stopped by the village and continued to
the North Cape from the villagers. Head to the North Cape, which is located
to the north of Commons, and investigate  the matter. Save your  game. On the
cliff's edge  awaits Magus, where much ado about him and the incident at Zeal
Palace occur. After the  enlightenment, you have to  choose either to  accept
Magus' challenge or  throw in the towel. Accepting his  challenge bags you an
additional boss fight with him. If Frog is in your party, he must partake in
an one-on-one battle with him. If you turn down his delightful offer, attempt
to leave and he joins your party. The choice is in your hands.


BOSS: MAGUS                                                        HP: 6666
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Level 2 Elemental Attacks                         Gained: 2500 EXP
                                                                     40 TP
                                                                   4000 G

If you have your mind set on revenge to  sacrifice having the best magic user
in the game, then more power to you. Having Frog fight him alone is more of a
challenge. Have Frog use Leap Slash and cure himself when needed, which is
quite frequent, mind. After 7 rounds or so, Magus should finally...how should
I put it in a nice way...join the carebears in the sky.

Upon giving him the final blow, he tells you to  seek help from the Gaspar at
the End of Time.
_____________________________________________________________________________


If Magus joined your party, the first  thing you'd  need to do is, of course,
bestow a proper name upon the temperamental magician. He directs the party to
see Gaspar at the End of Time. Go there. Speak with the Old Man, but he
refuses to provide any hints. Return to  the Epoch and he  calls you back. He
finally gives in and forks  over the [CHRONO TRIGGER], as well as  some hints
as to the revival of Crono. But first, go see Belthasar in 2300 AD.

Crono. In essence, you need Crono's Clone. What's    |______________________|
that? Don't ask questions yet. Just return to
Crono's time in 1000 AD.

If you have yet to acquire the Crono Clone, then now is a good time to do it.
Go to Leene's Square and head to Norstein Bekkler's Lab, a purple-ish white
tent situated at the northeast corner in the first area, with 40 Silver
Points in hand. Inside, he offers to give you the  clone only if you win. The
point is to mimic the clone's every movement. If you win, Bekkler delivers
the clone to Crono's House; you could pick it up there. If you lose,
accumulate another 40 Silver Points and try again.  Once you have it, head to
Crono's  House to pick up  the prize. Speak  with his  dear mother  first for
permission to take it.

COLLECT STRONG EQUIPMENT
The list at the top is  misleading, as it doesn't list every single equipment
and item available. Since Death Peak will be a very hard venture, you'll need
to fully equip your characters with the strongest accoutrements you can get
your sticky hands on. Start by traveling from place to place, era to era, and
breaking the seal  on the sealed chests.  See the Seal  Chests/Doors list for
details.

The chests yield  great items to help  boost the  party's power. There  are a
number of things to do to prepare for this treacherous journey, but all are
short, menial tasks. First, warp to 600 AD and examine the sealed chests in
the following  areas: Truce Inn, Porre Elder's  House, and Guardia Castle. In
these three areas, choose NOT to take the item inside. Now, travel forward to
1000 AD and locate the chests in the same areas to pick up better and much
stronger versions of these defense gears.  You should have picked up the Red,
Blue, White and Black Mails. Now  return to the 600 AD period and harvest the
downgraded versions of the mails: The Red, Blue, White and Black Vests.

Next, place the genial princess in your party on your visit to Guardia Castle
in 1000 AD for a bonus sequence. There are great treasures to take there. And
I do mean great. Travel to the blue pyramid in the Medina area to enter the
Forest Ruins. The pendant automatically takes in effect and dissipates the
once-impenetrable force field. The Guru of Reason lets you choose between the
two chests that appear. It doesn't matter which you take as they are both
good items. While you're still  in this time period, go to Lucca's house with
Lucca in party and speak to Taban  twice to receive a [TABAN SUIT] and [TABAN
HELM].

Warp to 65,000,000 BC and go to the Laruba Ruins. Speak to the Nu in the back
to be allowed to change the lead party member's name. Talk to him a second
time to receive a [SILVER ROCK], which invokes the Spin Strike triple tech
enacted by Ayla, Frog and Robo. The Ioka Trading Hut has a new item that
calls for 10 of each item. That item is the Ruby Armor. It's very  much worth
the effort.

If you're done reaping the world of the  sealed chests and extra goodies, you
can choose to take on your first side quest, or continue to Death Peak. You
will need to complete the side quests later if you don't do them now. See the
Side Quests section for details.

Move north and speak with the first Poyozo Doll.     |  Wall Ring           |
After laying out a hint for you, it transforms       |  Giga Arm            |
into a tree. Stand behind it by walking into it.     |  Brave Sword         |
Each time a heavy wind picks up, take cover behind   |  Star Scythe         |
it, then continue trudging through the snow to the   |  Vedic Blade         |
next tree after the wind dies off. You should have   |  Dark Helm           |
enough time inbetween to make it so that you don't   |  Memory Cap          |
get blown off the mountain. There will be several    |______________________|
cases in which you will be in danger of getting
catapulted off the mountain and starting over from
the beginning.

Once you've safely crossed the  first area, continue left and battle with the
Krakkers for the [MAGIC RING] on the left. Climb up the footholds to the
north, and leave through the right. Make your way to the lower level and take
the [WALL RING] from the chest on the far right. There's a save point just at
the south end of the frozen lake. Now enter the cave in the top left. A Lavos
drone awaits your arrival.


BOSS: LAVOS SPAWN                                                  HP: 4000

You will be meeting 2 others after this one, but they are sickeningly easy if
you have Frog, or some other character with a powerful single tech. Don't
ever, ever attack the shell, unless you enjoy dying. Concentrate on the head.
Launch Frog's Leap Slash repeatedly and have the others attack normally. Heal
the wounded and it should be enough to get by  as the spawn of ex-satan has a
measly 3800HP.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Head out the north exit and curve around to the opposite entrance. Go outside
after dealing with the Krakkers and inspect the glowing dot in the back to
open a new cave entrance. Backpedal all the way to the initial save point and
enter the newly discovered cave. Collect the [STAR SCYTHE] nearby and prepare
for another battle with the spawn ahead.

After the second spawn joins its distant brother, move left to the next area.
Talk to the half-frozen Poyozo Doll to learn about the slippery edges. It
starts here, so be wary! To avoid returning to the entrance, balance your
lead character with the D-pad so that he neither slides too far off the
bottom nor the top. Try not to be too  terribly cautious  or you will tend to
mess up.

Elude the  never-ending line of  Krakkers and collect  the [VEDIC BLADE] from
the chest. Then follow the Krakker trail to the south and continue. The
Poyozo Doll shares a hint about moving and climbing a shell. Take the hint,
then drop down below. Climb down the next set of footholds for a [DARK HELM]
and a save point. To the north is the last Lavos Spawn. Once you disintegrate
it, it leaves its steel-like shell behind. Shove it to the footholds on the
right and press X to climb on. Don't miss the [MEMORY CAP] lodged in the snow
at the right.

WELCOME BACK CHRONO TRIGGER!
Continue moving north and the party finally reaches the summit of Death Peak.
There, they use the combined powers of Marle's Pendant and the Chrono Trigger
to bring back a dear friend. During the time freeze, replace the petrified
Crono with the clone.  The party automatically returns to Death Mountain with
Crono. Once Crono rejoins the party and the brief sequence with Crono and
Marle have ended, the game  shifts to the End  of Time, where you can regroup
and re-equip good ol' Crono.

There are  about two ways to meet  with the monstrous fiend behind  the whole
drama. The obvious one being: using the bucket at the End of Time. The other
option is completing the side quests through the Black Omen. Although using
the Black Omen as a transport to confront Lavos is not too wise.  I know this
because I uh, tried. I was successful, but it was hard. You had to fight FOUR
battles with hella tough  bosses in a row with no intervals  whatsoever. It's
mandatory to have your levels above 50, or you won't last 5 seconds! Having a
huge stockpile  of MegaElixirs and  techs at your disposal is key. Lavos uses
powerful group attacks so frequently, you'll have a hard time keeping up your
HP without MegaElixirs.

If you fight Lavos for the first time, it will shed three forms, each tougher
than the last. The first form is no problem, but the last two are the ones
you need to worry about. I'm not afraid to admit it, but it took me about 5
to 6 tries to bring him down on my first game. That was because of my lack of
MegaElixirs.

Before you EVEN THINK about taking on the ultimate being, I'm going to stress
that you complete _all_ the side quests. It's beneficial for you. Thank me
later. Not only do you get to level your characters up at least 10 levels,
but you can  also obtain the ultimate weapons  and armor for each character,
which you unquestionably  need. Until you  finish  the side  quests and extra
roundabouts, only then will you stand a chance  against Lavos.  Good luck and
don't let me down!

Recommended party: Crono, Magus, and a Healer.
Alternate party: Crono, Marle and Frog

• Innate abilities of the bosses*   Let me just say this to get it over with.
  Lavos mimics.                 :   Lavos in this form is hella easy. The
                                *   nature of his attack pattern is taking
:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:   the abilities of most of the bosses you
                                    have  already encountered, and mimicking
their every attacks. Lavos mimes each boss in  the order  you had encountered
them during your adventure. Is this  registering in your head? Good. While it
takes on the "form" of the boss, its stats will be equivalent  to that of the
boss he mimes. Therefore, making him an utter weakling compared to the
party's current strength. Lavos will have the same weakness, same strength,
and other stuff as  the boss he copies. After each  battle  you are given the
chance to re-equip, heal and regroup your party to match the next boss.
Sounds easy doesn't it? Yes, it does.  Here's the  order of the  bosses Lavos
will attempt to pathetically mimic:

      DragonTank                  Use physical attacks.
      Guardian/Bits               Use physical attacks.
      Heckran                     Use physical attacks.
      Zombor                      Use physical attacks.
      Masa/Mune                   Focus attacks on Masa (left).
      Nizbel                      Shock it with Lightning to lower DEF.
      Magus                       Attack with whatever Barrier it has.
      Tyrano/Azala                Equip your party with Fire-absorbing armor.
      Giga Gaia                   Destroy the left hand first and then body.

Following the battle with a weak form of Giga Gaia, you're forced to face the
actual Lavos. This is nothing compared to what's coming up. Use Magus' Dark
Matter, Crono's Luminaire, or any powerful dual techs you have.  He should go
down in  no time. Should  your party feel  a little sluggish, revitalize them
with a MegaElixir if you have one to spare.

• Protective Seal               *   damage to the entire party. At the start
• Shadow Slay                   :   of the fight, the body will cast Laser
• Shadow Doom Blaze             *   Beams and whither the party's HP to 500
• Evil Emanation                :   or less. Use a Lapis to bring it back up

                                *   has many, many attacks at its disposal,

                                    Blaze seems to be the most damaging. To
begin with, if you have Magus, it will abridge this battle and the next one
incredibly. Have him cast a continual assault of Dark Matter, while Crono can
alternate between Confuse and Luminaire. Get rid of the arms first. The third
party member should do the healing. Once the arms are gone, damage to the
body will have increased sufficiently, but the damage isn't at its full
potential. Every time it uses Shadow Doom Blaze, which should be no more than
twice, heal like crazy. If you can't bring the party's HP high enough, then
sacrifice a MegaElixir. I was only forced  to use it once. After you beat it,
it will strip down to its true form. The Lavos Core...

• Grand Stone                   :   luckily, this battle isn't terribly hard.
                                *   Other than the fact its attacks are more
:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:   powerful than  the last form, it has less
                                    HP. This form of Lavos is comprised of,
again, 3 parts. It deceives you into thinking that the central form is the
real target, when in fact, it is actually the right bit. The right bit is the
main target, but for now, its defense is up and you can't do much harm to it.

The crux of the problem  is that the  central bit  has powerful spells in his
magic bag and constantly intervenes with your attacking the real target. Like
I mentioned earlier, having enough MegaElixirs in hand is key. Start by
having Magus cast Dark Matter at an insane rate--as soon as it becomes
available. This will heal the left bit, but it doesn't matter much. Then have
Crono use Confuse on the central bit. The third  party member must constantly
heal and keep everyone's vitality up.

Once the central bit is gone, attacking both bits at the same time results in
a X-Strike-ish counterattack to that character. At this time, the right bit's
defense shield should have dissolved. Attacking it will now damage it
sufficiently. Use this chance to use your most powerful techs on the right
bit and disregard its counter attack.  The right bit has a little over 30,000
HP.

The Central Bit can be revived infinitely  as long as  the right bit is still
alive and kicking.

If you die, Lavos will destroy the world and the future will remain unchanged
regardless of your efforts. But if you managed to put Lavos in his place,
congratulations! You've just beaten the game. Depending upon what you did,
the "usual" ending may change slightly. Enjoy the ending. See "Extra Endings"
for help on how to obtain the other endings.

EXTRA LAVOS THRASHING

This strategy involves Crono, Ayla, and Frog. Ayla and Frog are by FAR the
two most important in this strategy.

First, for equipment, give Ayla the Prism Specs, and give Frog Sun Shades.

Then, what you have to do is let Lavos in ANY of his forms, kill either Frog,
or Ayla. When this happens, have Crono quickly use a Revive on them (the
potion that brings them to 50 HP) and then let them completely <edit> Lavos
with their suped up Frog Stomp/Dino Tail.

Each Dino Tail with this should do about 3500 damage, and Frog Stomp should
do about 2800 the first time around.

These will kill the second form before he can Shadow Doom Blaze twice, and if
you give Ruby Armor to both Frog and Ayla it won't do as much damage. If you
want to get them both to practical points for their attacks, just revive them
with Revives.

Since both Frog and Ayla's attacks are physical, they will affect both bits,
instead of just the center one. After the left bit is dead, and the center
bit is hurting, the defense on the core goes down. then just <edit> him some
more.

The core has exactly 30000 and the center bit has 10000 hp. After 2 rounds of
Dino Tail, and one round of Frog Stomp, the center is dead, and when the core
has about 20000 hp left, it revives the bits, but its defense stays down. so,
you just keep dong Frog Stomp and Dino Tail, and reviving when necessary, and
the core will most likely die before it has a chance to revive the other 2
again.

This has been done by me about 7 times to kill Lavos, and it works like a
charm. most times, both Frog and Ayla are hurting badly after the second
form, and are already ready to kill the final form as is. About 5 out of 7
times, the center and left bits die before they have a chance to kill either
Frog or Ayla completely. This strategy makes Lavos much easier to kill, since
it activates much more powerful attacks than any other strat.

As for the new game+ lavos trashing and thrashing, this is what I did:

The first thing I told about yeilds about 16 Megalixers. This should be more
than enough to keep Crono alive through the new game+ Lavos battles. Just use
Crono's Luminaire to kill both arms on second form, and then Confuse the
middle when its vulnerable.

On final form, Confuse the left bit to death, then Luminaire. With Crono at
high levels (48+) the major attacks shouldnt be so bad. Whenever you feel
like it use a Megalixer(you wont run out if you stole them from the
Ruminators) and continue the battle. It takes a while, and it helps to have
Marle(if you play your cards right, you can get her in every single Lavos
battle, including the Dream Project battle) cast haste on Crono. After one
shot of Luminaire, the center bit goes down in hp and the core deactivates
the defenses. Continue to haul off on them with Luminaire 'till the core
revives the left bit, and then kill it again with confuse. The defense on the
core should stay down if you kill the left bit fast enough, and then continue
to Luminaire. If you have hasted Crono, then you should be able to kill Lavos
before it can revive the bits twice. If you dont have haste, it takes twice
as long.

Megalixers are pretty much limitless against Lavos, if you stole them from
the Ruminators. If you don't get enough, you can ALWAYS do the Black Omen
twice, by defeating it 3 times, one in each era, and working your way back in
time. This yeilds about 40-60 megalixers and <edit>loads of HyperEthers if
you do all 3. The main idea is to charm from EVERYTHING in the black omen,
because almost everything in it gives up really good items.

Thanks to Andrew Kathan for this rather interesting strategy.

* * *

I found it much easier to beat the final form of Lavos, if you hit the left
pod twice in a row with Crono's Confuse, which will take it out, and then
use Dark Matter/Mist and Luminaire, to beat the crap out of what's left. The
other bit is, that I had Marle in my party as well, and the few times I had
the chance, I had her cast Haste on Crono, then Magus, then herself, if
possible.  This made survival a lot easier!

What do you gain by taking extra time to  complete these side quests? For one
thing, you're able to obtain the ultimate weapons for some characters, and at
the same time, unravel more of the story Square has put so much effort into.
You don't necessarily have to do  them in the order here. I'm merely  listing
them by the degree of difficulty.

Warp to the period 2300 AD and whip out your world map.  Fly to  the isolated
island in the south. On that island should be the Sun Palace. Be sure to save
and head in.


BOSS: SON OF SUN                                                   HP: 2100
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Flare,                                            Gained: 3500 EXP
         Flame Counterattack,                                        40 TP
         Laser                                                     2000 G

Son of a Gun, er, I mean Son of Sun is one of the toughest bosses ever. Don't
take him too lightly, or you're toast. If you can't see through his devious
weakness, then you have no chance of beating him. Here's the secret: The boss
is in fact, the being in the center, but  attacking him directly causes it to
suffer minimal damage. The trick is to attack the flames that encompass it in
order for it to be hurt sufficiently. However, the hard part is to guess
which one of the flames has the telepathy to transfer the damage to the
actual boss. Have each of your  characters  attack the  flames in a clockwise
fashion individually. If you strike  the wrong flame, it will  counter with a
devastating flame attack.

Once you find the weak point, assault it violently. Techs, physical and magic
attacks inflict the same amount of damage, so just use physical attacks to
conserve MP.  After a while, it will perform a Roulette Shuffle, which causes
the flames to be re-arranged, forcing you to hunt down the right flame again.
It doesn't sound too frighteningly difficult, does it?  The only thing you
should be worried about is its constant use of Flare, Laser and the flame
counterattacks, but if you have Ruby Armor or the Red Mail equipped, Laser is
the only threat. Note for the wise: Do not ever use a group attack, or you'll
be condemned to death.

---------------
Helpful Tip:

Equip your  characters with  armor that absorbs  or lowers fire damage.  Have
Magus in your party, and make  sure he knows Black Hole.  Why? When you start
the fight, have Magus cast Black Hole. It will swallow up two of Sun of Son's
flames, so instead of five flames to guess with, you only have three! This
makes the battle a lot quicker, and less painful too.

Thanks to Bahamut43 for the great tip.

After the long  and grueling battle, walk  up to the altar and  take the Moon
Stone. Take it to 65,000,000 BC and head to the secluded island in the north-
east. That is the Sun Keep.  Place the Moon Stone in its rightful place and
leave. Return to 2300 AD and go to the same place, the Sun Keep. Only this
time, the Moon Stone has been stolen! The lead character deduces that the
stone has been gone for some time now.  So travel  to 1000 AD. Alas, the Moon
Stone isn't safely tucked in this earth bed either.

Fly to the Mayor's Manor  in Porre to find a strange luster shimmering in the
sky above his house. Inside, the Mayor claims he's never heard of a Moon
Stone. Leave and stop by the Snail Stop across from manor and buy a Jerky
from the clerk for 9,900G. Now travel back to 600  AD and drop by the Elder's
House and give the woman  the Jerky for FREE. They will  be grateful for this
and promise to expound the importance of generosity to their children.

Back at the Mayor's residence in 1000 AD, he turns out to be an altruist this
time around.  He freely gives the Moon Stone back. Go to the Sun Keep and
place it in its proper place.  It is truly  amazing how a piece  of jerky can
amend several generations of greed!

For the last time, travel to 2300 AD and with Lucca in your party, pick it up
at the Sun Keep. You'll be taken to Lucca's House, where she will whip up a
neat gun for herself.  Her father collaborates as well with an invention of
his own, the [SUN SHADES]. That's it! The end of this easy side quest. If you
have the  Rainbow Shell  in your hands, you can make  more powerful  weapons,
using the mingled power of the Sun Stone and the Rainbow Shell!

Start off by visiting Choras, an island of its own off the southeastern coast
of the main continent. Go to the Café and speak with soda-guzzling man. He
mentions that his tools have been stolen and that he won't be able to work
without them. Toma's also here. After a small conversation, he gives you
[TOMA'S POP], which  will be used for  another side quest. Return to 1000 AD.
Stop by Choras  Inn and speak to the same  soda-guzzling man. His  name is in
the family tree somewhere. He claims to have the Tools you are looking for,
except he's too lazy to get 'em. Tells you to ask his wife instead. Visit the
last residence at the bottom. Speak to his wife and she'll turn in the
[TOOLS].

Take the Tools to 600 AD and find the carpenter again at the Café.  He thanks
you and leaves to return to work. You can find him at his residence in the
south. Speak to him and he'll call his team to work on the ruins. Follow them
to the ruins.

Upon entering, they tell that they've repaired what they could. It seems they
are bothered by the ghosts hanging around. If you promise to clean out the
infestation of the apparitions, they'll agree to come back. Clear out Reapers
and Defuncts in the right area and Sentries in the left.


   ________NOTE
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | Leave all the chests you find as they are. You should pick them up in the|
 | year 1000 AD and come back to get doubles! Like with the Mails and Vests,|
 | examine the sealed chests, but don't take what's inside. They'll upgrade |
 | to even nicer items in 1000 AD. Then, you could come back to pick up the |
 | as-good prizes.                                                          |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


Once you've dispatched every batch of the enemies, return to the carpenter in
his house. This time, he charges 2000G to repair the damages. Pay up and
return to the ruins. The repair team have patched up some of the holes, but
still have not finished them entirely due to the ghosts lurking about. Head
to the left room and go through the door that had been previously
inaccessible. Place Frog as the leader of the party. Inside  is the momentous
grave of Cyrus. Examine it to see its eulogy and for his ghost to appear.
Frog and Cyrus will be indulged by a sentimental reunion. After the sequence,
Frog's Masamune will be upgraded.

You have to again  return to the carpenter and pay up another 2000G for final
renovations to the Northern Ruins. Once they're done, explore the rooms in
the back and examine the sealed chests, but do _not_ take the prize inside.
On the way, you will meet some loose encounters with Base, a stronger form of
Shadow.

Finally, travel to 1000 AD and  visit the then-Northern Ruins, now called the
Hero's Grave. It will be free of monsters. Collect the treasures: [MOON
ARMOR], [SHIVA EDGE], and  the [VALKERYE] from the  sealed chests. There is a
[MAGIC TAB] near Cyrus' grave and a [POWER TAB] in the  bottom left corner of
the first room on the right. Finally, take the [HYPER ETHER] and [ELIXIR]
from the remaining chests and head back to 600 AD. Back at the Northern
Ruins, pick up  the treasures you've  tried so hard to avoid opening. Not bad
at all!

On the overworld in 2300 AD, fly to the  southeastern  continent to arrive at
what looks to be a construction site, but it is labeled Geno Dome.  Place the
humanoid robot, Robo, as the lead character and enter.  Once inside, activate
the computer for a voice to welcome Prometheus home. The computerized voice
prods the party to step inside. The party hops onto a conveyor belt that
teems with battles against the tough DeBuggest and Proto 4's. There are  five
battles in total, and each growing in numbers and difficulty.  Take note that
you can return here to level up your characters through the Dust Chute. The
enemies  will re-spawn and you can go through the nightmarish trip once again
at your leisure.

When you reach the end, the computer applauds your victory over its pawns. On
the other side of the door, find the only functional computer in the area and
defeat the Proto 4's. Switch the  computer on to learn more about the secrets
of Geno Dome. Go down and left to the room ahead. Defeat the Laser Guards and
head to the back panels. Leave the center switch green and the other two red.
This unlocks the safety latch on the energy pod. Return to the energizing pod
near the information computer and charge Robo. The pod channels strange
electricity to Robo, allowing him to force certain doors to open. Immediately
after being channeled with powerful jolts of energy, dash  back to the pod to
open the door on the left. The sudden  charge does  wear off after  about 5-6
seconds so don't linger behind.

Pick up the Poyozo Doll and search the orb for a [SPEED TAB]. Afterward, head
back to the south hall and press the switch next to the pod to open the
safety lock on the other pod. Then charge Robo and open the door. Claim the
[FULL TONIC] and [50,000G] from the chests in the room.  On the far left, a
Proto doll stands in your way and  deflects Robo from going any further. Head
to the opposite side and you may notice a shining dot in the chasm. That's
the Dust Chute, which leads right back to the entrance. Ignore that if you
don't want to re-live that hellish ride.  Head to the steel  door at the top,
next to the  conveyor belt, to pick up a [LAPIS] and [ELIXIR].

Find the elevator and take it to the  next floor. Ignore the door on the left
for now and head south. Have Robo face the control panel for the lasers and
he'll jump up to de-activate them. You  can pick up a [MEGA ELIXIR] and a
[MAGIC TAB] on the lower right. Back on the path, drop down the ladder and
take the [15,000G]. Continue north to learn a terrifying scheme. To the right
is a [FULL ETHER]. Backtrack to the save  point and go through the steel door
on the left this time.

There is a [POWER TAB] on the right. Take the  elevator at the end elsewhere.
Now de-activate the laser via the red switch. Move across the conveyor belt
and open the safety lock on the pod. Go back to the elevator entrance and
take a left. Flip the switch on the bottom to reverse the belt's movements.
The hard part now is to run from the charging pod to the pod on the other
side of the conveyor belt. The trick is to  immediately step out and run like
a nut once you see an iota of light. Inside the now-unlocked door, a Proto
doll starts to follow you. Slowly lead it back (it gets "stuck" sometimes) to
the Proto doll that had been blocking your way at the entrance.

When you reach the active Proto doll, the two lock-on.  Now, you could freely
take the [VIGIL HAT] from the chest and the last Poyozo Doll from the orb.
Make your way back to the  save point and SAVE. As you try to  ingress deeper
into the factory, a pink robot appears. This  gives obvious  indications that
the robot is female. Robo recognizes her as Atropos, but she doesn't seem too
fond of the party. Robo volunteers to fight Atropos alone.


BOSS: ATROPOS XR                                                   HP: 6000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Cure Beam, Prism Beam                                Gained: 0 EXP
         Atropos Tackle, Hammer                                       0 TP
         Punch, Area Bomb                                             0 G

Basically, she has all of Robo's tech skills. Fighting against yourself isn't
appealing, but fair enough, she is easy to do away with. Simply use Robo
Tackle throughout the fight and  use Cure Beam when necessary.  For the first
half of the fight, she mimics Robo's moves and uses them against him. But for
the  second half–-she uses  Area Bomb for the  remainder of  the battle. Just
keep Robo's HP above 150.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Atropos' memory bank restores itself upon that  awful whiplash and returns to
her once kind self. As a memento, Atropos presents Robo her favorite
[RIBBON], which automatically  augments Robo's stats accordingly. Continue to
the back and place the Poyozo Dolls on the two green orbs on either side to
open the double doors.  Prepare to meet the creator of your dear friend...His
real purpose is about to unveil itself.


BOSS: MOTHER BRAIN                                                 HP: 5000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Reprogramming, Laser,                             Gained: 3000 EXP
         Prism Beam,                                                 40 TP
         Power Wall, Lock tech skills                              3000 G

The three Displays accompanying her wake are major disadvantages to the group
and yourself. But luckily, they are easily taken care of. Destroy only TWO of
the three Displays. Force yourself to put aside the thought that it can still
heal the Mother Brain for 1000HP, but your group should be doing over 2500HP
worth of damage to the boss, practically counterbalancing the HP restoration.
Have two characters perform their most devastating Dual tech, while one
character pulls off his most powerful single tech. Each round should net over
2500HP total. Don't let up and she'll go down eventually. If you do happen to
destroy all 3 Displays, the Mother Brain  tends to get nastier and retaliates
with Reprogramming and a fatal, unnamed group attack that increases in damage
each round.

Need more help?

I found an easier way to beat the Mother Brain in the robot Factory in
2300AD. How I did it was to destroy two monitors and have Ayla and Robo use
Boogie to halt the remaining monitor. Then just wail away on the Mother
Brain.

Thanks to Shaun Austin


First have Lucca, Marle, and Robo on your team. I found the easiest way to
defeat the Mother Brain is to use Lucca's Hypnowave. It'll put all the
Displays to sleep (works 99% of the time) and will last the entire fight
(unlike Robo's and Ayla's Boogie). Just to be on the safe side, destroy 2 of
the Displays and leave the other one snoozing. Then have Lucca and Marle
constantly use Antipode 2 on the Mother Brain and she'll be down in a couple
of minutes. In addition, have Robo use Robo Tackle on the Mother Brain).

Thanks to Skyline R33
_____________________________________________________________________________


Upon being defeated, it drops  the [TERRA ARM] and [CRISIS ARM] for Robo. The
game takes  the party back  to the world map, where  they will take  on their

Ozzie's Fort is situated just east of Magus' Lair in 600 AD. You'll find it a
little smaller in size. Enter to find the ferocious big green guy waiting for
you. You might want to place Magus in the party for a slight change in the
dialogue. Ozzie no longer reveres the once wicked Magus. Now, he views him as
his arch enemy, a traitor. Follow him to the next room and he calls on his
underling, the she-he--Flea!  She acts in her (?) usual swanky manner, and as
always, battles the party.

It isn't a real fight, so it's not necessary to make a strategy for it.  Just
stick to physical attacks and she should die in 3 to 4 rounds.  Occasionally,
she'll try to underpower your party with her now-pathetic magic attacks. Upon
her defeat, she turn tails and flees, throwing  a hateful remark at the party
for defeating her.

Follow in pursuit and you will come to a room where Ozzie is at the end along
with...a switch. Looks like he still has some dirty tricks in the bag. He
attempts to sic 2 baddies on you, but they fall off and the music dies.  It's
comic relief, I say.  Having made him look like an idiot, he retreats to the
next room.  There he calls on Slash to take care of you. Deal with him the
same way you dealt with Flea. He's a piece of pie and it shouldn't be able to
sap the vigor out of you. Follow Slash' trail to the back room.

Don't try to duck past the moving switch blade; it'll leave your party with 1
HP if you get caught under it. Instead, make like you don't see it and leave.
An imp will come and screw it up. You can now get the [FULL ETHER] from the
chest unscathed. Before leaving, there is a  very well-hidden room just below
the doorway. You can find Magus' [DOOM SICKLE], [GLOOM CAPE] and [GLOOM HELM]
there, all of which are  valuable equipment. In the  next room, the terrible,
tone-deaf evil threesome appears to match wits with the party. This time,
it's no push-over. As they  announce their Charm items, prepare for a serious
beating...


BOSS: GREAT OZZIE, FLEA PLUS, SUPER SLASH       HP: 6000 (O.), 4000 (F./S.)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Delta Force, Bad Impulse,                         Gained: 7500 EXP
         Fire Sword, Prism Beam                                      80 TP
                                                                   4000 G

The points gained after the fight is a bit  misleading, as Flea can sometimes
vanish from the fight, deducting exp, tp and gold values. The notorious trio
can perform capricious triple techs, namely Delta Force and Bad Impulse, on
the party. Start off the fight by charming the Flea Vest from Flea if Ayla is
participating in the fight. The Ozziepants  are not worthy of the 4 MP needed
to cast Charm. If you're collecting weapons, charm the Slasher 2 from Slash.
Then focus all your energy on Ozzie and take him out of the ring first to
prevent any more triple techs. Next, concentrate on Flea and finish her off
quickly. She and Slash can do the Fire  Sword dual tech. Finally, sweep Slash
off the screen with powerful single and dual techs. Don't use triple techs as
they dissipate necessary MP.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Ozzie's two cronies die off, but  he still  manages to survive your onslaught
and dashes off into the room in the back. A similar fight to the one in Magus
Lair commences, where he summons a ice barrier to encompass him. Hit the
switches behind him, but no matter  which you choose, you still get dumped
into the previous room. Trail back to Ozzie and watch a common house pet
barge in and lend a helping hand. That's the  end of that. If  you check back
at Medina Village in 1000 AD, you'll find  that the  long-time grudge against
humans has  disappeared  and they  no longer  segregate  themselves  from the
outside world.

----------------
TONE-DEAF, EVIL FIENDS?

You know Ozzie, Slash, and Flea? Why do you think they're described as "tone-
deaf" fiends (tone-deaf being a musical term)? Reading your FAQ, an idea just
popped in my head. I believe the names of these villains is based on actual
musicians! Hear me out: Ozzie, of course, refers to Ozzie Ozbourne, the
infamous frontman of Black Sabbath and the guy who bites the heads off of
live bats. Slash is the inimitable guitarist for Guns N Roses. You know, the
bad mofo with the dark hair who always wears a big hat and sun-glasses. And
Flea, obviously, is the wacky funk-bassist of the ever-popular Red Hot Chili
Peppers. A stretch maybe? I'm not sure. As you may know, Square has a habit
of naming villains and other video game characters using real-life
references. For example, with Final Fantasy IV (II in the U.S.) the Four
Elemental Fiends are named after characters from Dante's Inferno trilogy
(very old and popular books written in Rennaissance Italy) according to the
designers. And of course, all the summons throughout the FF series (Ifrit,
Shiva, Leviathan) are named after characters from various real-life religions
and myths. And there are other examples which I can't quite remember. But
anywho, just thought I would sure it with you.

Thanks to John M.

The key item you need to initiate this side quest is Toma's Pop, which can be
gotten from him at the Café in 600 AD. Speak with him in the Choras Café, and
after the greeting exchange, he gives you Toma's Pop to hold onto, as well as
some instructions on how and when to use it. Travel  to 1000 AD  and you will
notice the West Cape to the western tip of the Choras continent.


   ________NOTE
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | You don't necessarily need Toma's Pop to do this side quest. The only    |
 | thing you'll miss out on is the name "Giant's Claw" on the overworld.    |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


Toma's grave is there. Apparently, he had gambled his life away in his search
of the Rainbow Shell. Inspect the gravestone, and the lead character
automatically uses the Toma's Pop on the grave. A silhouette of the great
explorer appears and  converses with the party. It discloses  the location of
the Rainbow Shell. After the brief sequence, look behind the gravestone for a
[SPEED TAB]. Use the Epoch to return to 600 AD and fly a little northwest to
come to the island Toma had  directed you to that is called the Giant's Claw.

Find Toma's Note on the ground. Head south to the exit.  You arrive at a very
familiar place. It's Tyrano Lair, except it's a wee bit different. Instead of
working your way from the bottom to the throne room, you have to move from
the throne room to the entrance at the bottom. Pretty scandalous. You can get
the lead character to sit on the regal chair for fun.

In the next area, the left chest contains a [SIGHT CAP], but when approached,
it silently calls forth monsters-–tough monsters. Be sure to charm a Ruby
Armor from  the Gigasaur if you don't already have one. Use Lightning2 on the
Gigasaur and Leapers. The Gigasaurs  execute a one-time  counterblow that can
damage the party for 100+. After claiming your prize, head to the cave
entrance on the right. You arrive  in a familiar room which is comprised of a
fossilized  skull head and three floor  switches. Step on the top, then left.
Laugh as the kitty drops below. Follow it and jump in the hole.

Step on the left switch to open the skull head.  Then go through it  and take
the [POWER TAB]. Head all the way down and out. Search for the [POWER TAB] in
the left corner and drop down the ladder to the [FULL ETHER] on the left.
Climb back up the ladder and curve around the pass. Fossil Apes will leap out
from the abyss and attack. Before leaving to the next area, there is a hidden
chest in the back that contains a pretty [BLUE ROCK].

Ignore the  top ladder and work  your way south. There is a  powerful [ZODIAC
CAPE] in the chest on the left and a [LAPIS] on the bottom right. Go through
the left skull and send the Fossil Apes to their hellish graves using the
floor switch. Take the [FRENZY BAND] from the left passage. Then go around
the other way and do the same to the other Fossil Ape. There are 2 Rubbles
here, who offer an insane amount of Tech Points, and they are incredibly easy
to beat. Examine  the right chest  in the next  room and your  party will get
dumped to the depths below.

Leave your confinements  and head left, all the  way to the entrance and pick
up the [POWER TAB] you may have seen earlier. Backtrack and go to where
Kino's cell had been--actually it's still there, but only Kino-less--and
enter the huge hole in the wall. Just  ahead is a  descendent of Black Tyrano
with a hint of fury in its eyes.


BOSS: RUST TYRANO                                                HP: 25,000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Roar, Flamethrower (2)                            Gained: 3800 EXP
         Devour                                                      40 TP
                                                                   2000 G

Tyrano is back and has embedded a grudge against your party. He's exactly the
same as last time except his flame thrower attack is a bit amplified. If you
are well prepared for his flame attacks, then you should be worried about his
"devour" attack. Well equipped meaning, you've got the Red Mail, Ruby Armor,
and the Red Vest on your characters. Each time he performs his flamethrower
attack, it boosts its power the next round. So, each time he uses it on your
party, it will be more damaging than the last assault. You should only need
to nurse the wounds of those wearing the Ruby Armor and those  that have been
eaten up by him a couple of times. Other than caring for your injuries, don't
let up on launching an  all-out massacre of powerful single and dual techs to
make him extinct for good.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Behind Tyrano is the  iridescent Rainbow Shell. As the  party marvels  at its
beauty, they discover that it's too heavy to be lifted by themselves. Run
south and the game will fade automatically, taking you back to Guardia
Castle. There, the king agrees to unearth the Rainbow Shell and store it in
the castle as a national treasure and  family keepsake. Now you know that the
shell is in good  hands, it's time to go back  to 1000 AD to lay claim to the
real prize.

Back at 1000 AD, place Marle in your party and enter the castle. You find the
Castle tightly guarded, and it seems you can't go to and from rooms at your
will. Speak with the guards to learn about the trial placed against the king.
It seems  that the king had sold the national treasure for some dirty money!
The hearing is now currently in session. Find the trial room and use Marle to
"talk" your way in. Inside, the king is completely abased and claims that the
Chancellor is trying to frame him! There's nothing you can do to lift the
tension off at this time but to  find tangible proof  that will open the eyes
of the jury members.

Head to the treasury in the basement to find the guard knocked unconscious on
the floor. Accost the two Gnashers and they will reveal the true scheme.
After you've put them out of their misery, continue all the way north while
claiming the treasures in the chests and clearing out the enemies that get in
your way. You'll eventually reach the Rainbow Shell. It is exactly the same
as it was 400 years ago. Marle finds and reads a letter from Queen Leene, who
teaches her the  moralities of  respect. Afterwards, chip  off a piece of the
Rainbow Shell to receive a [PRISM SHARD]. Bring it back to the trial room.

The guards still won't let you or the princess in, but Marle comes up with an
alternate method, although she insinuates that it's a little dangerous. Marle
jumps through the mosaic glass painting in the back and disbands the hearing.
She shows the Prism Shard to the court and the Chancellor no longer throws
any more accusations. Instead he becomes a little annoyed and reveals himself
to be a  descendent of Yakra  under the  guise of the  Chancellor! He desires
payback more than anything else...


BOSS: YAKRA XIII                                                 HP: 18,000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Blizzard,                                         Gained: 3500 EXP
         Drrrooo...                                                  40 TP
         NeedleSpin: Version 13                                    2000 G

He's not at all any difficult if you've equipped yourself with protect status
armors and accessories. He tends to afflict Chaos status on your party often.
Other than that, he is a harmless puppy, with the exception of his Drrrooo...
attack. It hurts...a lot. He delivers capricious attacks that should be
countered with deadly single and dual techs from your characters. If possible
maybe even a triple tech. Remember to keep your HP high; don't let it dwindle
below 200, or you'll be busy casting Revive the whole fight.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Yakra XIII is defeated and drops  a remnant of his rampage. You are  not able
to get it now, so you need to come back later. Witness the cheesy sequence
between the king and Marle. When you've regained control of the lead
character again, return to the sparkling dot Yakra left behind to receive the
[YAKRA KEY]. This key  unlocks the  locked chests  in one of the  room in the
right tower I believe. Inside contains the real Chancellor.

At this point, Melchior is  waiting for you in the  treasury with the Rainbow
Shell; go to him if you want good items. Speak to him and he gives you a
choice between a Prism Dress or 3 Prism Helms. Speak to him a second time and
he'll uncover  more of his abilities  and forge the [PRISM SPECS] and Crono's
ultimate weapon, the [RAINBOW]. This is only if you have the Sun Stone,
though.

First of all, bring  along Marle, Frog or Magus.  The enemies  in the  Sunken
Desert are impervious to any type of attack unless you cast a water-based
spell first. Now, go to the  sand pit in 600 AD near Fiona's Villa and enter.
You arrive in an underground sand cavern. Attempting to collect the treasures
scattered around the room result in enemy attacks.  Remember to  cast Ice2 or
Water2 at  the beginning of  each battle. Lay claim to the  various prizes in
the room and exit south. The north exit leads back to the entrance.

This is the boss'  chamber. The party  feels a  sudden  tremor and  catches a
glimpse of Retinite. Retinite makes periodic appearances. At this time, if
you are ready, run into him as he emerges from the ground to engage in combat
with the incarnation of Zombor.


BOSS: RETINITE                   HP: 5000 (Top), 1000 (Core), 4800 (Bottom)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Sand Cyclone,                                     Gained: 2600 EXP
         Absorb Energy from Core,                                   100 TP
         Devour                                                    2000 G

Retinite's attack pattern is very loosely based on Zombors.  Don't attempt to
use any Shadow-based attacks, as it will heal it. To kick the fight off with
an advantage, cast Water2 or Ice2  to lower its defense. Each time you attack
it, its defense slowly increases again, similar to Nizbel II. You may have to
re-cast Ice/Water every other round. Focus  on the upper  abdomen first and
ignore the core. Crono's  Confuse works  wonders  against it, as does  Frog's
Leap Slash.

Once the upper body  disintegrates, keep up with Crono's Confuse on the lower
pelvic bone now. The pelvic bone is known to eat up a character, consuming at
least 300HP each time. That is a major threat so don't let up your attacks.
Sounds inane, doesn't it? It's  Square logic. Once the  pelvic  bone is gone,
the core will die with it.
_____________________________________________________________________________


With the aftershocks gone, the party can pick up the great items in the room.
When you're done, head back to the previous room and  pick up the [POWER TAB]
on your way out.

Go to Fiona's Villa with Robo in the party. Fiona is  happy that she can work
on her flourishing, ideal forest, but she laments that it will take a long
time. She may not live long enough to see it. Robo volunteers to stay to help
out. Allow him to stay behind. On the world map, you see Robo working to make
the desert soil fertile.

Travel forward to 1000 AD to find that the  desert region surrounding Fiona's
Villa in 600 AD is now replaced by a green forest.  In the center is Fiona's
Shrine.  Inside the shrine are nuns who worship the great Fiona and Robo for
their hard work in making this land rich with life. One of the nuns is
selling helms and hats for a great sum of money.  Continue to the back of the
shrine to find a pooped Robo. The lead character drags him down and takes him
to Lucca to get him fixed.

At the bonfire, they discuss  the true  purpose of the Gates and if there had
been, perhaps, an unknown entity who had wanted them to see all that was
going on in the world: past, present and future.  Marle asks Lucca if she had
a particular time period in mind she wanted to return to. Lucca seems a bit
hesitant to answer, but Marle takes the hint and shuts up. The group
continues  to discuss the  endless  possibilities  into the wee  hours of the
night.

During the night, while everyone  is asleep, take  Lucca  to the  exit at the
lower right and open the unusual red gate. Lucca arrives at her house ten
years before--to the time of that incident which changed her life forever.
Don't exit to the  balcony in the south or you'll witness her mother's morbid
accident with  an inability to help. Instead, head down  the right stairs and
into the kitchen. Read Taban's note on the table to learn the password.

Next, leave through the  door leading to the  south. Re-live the  moment with
Lucca as she sees her mother become crippled. When you regain control of
Lucca, inspect the glowing dot on the machine and enter the buttons in this
order: L1, Circle, R1, Circle. The machine should  stop dragging Lara in--you
just saved her mother!

Afterwards, return to the campsite via the Gate in Lucca's room. Robo's there
when you arrive. Whether or not you saved Lara, he will still sweet talk you
and give you the [GREEN DREAM] he had made while plowing Fiona's fields.  All
is happy now.

The skyborne  fortress of Zeal, formerly  the Ocean Palace, can be found from
12,000 BC to 2300 AD, although the fortress in 2300 AD is locked. To enter
the floating fortress, fly under it until the text "Black Omen" appears, then
press action to enter it.


   ________NOTE
  /_________________________________________________________________________
 | As mentioned above, there are numerous enemy encounters ahead. Be sure   |
 | to bring along any characters that still need to unlock their techs. The |
 | monsters excrete lots of tech points. I learned Crono's Luminaire and    |
 | almost all of my character's skills in one trip through the Black Omen.  |
 |__________________________________________________________________________|


When you arrive at the entrance, the doors are guarded by Laser Guards, which
can easily be vanquished with Lightning2. Bring Magus along if you know
what's good for you. The dot at the tip prompts an option to return to the
Epoch or not. If you don't think you're ready, then leave now.  Otherwise, go
in. The moment you step in, Queen Zeal is there and brusquely greets you.
Without further ado, she  summons the  Mega Mutant  to finish the deed.  Good
timing.


BOSS: MEGA MUTANT                             HP: 4600 (Top), 3850 (Bottom)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Chaotic Zone,                                     Gained:  900 EXP
         Mutant Gas, Blacken,                                        50 TP
         Steel Steam                                               1500 G

Concentrate your attacks on the upper part first. He's an annoyance since his
attacks all afflict random status on the party. Other than that, he's easy.
Magus' Dark Matter will make short work of him.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Continue forward to meet some resistance by Peeping Dooms. Don't attack while
their shields are up. Keep heading north until you encounter a Boss Orb and
two Side Kicks. Don't attack the Side Kicks while the Boss Orb is around or
you'll experience serious whiplash. If you have Crono and his Rainbow, it can
put the Boss Orb in his place with one hit since it does critical 97% of the
time. The Side Kicks are a bit tough since you are bound to miss a lot.  They
are harmless but let up a lot of tech points if you kill them before they run
away.

Head all the way north while  battling enemy mutants and robbing chests until
you come to an orange telepod. Hop on to get transported to another part of
the massive fortress. Take the familiar elevator ride down. When you come to
a stop, step off the elevator and exit north.  Weave around the semi-maze and
get the [MEGA ELIXIR] from the chest and the [30,000G] on the platform. At
the fork, take the right path to collect a [MAGIC SEAL] and continue moving
north. You arrive in a room with a save point and Nus. Take the contents from
the chests and if you want, buy some items from the left Nu.  To continue on,
search the north wall to reveal a hidden door.

In the next area, you meet a Tubster. Use Ice Sword2 if possible to eliminate
it quickly. Continue onward until you come to a point where a line of fast-
moving Ruminators keep you from getting the [ZODIAC CAPE] in the chest. Bump
into them and kill them off quickly before they zap every trickle of your HP.
Then follow their trail to the room at the right. Continue going left and
down  to the  statues. Grab  the [POWER SEAL] from  the left  chest and  move
south.

------------
STOCKPILE SOME TABS AND MEGAELIXIRS

Once in the Black Omen, you can  get all the Power Tabs you  ever need.  When
you encounter a Tubster, charm it and get the tab. Exit the room and start
over again. That will give you an extra boost of power just before getting to
Zeal and Lavos. Need Magic Tabs? Charm the Aliens to get 4 more tabs.
Characters too slow? Charm the Panels for Speed Tabs, you can get near 15
tabs in all before the end.

Want lots of MegaElixirs?  Charm the Ruminators, you  know those  monster who
eat each other.

Thanks to Maverick Hunter

woweecool also suggests charming a few Gold Studs from the Flyclops.
------------

After the battle with the Cybot and  Martello, look in the lower right corner
for a partially hidden chest containing a [SPEED TAB]. Then head to the next
room and slog through battling tough Aliens and Blobs. Keep moving and work
your way around the confusing and overlapping paths.  You'll eventually reach
a save point, where you SHOULD save. Just ahead is the Giga Mutant.


BOSS: GIGA MUTANT                             HP: 5800 (Top), 4950 (Bottom)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Chaotic Zone,                                     Gained: 1500 EXP
         Mutant Gas                                                  80 TP
                                                                   2000 G

Throughout the battle, watch for his habit of stealing MP from each character
and inflicting various status effects upon the party. He's not very different
from Mega Mutant; just a remake of him, except only stronger. Dark Matter and
Crono's Luminaire are good bets to winning this battle cleanly and quickly.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Use the telepod ahead and take another elevator up. This time it's a peaceful
ride up. Battle through the endless fights until you reach four Panels.  From
this point on, you will have to survive five boss battles, each more
difficult than  the last. Equip your  characters with  the best equipment and
weapons. When/If you're ready, save and continue forward.


BOSS: TERRA MUTANT                           HP: 7800 (Top), 20000 (Bottom)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Chaotic Zone,                                     Gained: 2000 EXP
         Mutant Gas,                                                100 TP
         Life Shaver                                               3800 G

His third and final mutation is  a bit tough.  Its Life Shaver  attack brings
its victim's HP to 1. Use Dark Matter and/or Luminaire or Ice Sword2. Once
you eliminate the top part, the bottom part, which has  tons more HP, will go
with it.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Snatch the [WHITE ROCK] and  another [MEGA ELIXIR] from  the two chests. Then
continue north.


BOSS: LAVOS SPAWN                                                HP: 10,000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Lavos Spawn Needle: Disorder,                     Gained: 2450 EXP
         Blizzard                                                   120 TP
                                                                   2500 G

Apply the same method you used when you fought this guy at Death Peak. It
isn't any harder than the last encounter.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Exit north and you'll be attacked by five Panels.  Kill them for a save point
in return for services rendered. In the next room, you find clones of all the
characters in the party. At the end is Queen Zeal who doesn't seem too
impressed by the fact you've dug your way this far through her impenetrable
defense.  After much talk about Lavos and your doom, she finally shuts up and
attacks the party.

Recommended Party: Crono, Marle and Magus


BOSS: ZEAL                                                      HP: 12,000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Hallation                                           Gained: 0 EXP
                                                                     0 TP
                                                                     0 G

Before any of your party members reach the active point, Zeal casts Hallation
upon them, which drops all HP to 1. Take this time to redeem yourself and
heal until you are at full strength again. She will continue to use Hallation
periodically. The combined damage of Ice Sword2 and Dark Matter can put her
at bay within a few rounds. If all goes well, you won't  need to use any Mega
Elixirs in this fight.
_____________________________________________________________________________


Immediately after her defeat, she sics the Mammon Machine on you without a
chance to heal or save.


BOSS: MAMMON MACHINE                                            HP: 18,000
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Point Flare                                         Gained: 0 EXP
                                                                     0 TP
                                                                     0 G

Using magical attacks against it will raise its attack power.  Using physical
attacks raises its defense. Either way, you're giving him an advantage. While
it "modifies" energy, don't do a thing and spend a couple of rounds restoring
the party's vitality back to full strength from the last battle. Wait until
it releases its stored energy. When the text reads "Mammon Machine stands
still...", it's  time to unleash a  wave of magic attacks and powerful techs.
Attacking it at this time will neither raise his defense nor attack.  Perform
the usual Dark Matter, Luminaire, Ice Sword2, Spire, etc. Repeat this  method
and you shouldn't need to cure one too many times, unless it uses Point Flare
on a character. This is just a shadow of the upcoming boss...

---------------
Helpful tip:

If you have Frog equipped with the Masamune (normal or powered up preferably)
he can attack it at will and get healed by it (since the Masamune absorbs its
energy).

BOSS: ZEAL                          HP: 20,000 (Mask), 28,000 (Left/Right)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Attacks: Hallation, SkyGate                                  Gained: 0 EXP
         Hexagon Mist,                                               0 TP
         Dark Gear, MP Buster                                        0 G

The Mammon Machine disintegrates, and out pops Queen Zeal.  She uses the last
trickle of her power to transform herself into a more powerful being.

First of all, abstain from using any group attacks. Don't ever attack the
hands, unless you have more than an ample supply of MegaElixirs. You may have
to use about 4 MegaElixirs at the most  if you follow my method.  Her Hexagon
Mist is the most damaging of her attacks. You're going to need to heal
everyone right away after that attack. Designate  Magus as the item user.  He
should be feeding MegaElixirs and Ethers if needed. Then have Crono and Marle
perform their Ice Sword2 on the head _only_. Repeat this until she is
eliminated. It works because the  hands should remain inactive for the entire
fight if you don't provoke them.

---------------
DID YOU KNOW?

This is one rare thing  you can actually  get 3  MegaElixirs from Zeal. Charm
her TWICE and you'll get a MegaElixir each time, and another one for
defeating her. You get another one for charming the M.Machine. And you can
get yet another one if you charm Zeal's Head. Plus an extra bonus, you can
get a Prism Dress and a Prism Helm if you charm both of her hands, but be
sure to have Charm Top equipped on Ayla, so you don't get wasted by the hands

Thanks to Maverick Hunter

Following the battle, Queen Zeal finally reclaims her sanity and the fortress
of Black Omen crumbles. Lavos awakens at this point and you'll automatically
be taken to fight his first form.  See "Past, Present, Future and Beyond" for
details on how to beat him.

This section is littered with spoilers.   Don't read anymore than you have to
if you don't want your game ruined by me. I can do a damn good job too. You
have been warned for like the 4th time.


The first time you beat Chrono Trigger, meaning you've  resurrected Crono and
defeated the final boss at the last stage, you will attain the "Beyond Time"
ending. As you finish the game, stats, weapons and other accoutrements will
be carried over to a system called New Game+, where you will be able to begin
a new game with all the same stats and equipment as the previous game. New
Game+ gives you the opportunity to discover new secrets and further enjoy
Chrono Trigger to the fullest extent.  New Game+ powers the  replay value and
gives you an incentive to play it over and over again.  With this, you'll see
why Chrono Trigger is heralded by many as the best RPG ever.

The purpose of New Game+?  New Game+ is an unique system that  you need to be
able to acquire all other 12 endings of Chrono Trigger. That's right. This is
no joke.  Twelve new whole endings for the taking.  However, to trigger the
right one is the tricky part. I say this again and again–-That's what I am
here for!  And since you're at such a powerhouse state, you should be able to
breeze through your second, third, fourth, fifth and so on, playthrough. Does
this mean you have to start from point A to point Z? No, remember that bucket
at the End of Time? Well, that is a teleportation device that takes you
straight to the Day of Lavos any time you wish once you've visited the End of
Time for the first time. Or you could use  Lucca's ground-breaking  invention
at Leene's Square.

On the title screen, you'll notice an option known as Extra Mode. That is the
newest feature on the revamped Playstation version of Chrono Trigger. I'll
delve into  that in the "Omake" section ahead.  It contains clips and all the
anime sequences you've witnessed during the game. And you can watch them over
again in Extras Mode! Cool!

Before you go ending hunting, let me clear a few things up for you.  Although
equipment, stats, items, etc. have been carried over to the New Game+, your
characters, key items, Epoch, and other stuff you've obtained during your
quest have not. Why? It'll be major chaos for the game. Therefore, you must
play it again entirely to retrieve items and recruit members again. Yeah! Who
said it was _that_ easy?

How do I access New Game+?  It's giving you a heart attack isn't it.  On the
title screen, log into whatever slot your memory card is inserted into, and
move the cursor to the very top to reveal the hidden New Game+! That was evil
of Square to hide it there.  (Thanks to Brian Croyle for reminding me about
this.)

"Bad Ending"*

This is easily the easiest ending to perceive.  While fighting Lavos, let him
kick your ass. Upon your death, you get to witness Lavos' rage on the earth
and with that, the text "The Future  Remained Unchanged" appears  at the end.


"Beyond Time"
Extras Mode: New Game+, Endings

This is the "main" ending  everyone should get if they've followed everything
there is in the walkthrough. The King calls off the execution with the help
of Doan and King Guardia from 600 AD. A moonlight parade is played in Crono's
honor. Regain control of Marle and head towards Lucca at the top where it all
started. It's time for everyone to go back. Crono, Marle and Lucca see them
off and exchange goodbyes.  Afterward, Crono's mom  waltz into the scene with
the house cat, and she hops into the Gate as it closes. Looks like another
misadventure with Crono and co.  King Guardia presents Nadia's Bell, but gets
a little...preoccupied. The credits roll. Watch until the Playstation credits
to see the real bonus ending.


"Reunion"
Extras Mode: New Game+, Art Gallery, Monster Data: Present

Skip Crono's resurrection at Death Peak and go straight to battle with Lavos.
Crono must be dead in order to get this ending. Otherwise, you're back to
square one getting the "Beyond Time" ending. It's a pretty morbid ending, but
hey, if you like it. Have Lucca and Marle talk to everyone, but they all
refuse to help you revive Crono. But Marle won't give up until she finds him.


"The Dream Project"
Extras Mode: Triple Tech Showcase, Monster Data: Future

During New Game+, hop on the right pod of Lucca's invention to be transported
straight to Lavos. Defeat him on the spot to achieve this ending. Or...You
destroy Lavos at the Ocean Palace before Crono's mortifying death. The second
option is easier, but if you like a  challenge, it doesn't hurt to square off
with Lavos with Crono by himself. :) This is the illustrious developer's
ending!  It's pretty weird  because you get to meet and talk  with the Chrono
Trigger staff, disguised as the characters from the game.


"The Successor of Guardia"
Extras Mode: Single Tech Showcase, Monster Data: Future

After defeating Yakra, but before the trial of Crono's inane royal abduction,
use the right pod of Lucca's invention at Leene's Square. Defeat Lavos on the
spot to achieve  this yummy ending.  At Leene's Square, Marle will be treated
differently, but in a weird way.


"Good Night"
Extras Mode: Music Box (11-20), Treasure Map: Dark Ages, End of Time

On your first visit to the End of Time, use the  bucket before Gaspar has the
chance to tell you how to use it. Or...before the needed assistance at the
Zenan Bridge, use the right pod of Lucca's invention at Leene's Square.  Beat
Lavos from there to achieve this ending. Crazy monsters, crazy things.


"Legendary Hero"
Extras Mode: Music Box (21-30), Monster Data: Dark Ages

Before obtaining the Hero Medal from Tata, use the bucket at the End of Time.
Tata apparently has stolen the limelight of society from the real hero. For
those who have encountered the bug mentioned at the beginning of the FAQ,
here is a remedy for it. Major thanks to  Mike Weaver  for this. According to
him, you should  try using  Lucca's transportation device to  get to Lavos in
lieu of the bucket at the End of Time.


"The Unknown Past"
Extras Mode: Music Box (31-40), Treasure Map: Present

After you've taken back the Hero Medal from the wannabe hero, Tata, travel to
the End of Time and use the bucket to get transported to Lavos. From there,
kick his ass to achieve this unusual ending. It features the party stepping
out of the Gate in Medina Village and canceling all  the future plans to save
the world, skipping 2 periods in the process.


"People of the Times"
Extra Mode: Music Box (41-50), Treasure Map: Middle Ages

To achieve this  ending, you must trash Lavos after  retrieving  the Gate Key
the malevolent Azala had stolen from you. It features all the townspeople and
non-playable characters you've encountered throughout the game, like Melchior
and some soldier guy.


"The Oath"
Extras Mode: Music Box (51-60)

After Frog joins the party with the Masamune in hand, reach Lavos through the
bucket at the End of Time and defeat him. The endings shows Lucca repairing
the only humanoid robot  that needs repairing, Robo, while Crono and Frog are
dozing off. Sometime later, Frog goes off to Magus' lair by himself and tries
to single-handedly subdue him.


"Dino Age"
Extras Mode: Monster Data: Prehistoric Age, Treasure Map: Future

Immediately after you've defeated  Magus the first time, return to the End of
Time and defeat Lavos via the bucket. This ending features the entire human
race having been decimated by the Reptites.  Everyone  is a Reptite--and they
dominate all! Pretty hilarious...


"What the Prophet Seeks..."
Extras Mode: Dual Tech Showcase, Treasure Map: Prehistoric Age

Before Schala enters the Ocean Palace for the first time, teleport your party
to Lavos using the bucket. Defeat Lavos. Magus disguised himself as the
prophet back in 12000 BC if you didn't know already. Since the kingdom of
Zeal never fell. Everyone is still there! There are many cut-scenes featuring
Magus and Schala.


"A Slide Show?"
Extras Mode: Music Box (61-69), Boss Data

Watch Schala break the seal on the door  to the Ocean Palace and leave to the
End of Time without using the Mammon Machine to amplify your pendant's power.
This is an ending where Crono actually talks, which we are not very used to.
Lucca and Marle start to talk trash about all the guys.  Their lines are very
amusing, and the ending is just funny to watch.


* Not considered one of the twelve endings, but it's an ending nonetheless.

The first time you pop open the Extras Mode menu on the title screen, you can
choose to view the default easter eggs the game has already provided for your
young eyes; or unlock  them individually to evoke the best of  this new added
feature. When you enter Extra Modes, you are given the following options:

    > SLOT 1                      -  Loads a completed game file from Slot 1
      SLOT 2                      -  Loads a completed game file from Slot 2

Once you've finished the game at least once, you can load it to open neat new
movies and music clips, as well as unlock new features. To unlock these
features, simply complete the  game and  watch a certain ending no. to unlock
certain things. That's why it's important to finish the game with all 12 fun-
filled endings to get your money's worth. As you complete the game with a new
ending, new themes and fun stuff will become available.  That is what will be
covered here.

Menu options:

Theater  - Allows you to replay anime sequences you've experienced during the
game playthrough.  This option is unlocked by default. There are 13 movies in
all to gather and watch.

Music Box  - Allows you to replay  themes from the game you've heard through-
out the entire game.  There are 69 song clips in all to gather and listen to.
The Music Box is pretty  much an in-game original  soundtrack in itself, so I
listed the songs from the soundtrack to save me time.

You're wondering why  I have a shop list  when they are listed  at the end of
certain chapters  in the walkthrough, I know. Well, that's true, but the only
difference is that this is the _full_ list. Many were left out of the
walkthrough because they weren't fit to be in their corresponding "chapters".
So there.

Where can I get these amazing soundtracks?! Up your arse. Hahaha...You could
get them either online or at your nearest import store. They sell for 2039¥,
which is roughly 43 dollars if my unreliable memory serves me well, which it
doesn't. Animenation.net, Gamemusic.com, ebay.com, soundtrackcentral.com,
etc. are all good bets, although I don't know how comfortable you are with
ordering stuff online. Also, I don't know  about the original OST from 1995,
but the 1999 rendition is available at most import/online stores.

                                 |  XI. FAQ  |
                                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Do you update often?

 A: Whenever there is a need to update, I update. The latest updates can be
    found at GameFAQs.com. Please go there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: How do I get Magus on my side? I'm near the end of the game and I want
    to know if I can still recruit him...

 A: At the North Cape, when he challenges you to a fight, refuse his offer
    and start to leave. He'll join you then. If you missed this opportunity
    or if you've killed him, then uh, I guess you'll be Magus-less for the
    rest of the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: I don't understand how to get the Gold Rock at the Denadoro Mountains.
    I've searched high and low, but to no avail. Where the #@!% is it?!

 A: Place Frog as your lead character, and with the Masamune upgraded from
    the Cyrus sidequest, travel deep into the Denadoro Mountains until you
    come across the FreeLancer pelting rocks at you. Frog should catch one.
    Voila, the Gold Rock!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: I can't seem to get to the first Poyozo Doll on Death Peak. Whenever I
    try, I keep getting blown off.

 A: This is a common problem, I suppose. First of all, you need to have
    visited Belthasar one last time at the Keeper's Dome before heading to
    Death Peak. There, he will summon three Poyozo Dolls to assist you in
    Death Peak. They will meet you there, so head off. The first area is the
    most troublesome, as it has heavy winds that can blow you off the
    mountain. Wait until the furious winds have subsided and trudge as
    quickly as possible to the patient Poyozo Doll waiting ahead. It'll turn
    into a tree after you talk to it. Keep walking into the tree. That may
    sound kind of funny, but that helps keep you behind it. Use it as a
    barrier to protect you from the harsh winds. Then move on to the next
    tree after it abates. You should have enough time to reach each Poyozo
    Doll.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: The Playstation ending sequence is kinda confusing? Mind explaining it?

 A: Yes, I do mind, but if this is what will stop you from e-mailing me, then
    it has to be done. The Playstation ending shows the marriage of Crono and
    Marle. Then it switches over to Frog, as a human, and his subsequent
    knighting. It never shows his face. To further prove that this Glenn is
    not Glenn from CC, Frog has green hair, Glenn from CC has golden blonde
    hair. If Magus was in your party, you'll see a brief sequence of him.  It
    seems it's the last sequence with Lucca that's the most confusing. That
    baby she found is supposedly Kid, or a reincarnation of Schala. These new
    events lead to Chrono Cross. That's why they were added in the first
    place, duh!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: I can't find the sand pit to start the Sunken Desert sidequest. What did
    I do wrong?

 A: In order to partake in this sidequest, you must have told the girl in
    Zeal Palace to "secretly plant the sapling". If you missed that part, you
    can do that again in the Commons village after the fall of Zeal Palace.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Gaspar at the End of Time tells me that I have a person who needs my
    help and that I have to find her fast. Who is he referring to?

 A: From what I know, he is referring to Schala's mother at the end of the
    Black Omen sidequest. Her mother is being brainwashed by her own
    selfishness and lust for power. Therefore, when you defeat her, you'll
    set her soul free, or something.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Where is the best place for me to level up and get ready for Lavos?

 A: In the Black Omen, of course. Visit the Black Omen in each of the time
    periods before 1999 AD and you will be beefed up tremendously. Not only
    that, but I'll guarantee that you'll also have a surplus amount of the
    mighty MegaElixirs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q: So like, can you clear up the deal about Spekkio's forms at the End of
    Time?

 A: Sure thing, Timmy. You see, the earth-shattering  thing about Spekkio is
    that he (Spekkio is the guy who endowed your characters with great magic
    powers in the beginning) undergoes metamorphosis (as in changing forms)
    as your party levels up. Any long-time reader knows that I've accepted a
    slew of various contributions regarding his forms. That was a little
    confusing, as one contribution countered the other (sort of). So what I'm
    gonna do for you here is list all his forms and the levels you need to be
    at to see them. Of course, I couldn't have been able to compile this
    information myself without the help of the numerous contributors who had
    started it all. You can find their names at the bottom of this  document,
    under "Contributor Credits".

    Levels 1-9:    Green Croaker
    Levels 10-19:  Kilwala
    Levels 20-29:  Blue Goblin
    Levels 30-39:  Omnichrone
    Levels 40-98:  Masamune
    Level 99:      Red Nu

    The current level of the character at the lead of the party determines
    Spekkio's form. Strategies will not be provided for each form, so ha! If
    you really need them, you can find them in Phoenix 1911's EXCELLENT FAQ:
    http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/game/8914.html

_____________________________________________________________________________

I am more than exultant to have finally finished this guide. It turned out to
be much better than I had expected.  Please respect this FAQ and treat as you
would with your most prized possession.  I've put all my heart, long hours of
my life,  and much more into this, so it'd better make you happy.  I'm always
available for chat and stuff.  If you choose to criticize this guide, please
do it wisely. I will be more than happy to respond to valid criticism. As for
the less intelligent ones (e.g. uR FAQ suX! U sucK! UR a *****!),  those will
be laughed at and ignored.  Honestly, you must have better things to do than
send me that utter crap.

To those people who have sent me  endless e-mails about other things and I've
never replied, please don't think I'm ignoring you. I highly appreciate your
input and praise, but I just don't have the time to reply to every single
e-mail. Although, you may not hear from me know that I'm greatly appreciative
of your comments that help motivate me to do better.

Ok, I have run out of things to say, honestly. I won't keep you here anymore.
This concludes my great to superific Chrono Trigger FAQ. OK, get out. This is
the end. La Terminal or something in French. La Fin. ~fin~. The End. How many
times do I have to say this? Leave!
