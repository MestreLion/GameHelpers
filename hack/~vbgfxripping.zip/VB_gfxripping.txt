Yes, I앐 The_Fake_God yet with another tutorial (boredom to unknown limits). Well, lately I았e been diggin through my memories and something popped off my head (hopefully it wasn앖 my brain). I remembered the time I mailed SnowBro beggin him to teach me how to read graphics form roms :p Now I know why he didn앖 reply lol... I got a few mails asking the same so I decided to make this doc. If you find this doc interesting or useful, let me know. I앇 love to update it.


#The Basics#

I suggest you to read Klarth's Consolegfx.txt doc first (romhacking.org). Here are 2 basic concepts that you MUST know before going on:

BPP: Bits Per Pixel
Bitplane: "layer" where youre going to paint pixels, in certain order, depends on the format.

For example:

1BPP = 1 bit per pixel.
With one bit you can only represent 2 colors 0 or 1.

so an 8x8 1BPP tile would be somehting like this






00000000
01111110
01000110
01001010
01010010
01100010
01111110
00000000

See? One bitplane, 2 colors. Read Klarth's doc for more details.

#Writing the Program#

There are some basic steps you must follow in order to read/display graphics:

1) Read the byte
2) Convert the byte to binary
3) Mix the Planes to get the colors (if it압 more than 1BPP)
4) Paint

Now more detailed:

//1BPP Format//

This is the monochrome format, the easiest to implement one. In the included example, there's a file named example.gfx, that is a 2BPP "A" letter (from Lolo, in case youre wondering).

Fisrt Step: Read the byte

Since it압 too complicated to read individual bytes each time youre going to plaint a pixel, I used a static array of bytes.

//CODE//

' An array of 16 bytes
Global Tile(0 To 15) As Byte

//CODE//

Ok, those are 16 bytes. Why? Cauz it압 the size of a 8x8 2BPP tile, you can change the array's limits depending on the format your dealing with.

//CODE//

Public Sub GetTile()
 Open App.Path & "\example.gfx" For Binary As #1
  Get #1, , Tile()
 Close #1
End Sub

//CODE//

That's quite simple. Open the file, get the data and close. Now the information is redady to use.

//CODE//

' Monochrome Pallette
Public Type MPallette_
 Color1 As Long
 Color2 As Long
End Type

Global MPallette As MPallette_

Public Type Pallette2BPP_
 Color1 As Long
 Color2 As Long
 Color3 As Long
 Color4 As Long
End Type

Global Pallette2BPP As Pallette2BPP_

//CODE//

Since you need to add color to the graphics (could be the pallete of the rom youre hacking) I made those simple structures to hold the colors. 

1BPP Mode: 2 Colors 
           0 = Color 1
           1 = Color 2

2BPP Mode: 4 Colors
           00 = Color 1
           10 = Color 2
           01 = Color 3
           11 = Color 4

Why did I put those 1's and 0's together? Well, I앏l get into that in the next piece of code.

//CODE//

Public Sub PaintTile(Buffer As PictureBox, mode As Byte)
 ' Local Variables
 Dim curBit As String * 1
 Dim curBit2 As String * 1
 
 ' Position Index
 Dim x As Integer, y As Integer
 
 Select Case mode
  ' MONOCHROME
  Case 0:
   For y = 0 To 7
    For x = 0 To 7
     curBit = Mid(Bin(Tile(y)), x + 1, 1)
     Select Case curBit
      Case "0": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), MPallette.Color1, BF
      Case "1": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), MPallette.Color2, BF
     End Select
    Next x
   Next y
   
   ' 2BPP
   Case 1:
    For y = 0 To 7
     For x = 0 To 7
      curBit = Mid(Bin(Tile(y)), x + 1, 1)
      curBit2 = Mid(Bin(Tile(y + 8)), x + 1, 1)
      Select Case (curBit + curBit2)
       Case "00": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), Pallette2BPP.Color1, BF
       Case "10": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), Pallette2BPP.Color2, BF
       Case "01": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), Pallette2BPP.Color3, BF
       Case "11": Buffer.Line (x * 16, y * 16)-Step(16, 16), Pallette2BPP.Color4, BF
      End Select
     Next x
    Next y
 End Select
End Sub

//CODE//

First of all, I make an 8x8 loop (8 in y, 8 in X). Check this diagram out:

1BPP

BYTE#1: 00000000
BYTE#2: 01111110
BYTE#3: 01000110
BYTE#4: 01001010
BYTE#5: 01010010
BYTE#6: 01100010
BYTE#7: 01111110
BYTE#8: 00000000

Read one byte, convert to binary, paint. I used "Line" to create boxes instead of little pixels, like scaling the image.

2BPP

00000000
011111111
011222211
011222211
011222211
011222211
011222211
011222211
 11111111

BYTE#1: 00000000   BYTE#9:  11111111
BYTE#2: 01111110   BYTE#10: 11222211
BYTE#3: 01000110   BYTE#11: 11222211
BYTE#4: 01001010   BYTE#12: 11222211
BYTE#5: 01010010   BYTE#13: 11222211
BYTE#6: 01100010   BYTE#14: 11222211
BYTE#7: 01111110   BYTE#15: 11222211
BYTE#8: 00000000   BYTE#16: 11111111

Plane 1 - Byte 1 to 8
Plane 2 - Byte 9 to 16

The combination of bits #1 of Bytes 1 and 9 would make the first pixel, and so on.
