Updates:
10/01/2000 Added a bit of information about the speed data.

The most recent copy of this document can be obtained from the Tower of Bab-Il
(http://minitrue.weyland-yutani.net/tower/index.html).

This document uses normal bit order (bit 0 is the least significant bit).

This document details the structure of the records used for characters and
monsters both in and out of battle (as the latter is a simple subset of the
former). A record for a character or monster in battle is 80 bytes long; the
first 40 bytes of this is copied directly from the out-of-battle record when
the battle starts. When the battle ends the first 40 bytes of the battle
record for each character is copied back to the out of battle character
record.

An asterisk (*) before a description for the data indicates that only records
for characters have or use that type of data (equipment is a good example of
this). Two asterisks (**) before a description for the data indicate that only
monsters have or use that type of data (creature type data, for example).
Three asterisks (***) after a description of the data indicates that the
reader is requested to refer to the monster data document for a more complete
description (again, the creature type data is a good example).
