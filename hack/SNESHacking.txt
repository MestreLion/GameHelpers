This document explains how to hack a Super Nintendo
(SNES) game ROM.  When I say "hack", I mean that you
will be able to change a SNES ROM (or game) to
permanently include the effects of most Game Genie 
codes!  Which means that every time that you play the
game that you hacked, you would get the effects of the
GG codes, but you wouldn't have to enter any GG codes! 

One good use for this is if you are using an emulator
that doesn't support Game Genie codes.

The method that I describe here should work on most
games and with most Game Genie codes, but there may
be some exceptions.

It's also a very good idea to make a copy of the ROM
before you make any changes, just in case.

Here is a list of what you'll need:

1) A copy of SNES9x (a SNES emulator).  You must use
   SNES9x for this method.  You can find the latest
   version of SNES9x at: zophar.net

2) The ROM of the game you want to hack.

3) A hex editor (I use Hex Workshop v 2.54).  You can
   get a free trial version of Hex Workshop at:
   http://www.bpsoft.com/

4) A copy of ggconvc (which is a Game Genie to hex
   conversion program).  You can get a copy of it from
   my website (in the "Download" section):

All right, now that you have everthing you need, lets
get started....

The first thing we need to do is to figure out if the
game is a "LoROM" game, or a "HiROM" game. The easiest
way to find out is to start playing the game with the
SNES9x emulator.  When you load the game and it first
starts, look at the bottom of the screen and it will
tell you if it is a LoROM, or a HiROM game. 

Since LoROM games, and HiROM games each need different
methods to hack the ROM, I will use two different
explanations.  If you have a LoROM game, keep reading,
but if you have a HiROM game, then skip over this next
section and find the section for HiROM games.

====================================================
   LoROM games
====================================================

For this example, I will be using a Game Genie code I
made for Super Mario All-Stars.  The Game Genie code 
is: DD86-6F80.  The code lets you have multi-jump
ability in the Lost Levels part of the game. 

What we want to do is to convert the Game Genie code
into a ROM address, then we can go to that ROM address
and change the value there to the value of the Game
Genie code.

Enter the Game Genie code into the Game Genie to hex
conversion program (ggconvc).  For this example, we 
will use our All-Stars multi-jump code (from above).
When we enter DD86-6F80 into the conversion program,
it will show you a hex code, but ignore the hex code
for now.  After you enter in your Game Genie code,
press the "Show 64k" buttom.  You will see 2 sets of
numbers appear to the right.  Write down the lower
(bottom) number.  The number should have a colon (:)
in it.  In our example, the number is C6B286:00.

When you do the hex math (below), ignore the last two
digits of the number (the 2 digits to the right of
the colon).  So C6B286:00 becomes C6B286.  But make
sure you have those 2 digits written down, because you
will need them a little later on (in this example, the
2 digits are 00).

Next, subtract $C00000 (hex) from the number you wrote
down.  You can use the Windows calculator to do the 
hex math for you.  So in this example, we get:
C6B286 - C00000 = 06B286.

Now, add $200 (hex) to the number.  So we get:
06B286 + 200 = 06B486. This is the correct ROM address!

Write this number down, along with the 2 digits from
the original number you wrote down (the 2 numbers from
the right of the colon).  So the two sets of numbers
we now have (in this example) are: 06B486 and 00.  The
first number (06B486) is the ROM address, and the
second number (00) is the value that we are going to
change the ROM address to.

NOTE: Instead of subtracting $C00000 and then adding
$200, you can save a step by just subtracting $BFFE00.
I show it in 2 seperate steps because hex math is a
little confusing to some people.

Next, open the game ROM (in this example, it's Super
Mario All-Stars) with your hex editor.  Find the 
address that you wrote down (in this example, it's
06B486). 

Now, change the value at that address (in this example,
it's F4) to the value that you have written down (in
this case, it's 00).  So we just changed the value at
06B486 from F4 to 00.

Make sure you make a back-up copy of your ROM before
you make any changes, just in case something goes wrong.

Now, if you play your hacked copy of Super Mario All-
Stars on any emulator, Mario (or Luigi) will always have 
multi-jump (only on the "Lost Levels" part of the game)
all of the time, without having to use any Game Genie
codes!

This method may not work on every LoROM game, or with
every Game Genie code, but it should work on most.


====================================================
   HiROM games
====================================================

For this example, we will be using a code I made for
Seiken Densetsu 3 (Secret of Mana 2).  The code is:
FB78-8065 and it changes Duran's Vitality from 5 to 25.

What we want to do is to convert the Game Genie code
into a ROM address, then we can go to that ROM address
and change the value there to the value of the Game
Genie code. 

Enter the Game Genie code into the Game Genie to hex
conversion program (ggconvc).  For this example, we
will enter FB78-8065.  The conversion program gives us
a hex code: D13EB2:19.  Write this number down.

The first part of the code (D13EB2) is the address, 
and the second part of the code (19) is the value.

We need to modify the address part of the code before
we can use it.  Here's how:

First, we need to subtract $C00000 (hex) from the
address.  So here's what we get (in this example):
D13EB2 - C00000 = 113EB2.

You can use the Windows Calculator to do the hex math
for you.

Next, we need to add $200 (hex).  Here's what we get:
113EB2 + 200 = 1140B2.  This is the right ROM address!

Write this number down along with the value part of
the code (which was 19).  So (in this example) we have
the ROM address: 1140B2, and the value: 19.

NOTE: Instead of subtracting $C00000 and then adding
$200, you can save a step by just subtracting $BFFE00.
I show it in 2 seperate steps because hex math is a
little confusing to some people.

Next, open the game ROM (in this example, it's Seiken
Densetsu 3) with your hex editor.  Find the address 
that you wrote down (in this example, it's 1140B2). 

Now, change the value at that address (in this example,
it's 05) to the value that you have written down (in
this case, it's 19).  So we just changed the value at
1140B2 from 05 to 19.

Make sure you make a back-up copy of your ROM before
you make any changes, just in case something goes wrong.

Now, whenever you play a game with your hacked ROM, the
change will always be there, without having to enter 
any Game Genie codes!  In our example, if you start a
new game of Seiken Densetsu 3, Duran's Vitality is
increased from 5 to 25 (without any Game Genie codes).

This method may not work on every HiROM game, or with
every Game Genie code, but it should work on most.


Well, that's it.  I hope this helped some.  If you
