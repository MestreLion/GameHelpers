1) Tips And Tricks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Games 
To play the bonus games at any time, hold Select and press X, X, Y, B, A on the 
map screen. A menu will appear with all of the mini-battles, two of which can be 
played against another person. 

Bonus Levels 
At the end of every world there are two question mark boxes. When you get a 100 
on every level on that world those two levels will appear.

Extra Lives on World 1-7 
For nearly unlimited lives in world 1, try this: 

Grab one of those baddies that roll up in a ball. 
When you get to a point where you see the middle ring, don't go to it. Instead, 
go to the other side of the pipe that you just went pass. 
When shyguys start coming out the pipe, spit the ball out. 
Grab the ball before it stops rolling. Repeat the same process over and over 
until you gain some men. 
If you wait until the ball stops you'll have to do the process again. The same 
thing goes if you destroy the ball and you'll have to grab another one. 
Another problem is if you're not standing on the right spot. If you're not, the 
ball will go over the pipe instead of bouncing back and forth between the pipe 
and the stuff you can destroy with your eggs or by ground pound.

Extra Lives on World 4-1 
To gain all the lives you want, try this: 

On Stage 4-1 (with at least 3 eggs [maximum 5 eggs]), grab a shell. But do not 
make a egg out of it. 
When you get to a point where there's two tunnels with piranha plants, kill the 
plants with the eggs. 
Stand on the tunnel facing the pipe with the shyguys jumping out. 
Make sure that the shyguys are jumping out the tunnel. Then spit the shell out. 
The shell should go back and fourth between the shyguy pipe and the pipe that 
you're standing on killing the shyguys coming out the pipe. 
Be careful, because if a shyguy is standing too close to a pipe and the shell 
hits it, the shell and the shyguy will be destroyed. 

Find a Hidden Beanstalk 
When you are on level 1-7 at the end after you have gone through the tunnel, 
there is a log. Go to the top tip of the log and jump. Then a bouncey ball will 
come out. Jump on that and you will go up. Then go to the left and roll the 
rock. A question mark will appear hit that and you will go up a beanstalk. 

Hidden Door 
In Sluggy the Unshaven's Fort, go in the door at your left at the start. Next, 
use a POW or ? bubble item. A door will appear. Go through it to recieve a 
secret code!

Raphael's Train 
On level 5-8, most people cannot get 100 points because they're missing a flower 
and a few red coins. To find these, get to the second rotating wooden beam, and 
jump in the gap between the beam and solid ground. You'll find a train room. 
Hold Y to accelarate, and drive around the tracks to collect a flower and some 
red coins.

3) Boss Guide
----------------------------------------------------------------------

World 1-4 
The start of the easy bosses begin! Here you need to hit the big dope
with 6 eggs, and simply move around to avoid him jumping on you. If you
run out of eggs the eggplant nearby can assist you.

World 1-8
VERY Similar to the before boss, six hits again, only this time yellow
slime guys fall form the ceiling trying to hit you, which you in turn,
can eat for ammo. Very simple, if the first boss was easy.

World 2-4
Here you battle a ghost, and as we all know from the days of mario, a
ghost will 'dissapear' if you look at it. So, look away, and bank an egg
at the guy. He gets bigger and bigger so watch out, you can also use the
bats for ammo. 5 hits will dipose of him.

World 2-8
Strangely, this is the easiest boss in the game, and you don't even need
eggs! All you have to do is push it off the cliff before it pushes you off.
It's you against two shy guys, so you know this is an easy fight.

World 3-4
This is fun, but yes, easy. You are INSIDE a frog's throat, and you have to
hit the little ball at the top. Simply dodge the incoming food, turn the shy
guys into eggs, and instand ammo. Eight hits will make lil' froggy croak!

World 3-8
Very similar to the boss in 2-4. Here you must his a pihrana plant THREE times
on the band-aid on it's naval. Use the water skimming trick you learn earlier in
the game.

World 4-4
This is pathetic. Here you face 2 huge kirby like creatures, slam them to make
smaller creatures, those to make them even smaller, etc, etc. Really sad, as 
they
don't attack, just walk around.

World 4-8
Kinda fun, really easy. You need to hit this turtle 3 times before he'll crack.
To hit him, hit him 3 times with an egg to flip him on his backside. Then, slam
him once, which is a 'hit'. Repeat three times to win. Also, bounce on his small
head and he will cough out eggs.

World 5-4
Yawn, do i really have to write this up? Ok, there is an eggplant nearby for 
eggs,
and you have to repeatadly hit the blubber guy until his heart is exposed, which 
you
must then hit. Repeat this 3 times, and he's dead. Oh well, there's always 
bowser...

World 5-8
Ahh there is nothing more fun than killing an pudgy, ugly crow on a small globe.
Nintendo IS creative, that's for sure. All you have to so is pound posts in so
they appear on the other side, and hit Rapheal. This is fun, but easy, as usual.
Oh well...

World 6-4
Another easy one. Here you need to destroy the blocks over the lava with eggs,
therefore causing the big tin can to fall in. Really simple, especially since
you've made it this far!

Final Boss - Baby Bowser
Bowser is divided into three stages, and presents a small challenge thankfully!

Stage 1
The easiest stage, here bowser takes 3 hits. You must slam the ground to make it
go up and down, making bumps, that hit the baby king. Three times and it's onto
the second stage.

Stage 2
Now bowser is REALLY big and really mad. He will throw rocks on the platform you 
are on, making it really small. Get the eggs that float around, and hit him. It
takes a while to get used to the different aiming, but you shouldn't have too 
much
trouble. After a few hits, it's onto the final stage!

Stage 3
Now he's really pissed, and moves even FASTER. If that isn't enough, he throws 
MORE
rocks, making the platform you are\were on virtually non-existant. Hitting him 
is 
the same, only you have MUCH less time as he is quicker, and you have to be VERY
careful not to fall off the minute platforms. After a bit of this you'll win, 
and 
get to watch the cheesy ending, oh well, it was a cheesy game!
