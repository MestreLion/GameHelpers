1.0 Game Mechanics
--------------------------------------

    The basic gameplay is very simple to learn, despite the difficulty of the hardest 
songs. The game is played with four primary buttons, one representing each direction on a 
control pad (up, down, left, and right). By default, these four directions are represented 
by a dance floor (and there is a special dance controller which acts as this). Otherwise, 
you can simply use the directions on your control pad to play (as well as the four face 
buttons, which also represent these same four directions). On your side of the game screen, 
you will see these four arrows indicated at the top in gray. During gameplay, flashing 
arrows (called "steps") will move slowly from the bottom of that "column" up to the top 
where your arrows are. The basic premise is to hit the correct direction's button whenever 
the flashing arrows meet with the arrows at the top.

    You must listen to the rhythm of the song as well, because the simple sight of the 
arrows can't always tell you exactly when to hit each step. You have a "dance meter" which 
increases as you do well in the song. It will decrease as you miss steps. If it empties, 
you lose. The steps of the song will generally follow the bassline that can be heard. In 
the tougher variants of a song, however, the steps may follow the song's lyrics or other 
sound effects. Either way, knowing and listening to a song will help you greatly with 
performing the steps. There are also common patterns of steps that are very important to 
identify and learn. There will never be more than two arrows to press at the exact same 
time (since you only have two feet), but the notes can go extremely quickly (to as small as 
sixteenth notes).

    -Step Rank. Each time you press a directional button, the game will keep track of how 
close to the exact step you were. They are listed in order from best to worst. "Perfect" is 
right on the beat, and "Great" is extremely close. "Good" is close to the beat, and "Boo" 
is far off. "Miss" is what you get when you totally miss the beat or just don't even input 
anything at all for it. Each of these five possibilities yields more points than the one 
before it. At the end of the song, you see how many of each rank you received when 
executing the song's steps. These are tabulated towards your score. The possible step 
ranks, along with their associated color, are as follows:

              Perfect :  Yellow
              Great   :  Green
              Good    :  Blue
              Boo     :  Pink
              Miss    :  Red


    -Combo. When you achieve a streak of terrific steps, the game will display the combo 
counter on your screen. This basically tells you how many "greats" or "perfects" you have 
gotten in a row. Additionally, getting a higher combo results in higher points for each 
step you make within it. If you mess up, and get a "good" or worse for any arrow... the 
combo ends. Getting a combo throughout a full stage will get you the best letter grades and 
score. Additionally, the arrows on top will indicate whether a step was added as part of a 
combo (the arrows will disappear after you hit them if they were great or perfect, while 
they will simply pass above the top of the gray arrows if they were worse than that).

    -Grade and Score. You receive a score at the end of the level, depending on how well 
you did. Better step ranks get you more points per step, and longer combos will multiply 
your score for each step, depending on the length. Along with your score, you receive a 
letter grade which tells you how well you did. These range from "E" (worst) to "A" (best), 
and then to "AA" for perfection. You get an "A" now if you did a combo for the entire 
level, from start to finish. It takes coordination as well as a sense of rhythm to play 
this game well, especially for the later levels. You can set high scores for each of the 
game's songs, and for each variant of the song. These are kept (along with your letter 
grade for each) in the records section. This also gives an incentive to play again, to earn 
an "A" on every level variant. The possible level grades in this game are as follows:

               E  :  Failed
               D  :  Poor
               C  :  Fair
               B  :  Good
               A  :  Great
              AA  :  Perfect


    -Song Difficulty. Each song in the game has a difficulty level associated with it. In 
addition, there are multiple variants of each song (each with more steps and difficulty, 
see other sections). Each song has a different difficulty for each of its variants. You can 
see the difficulty level below each song disc that you can select. The difficulty level 
itself is indicated by how many "feet" markers you will see, as well as a title for that 
difficulty level (each level of difficulty has a title that indicates how tough it is). 
These difficulty levels are in relation to the other levels in the particular game, and a 
specific level's difficulty number can always change if it appears again in a later DDR 
title. The difficulty levels, along with how many footmarks each represents, are as 
follows:

              1: Simple
              2: Moderate
              3: Ordinary
              4: Superior
              5: Marvelous
              6: Genuine
              7: Paramount
              8: Exorbitant
              9: Catastrophic



2.0 Options Menu
--------------------------------------

    The Options Menu in Dance Dance Revolution is completely in English, and therefore it 
should be self-explanatory in most any case. However, certain options may be earned through 
fulfilling certain objectives or might be difficult to understand. Various options will 
change the way that the gameplay operates, while others will be cosmetic changes. Any 
option choices that show up in a shade of Green are the "default" setting, while any other 
choices will show up in White just like the options themselves. The full set of menu 
options is as follows:

    -Sound Option
        -Sound: Stereo/Monaural

    -Exit



3.0 Game Mode
--------------------------------------

    This is the primary mode of the game, and it's the place where you will spend most of 
your time. You must first choose your "play option," which determines how many players will 
play the game. You can also choose which "variant" of the levels you will play. And 
finally, you can decide which "effects" you want to take place on the level. The variant 
can be chosen on the stage select screen, once a song is chosen. You can choose the effects 
that you wish to use by pressing the "select" button at the screen where you choose the 
stage to play as well. This takes you to the "Effects Menu" where you input the codes and 
exit the menu in here by pressing "start." (and of course, when playing a 2-player game, 
both people can choose different sets of variants and effects for themselves).

    -Play Option: Three choices "Single," "Versus," or "Double." Single mode is the 
standard one-player game. Versus mode is where the two players compete to earn the highest 
score (and become winner through that). Double mode lets one person play with both 
controllers (yes, so they have to do double duty, worrying about eight arrows). Double mode 
has its own difficulties and step variants for each song, as well as three more slots in 
the records table.

    -Character/Genre: Eight Choices. The songs in the game are separated into eight 
different genres for ease of use. When beginning a game, you select which genre you will 
play your three songs in. There is a male and female character for each genre, to represent 
players one and two respectively. Note, though, some songs will appear in more than one 
category. The Genres "Group1" and "Group2" will eventually contain all of the game's fifty-
four songs within them (split in half, alphabetically). There is also a game option for 
"all music mode" which will simply put all the songs onto one list and let you choose any 
character you want. But otherwise, this is how they are separated:

       -Genre                 -Player 1        -Player 2

        Group 1                Robo 2000        Maid-Zukin
        Konami Original        Konsento:03/2    Devil-Zukin
        Variety                Johnny           Jenny
        Pops                   Rage             Emi
        Calorie Burner         Astro            Charmy
        Fun Factor             Boldo            Tracy
        Special Selection      Izam             Ni-Na
        Group 2                Akira            Yuni


    -Variant: Three choices "Basic," "Trick," or "Maniac." Basic is the default set of 
steps (arrows) for a level. This is the easiest choice of the bunch. Trick is a bit harder 
and has more steps in it. Maniac is the hardest and has the most steps of all. Think of 
those as the easy, medium, and hard variants of each level. In addition, there are these 
same three variants in use for "Double" mode, and it gets its own three extra spots in the 
records table (making a total of six scores for each song).

    -Effects: Nine effects in separate sets "Flat." "Little." "Left," "Right," "Mirror," or 
"Shuffle." "Hidden," "Sudden," or "Stealth." Little mode and Flat mode are both in their 
own separate category and can be turned "On or Off." The middle four choices are "turn" 
choices, and can be used one at a time. The last three are "hidden" choices, and can also 
be only one at a time. It goes as follows:

        -Flat: Off/Flat
        -Little: Off/Little
        -Turn: Off/Left/Mirror/Right/Shuffle
        -Hidden: Off/Hidden/Sudden/Stealth

        For all of the Turn choices, this will change the directions of all the "steps" 
(flashing arrows that come from the bottom) in the level. The gameplay remains unchanged. 
In Mirror mode, the steps in the level will be reversed to their opposite. In other words, 
for the arrows, left and right get switched, and up and down will get reversed as well. 
Left mode will rotate the position of the arrows 90 Degrees counter-clockwise (for the 
arrows, left becomes down, down becomes right, up becomes left, and right becomes up). 
Right mode will rotate the position of the arrows 90 Degrees clockwise (for the arrows, 
left becomes up, down becomes left, up becomes right, and right becomes down). Shuffle mode 
will randomly change all the steps in the level to a different direction.

        Little mode eliminates any steps that make a half-beat or smaller (in other words, 
the level will only have single-beat steps and therefore be much easier. However, this also 
obviously lowers the maximum score that you can get). Flat mode changes those multi-colored 
arrows that you usually see into arrows of all the same color (like they were in the older 
DDR games). Conversely, the "SSR Mode" in this game uses Flat mode by default. In that 
case, you can change the option to "Vivid," which will make the half-steps and other arows 
multiple colors (like in normal mode) which is easier to follow.

        Hidden options will mask the arrows (make them disappear) for a particular amount 
of time when shown. Hidden mode will cause the arrows to slowly disappear once they reach 
the top half of the screen (so you must follow the lower part, as well as the beat, to stay 
alive) while Sudden causes them to diappear when on the bottom half of the screen (so they 
seem to appear more suddenly). The Stealth mode causes the arrows to disappear completely 
(so you must know what they are in advance, as the game does not tell you). Also, as a 
note, neither the Left, Right, nor Shuffle modes can be used with "Double."



3.1 Solo Mode
--------------------------------------

    This mode contains "six panel" gameplay, which is the special setup found in the 
spinoff "DDR Solo2000" (and was later added into 4th Mix as an optional play mode as well). 
The difference in this mode, is the addition of two "diagonal" buttons, "up-left" and "up-
right." They are located to the sides of the "up" button on the special arcade dancefloor, 
and in the same position on the classic dance mat controller. It will use the "circle" and 
"X" buttons as the diagonals if you choose to use the dance controller. Otherwise, the 
diagonals will be set to the "L" and "R" buttons. You must choose which controller you use 
in the "Play Option" screen that you see first in this mode.

    The gameplay is set up in the center of the screen, as only one player can play this 
mode anyhow. The standard arrows will be colored yellow, while half-steps and smaller will 
be blue (similar to how the normal game mode has the "vivid" colored arrows to help you). 
There are three variants for each song in this mode, same as usual (Basic, Trick, Maniac). 
They will get their own segment on the records screen, bringing the total number of records 
per song to Nine (including Standard, Double, and SixPanel modes... three variants each). 
The game setup, genres, characters, number of stages, and all other general aspects will 
remain the same as in Game mode.



3.2 Link Mode
--------------------------------------

    This is the alternate to the usual "Play Option" screen that comes up when you start a 
game. When you are given your play options (number of players, or double) hit the "right" 
button twice rapidly to switch to Link mode. Conversely, hit "left" twice quickly to go 
back to normal Game mode. This also applies to Solo mode, and the same choices will be 
available. The purpose of this screen, however, is to access the "specialty" versions and 
setups for the game's songs. "Nonstop" mode is specific courses of four songs each, which 
are played straight through. This is explained moreso in its own section later. This, along 
with the other two segments, were normally found elsewhere in previous DDR games (but are 
now grouped into this Link menu).

    "Internet Ranking" lets you play a particular list of songs from the game, but with a 
twist. After each one, you will be given a "password" which corresponds to your score. You 
can go online to Konami's website and enter the password with your name. After doing so, 
the top scorers from each song are posted on the website. This method was typically used 
for Nonstop courses before, but is now used for singular songs in this title. The third 
section, "Edit Data," has sets of special edit data for certain songs in the game. This 
Edit data was created by Konami, for fun and variety for these few songs (this is also a 
feature that was present in their past few DDR games, just accessed differently).

3.3 Diet Mode
--------------------------------------

    This is one of the very cool new modes in the home release of this game. In here, you 
play songs as you normally would in arcade mode. However, while you do this, the game will 
count how many calories you have burned by playing the game. After each stage, your total 
overall calories will be shown, as well as your average calories burnt per song. By 
pressing the "select" button, you can see your calorie results in different conversions. 
Pressing the "circle" button will continue to another song, while pressing "X" button will 
exit the mode. The listings after each stage are as follows:

        -Calories Burnt       (kcal)
        -Calories Average     (kcal)
        -Calories Total       (kcal)

        -Songs Played
        -Conversions
            -Jogging Equivalent   (kilometers)
            -Jumprope Equivalent  (times)
            -Swimming Equivalent  (kilometers)
        -Diet Diary


    There are various options to adjust for this mode, and they can be done in the game's 
option menu. You can restart the calorie counter at any point in there, or adjust how it 
counts in the first place. "Regulation" means that it only counts the proper steps as 
calories, while "Free" means that it counts any steps you press down as burnt calories. In 
the "course difficulty" offerings, the "normal" course uses the steps from the normal game. 
"Diet" course is slightly easier, while "Rakuraku" is beginner mode. While within this 
menu, you are given these settings to adjust before starting:

        -Weight: 1-500 KG

        -Menu: Free/KCal/Min

        -Goal Amount (for menu)
            -Free: Nashi
            -KCal: 10-1000 KCal
            -Mins: 1-120 Minutes

        -Course Difficulty
            *     Rakuraku Course
            **    Diet Course
            ***   Normal Course

5.0 Training Mode
--------------------------------------

    "Training" mode is the place to sharpen your skills on any level that you have 
accessed, without fear of losing. At any time during the menu, you may press the "select" 
button to move the menu to the other side of the screen, or the "X" button to Exit. When 
choosing to "start" the level, pressing "left" or "right" changes between the chosen 
segment or the full song. The menu options are as follows:

    -Music Select

    -Player: Single/Versus/Double/6Panel

    -Level: Basic/Trick/Maniac

    -Assist: Type 1-6/Off

    -Speed: 1-5

    -Controller: 1/2 (6Panel Only)

    -Bar Start: 01-69

    -Bar End: 02-70

    -Start: Segment/Full

    -Sequence Option
        -Little: On/Off
        -Turn: Left/Right/Mirror/Shuffle/Off
        -Hidden: Hidden/Sudden/Stealth/Off

    -Edit

    -Exit


    After each level you play, you get a menu, where you can choose from: 
"Check/Again/Menu." The "Check" option lets you review the song you just played, bar by 
bar, and shows you how well you did for each step (arrow-press) in the level. Each arrow 
will be colored in a specific shade to indicate how each was ranked (yellow=perfect, 
green=great, blue=good, pink=boo, red=miss). Pressing "select" here changes the arrows to 
"timing" colors (yellow=just, blue=early, pink=late, red=miss). "Again" lets you repeat the 
level, and "Menu" takes you back to the main menu. Before this, though, you will be treated 
to the grading screen (as follows):

    -Evaluation
        -Perfect
        -Great
        -Good
        -Boo
        -Miss
        -Max Combo
        -Score

    -Dance Level

    -Timing
        -Just
        -Early
        -Late
        -Miss



5.1 Lesson Mode
--------------------------------------

    "Lesson" mode is a way to learn how to perform some of the more common or tricky steps 
that appear in the game. Rather than simple "training," this mode goes through certain 
types and segments of steps, separately (and not just full songs). To the right of the 
screen will be an assistant graphic which resembles the dance mats. This graphic indicates 
what your feet should do (and where they should go) to pull off these types of steps as the 
song plays. There will also be a "click" played for every step you are supposed to hit, to 
help with timing. This moving guide is an invaluable resource for beginners on the dance 
mats.

    There are Three levels of lessons, each with Eight sections. You will see a crown next 
to each lesson you have already completed on the main menu. On the eighth and final part of 
each lesson, you will perform a lesson on a full song; and this will test the skills which 
you have learned in the previous seven segments. The lessons, with their final song, are as 
follows:

    -Lesson 1: My Summer Love
    -Lesson 2: Higher
    -Lesson 3: Baby Baby Gimme Your Love



5.2 Challenge Mode
--------------------------------------

    This mode is there to add replay value for playing alone. There are different sets of 
challenges, each harder than the last (with Ten challenges per section). The first is 
"Practice," and then comes "Basic," and then "Trick," then "Maniac" and finally "Extra." 
You can not move onto a new section until you've completed all ten trials in the previous 
segment (which is marked by a crown next to each one). The requirements to complete each 
challenge are written in Japanese. They list very specific details, sometimes, which must 
be fulfilled in order to complete the stage. If you screw up completely, you'll be failed 
out of a stage rather than wasting time completing it. The challenges are as follows:

6.0 Records List
--------------------------------------

    This menu keeps a list of your high scores for all of the game's stages (Music High 
Score). You can view high scores for each variant of each song (six variants per song). It 
keeps track of your letter and number high score for each one, as well as your maximum 
combo achieved while earning that score. As a bonus, pressing the "triangle" button while 
on a song in the records table will "Play" the song (like a sound test, it plays in the 
background). In this game, your highest overall scores (Total Ranking) may be viewed during 
the "demo reel" that runs from the main menu (whenever a button is not being pressed).

    At any time during the music menu, you may press the "select" button to "change" from 
"game" mode to "six panel" mode scores. In "Diet" mode, both players' records are shown. 
Pressing the "square" button will clear the records on either side chosen. In "Diet Diary," 
pressing "up" or "down" on the directional pad will stretch the bars to different lengths. 
Pressing the "start" button there will add or remove the measurement bars on the left. The 
menu options are as follows:

    -Music High Score
        -All Game Songs
        -All Game Songs (Six Panel)

    -Diet Records
        -Calories Total       (kcal)
        -Songs Played         (number)
        -Calories Average     (kcal)

        -Jogging Equivalent   (kilometers)
        -Jumprope Equivalent  (times)
        -Swimming Equivalent  (meters)

    -Diet Diary

        -Amount Burned (kcal)

    -Exit



7.0 Edit Mode
--------------------------------------

    This mode is one of the cooler features of the game, as it lets you create your own 
sets of steps for any of the game's levels. From here, you create your steps and then save 
them to a memory card. At any time in the process, if you attempt to start a "new data" or 
"load" data without having "saved" your current data, the game will ask you "Do you wish to 
continue without saving: Yes/No." The menu options are as follows:

        -Player: Single/Double/6Panel
        -Load Official Data: Yes/No

7.1 Arcade Link

    This home version now has a separate mode for creating arcade link files. Originally, 
this was done in the "Options" and "Nonstop Order" menus. But now, you can easily manage 
and update an "arcade link data" file for use with either DDR 4th Mix or DDR 5th Mix. When 
created, the link file will take up one block on the memory card. And, as though it wasn't 
obvious, it's best to go with first-party memory cards from Sony. And for the "DDRT" (Dance 
Dance Revolution Tool) which allows viewing of the data on the fly, you must use the 
Pocketstation.

    The link data file will allow the use of "Edit" data for all supported songs and 
"Nonstop Orders" you have made for the arcade itself. In 5th Mix, you can even store your 
music records and Internet Ranking passwords as though it were a home version. And, on 
either side, you'll have an Information screen to look at. You can create (or update) a 
link file from your console, although it can not be used until it interfaces with the 
arcade (in most functions, anyhow). More info coming later (as this author will go fullout 
on these data modes in the next few weeks, now that 5th Mix is out). As for now, here are 
the menus:

8.0 Nonstop Mode List
--------------------------------------

    "Nonstop" is the alternate difficulty choice when playing "game" mode. In this mode, 
you play from a list of "courses" that are set up by Konami. Each course consists of Four 
stages, which are played straight in a row with no breaks. Playing one course makes up a 
full game in Nonstop. There are Six default Nonstop courses, and then your own Three custom 
orders if you switch them on. The default courses are as follows (with difficulty before 
each stage, abbreviated for "Basic," "Trick," and "Maniac"):

8.1 Nonstop Order
--------------------------------------

    You use this mode to create the custom sets of levels for use in the "Nonstop" mode. By 
pressing the "select" button at any time you are in the main menus, you will bring up the 
"Guide" menu. You can set up and customize up to Three different sets of Four levels. These 
levels can be fully customized as well. And better yet, each of the four stages can have a 
totally different set of difficulty, variant, and effects than the rest. The menu options 
are as follows:

    -Order: [1]/[2]/[3]
        -1st Stage
            -Edit: Title/NoUse
            -Music: Select Music
            -Player 1
                -Level: Basic/Trick/Maniac
                -Little: Little/Off
                -Turn: Left/Right/Mirror/Shuffle/Off
                -Hidden: Hidden/Sudden/Stealth/Off
            -Player 2
                -Same options as with Player 1
        -2nd Stage
            -Same options as with 1st Stage
        -3rd Stage
            -Same options as with 1st Stage
        -4th Stage
            -Same options as with 1st Stage
        -5th Stage
            -Same Options as with 1st Stage

    -Edit Data Check

    -Order Use: NoUse/Use

    -Exit



8.2 Endless Mode
--------------------------------------

    This mode lives up to its name, as it can tend to last forever. You play a constant 
streak of levels, randomly chosen, until your dance meter empties and you lose (you will 
not repeat any songs until you have played each song once, and then it starts another 
random loop). However, you can choose to get a "Break" after every Five levels you play. It 
will ask you "Take a Break?" and give you choices of: "1 Minute/3 Minutes/5 
Minutes/Continue." You have Ten seconds to decide whether you take a Break or you continue 
playing. You can end a Break at any time by pressing the "start" button. During gameplay, 
your "combo" can carry over from one stage to another (so your combo can go up to any 
number, not just up to 999 like usual). Your score and stage can also go on infinitely, 
only limited by how long you can make yourself play. When beginning, press "circle" to 
start the game or "X" to exit. The menu options are as follows:

    -Player: Single/Double/6Panel

    -Level: Basic/Trick/Maniac/Random

    -Turn: Off/Left/Mirror/Right/Shuffle/Random

    -Hidden: Off/Hidden/Sudden/Stealth/Random

    -Little: Off/On/Random

    -Character Select



9.0 Information Screen
--------------------------------------

    This screen keeps track of how far you've progressed in the overall game. The first 
pieces of info on this screen are of general information or about new features that are 
present in this version of DDR. Whenever you earn a secret song or mode, you will get some 
new pieces of information on this screen to let you know (and describe it). Also, you will 
get info segments for the game's normal modes every-other time you start up your game. In 
the upper-right corner of the menu, you can see how many total information pages you have 
earned (you start out with about Four, but will end up with over a dozen; as information 
pages now hold multiple pieces per page). The information is as follows:

    -Welcome to DDR 4th Mix!
    -Solo Mode
    -Challenge Mode
    -Endless
    -Arcade Link
    -Diet Mode, Changes

10.0 Game Secrets and Hidden Options
--------------------------------------

    -Experience. Most of the secrets to be earned in this game are received once you have 
completed a certain number of songs (stages) in the standard arcade modes of play. The game 
internally keeps count of how many songs you have played, and there is no way to view that 
total number itself. For the most part, you will earn a new secret for every Five songs you 
complete. Some secrets will also have alternate methods to earn them (this will be shown 
when multiple requirements are listed under a single secret). If so, you only need to 
fulfill any one of those requirements that is listed, not all of them.

    -Secret Songs. Some of the game's songs will not be accessible from the start of the 
game. For every five songs you complete in any normal game mode, you will earn a new secret 
song. Four secret songs are brand-new Konami originals, while the first twelve are the 
secret songs from the arcade version of 4th Mix. The last two are "Bonus Tracks" which come 
from later titles. Note, these are NOT in the exact proper order yet. I didn't record the 
order when earning them all, so I'll hafta tweak it later. The songs are as follows:

        -Synchronized Love (Red Monster Hyper Mix)
            -clear 05 songs

        -Dancing All Alone
            -clear 15 songs

        -Hero (Happy Grandale Mix)
            -clear 20 songs

        -Dam Dariram (KCP Mix)
            -clear 25 songs

        -If You Were Here (B4 Za Beat Mix)
            -clear 30 songs

        -Let's Talk It Over
            -clear 35 songs

        -Make Your Move
            -clear 40 songs

        -Share My Love
            -clear 45 songs

        -Era [nostalmix]
            -clear 50 songs

        -Holic
            -clear 55 songs

        -.59
            -clear 60 songs

        -Don't Stop! ~AMD 2nd Mix~
            -clear 65 songs

        -Never Let You Down
            -clear 70 songs

        -Groove
            -clear 75 songs

        -Midnite Blaze
            -clear 80 songs

        -Get Me In Your Sight ~AMD Cancun Mix~
            -clear 85 songs

        -Leading Cyber
            -clear 90 songs

        -Orion.78 (Civilization Mix)
            -clear 95 songs


    -Bonus Track. In this title, the two bonus tracks get mixed into the normal song list. 
However, one should know the background on these two songs. "Synchronized Love" is from the 
arcade "DDR 4th Mix Plus," and will be included on the "DDR Extra Mix" for Playstation. 
"Dancing All Alone" is a preview of a song from "DDR 5th Mix." And, in thus, it can only be 
played on "Basic" variant.

    -Challenge Mode. This mode is not accessible from the start of the game. To open it up, 
you must meet the requirement below. Basically, it is earned in place of a second secret 
song, then the songs continue. Once you have done this, it will appear as a choice in the 
main menu, below "Training" mode:

        -clear 10 songs

    -Endless Mode. This mode is not accessible from the start of the game. To open it up, 
you must meet BOTH of the following requirements. Once they are BOTH fulfilled, it will 
appear as a choice on the title screen. In this game, strangely, Endless mode does not have 
any kind of records kept for it. It is just for play value now. The requirements are as 
follows:

        -open up all secret songs, then...
        -complete game mode once

    -Link Version. When you save your data to the memory card, you can then use your memory 
card for the Arcade versions of DDR. This compatible machine, the "Link Version," has a 
slot for the Playstation memory card on it. For one, you can port your "Edit" data to the 
arcade version. Additionally, the custom "NonStop Order" data is compatible with DDR 
Arcade. However, in this game title, the arcade link has its own mode. No secrets involved.



11.0 Contributions and Thank-You's
--------------------------------------

    GameFAQs (www.gamefaqs.com) for hosting this FAQ, along with more great gaming info 
than most any site out there. Keep up the good work, man. Without GameFAQs... where would 
we all go for detailed game help? Sure, lotsa places have great code archives, and some TRY 
to keep all the best FAQs. But who succeeds? Only one, my friend ^_^ Jeff "CJayC" Veasey 
does an astounding, daily job of organizing these entries (and he writes his own wonderful 
FAQs). I must also give a hearty thanks to Al Amaloo, the maintainer of Videogame 
Strategies (vgstrategies.about.com). He has completed perhaps the best and most extensive 
archive of codes and tricks (www.gamewinners.com) and written extensive guides for games 
that would go otherwise un-covered. And what makes these two men (Jeff Veasey and Al 
Amaloo) so special... is that they provide an invaluable service to the gaming community 
out of the goodness of their heart. They work hard, every day, without the help of any 
major affiliate. Bravo to both of you!

    The wonderful patrons of my own message board, the OtherWorlds Shrine (www.tows.org) 
which is sometimes the only refuge for the true gamer. Along with my friend SineSwiper, we 
keep the shrine alive as a place for gamers to respectfully speak and get together while 
online. The friends that I have made there have meant the world to me, despite how my "real 
life" sometimes drags me offline for days at a time. Either way, here's to ya'll... and I 
won't mention any names (as there are too many of you to possibly remember them all now. 
And you'll kill me if I miss any, hehe). The place has been around for years, and I 
guarantee that it will always exist as long as there is an Internet.

    The select few of my OFF-line friends who love gaming almost as much as myself, and 
keep me inspired to keep on playing. Tacchi, you're as obsessed over games as me. We've 
been gaming for well near two decades. We're getting old, dude. And Crystal, well you can 
kick most of our sorry arses ^_^ Steffannee... you introduced me to Will in Rival Schools! 
Scott, you've been a pal through it all, despite how you suck at games ^_^ Kathryn, your 
love and understanding will always be cherished (yes, call me sappy). And Alex, you've been 
there since we were infants, when the NES was only a dream in the semi-near future. Chris, 
you're one of my dearest friends (as well as one of the most eerily unique). Your love for 
the Butterfly song and the goofy dance you do... will always bring a smile to my face.

    And of course, thanks go out to Lynn and Donna! You two are a few of the only people 
who love Pop 'n Music (and Bust a Move of course) as much as I do. Every time we meet is a 
cherished moment. And, speaking of music games, I owe a world of thanks to Malcolm. His 
friendship has meant a ton to me, and he's one of those few folks who plays and works hard 
at ALL the music game series just like I do (Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution, Pop 'n 
Music, Bust a Move, and the countless other Bemani titles as well). And to the fans of 
music games, worldwide, i offer the greatest thanks of all. Our demand is what keeps this 
amazing genre of games coming back to us every month.

    Konami, Sony, Sega, and all the great companies and people who made the game possible. 
Without them, we'd never have been introduced to this wonderous world, beautiful 
characters, and a style of gaming that changed our lives. These Bemani games, like Dance 
Dance Revolution, are perhaps my favorite genre out there right now. It gives those folks 
with a "rhythmical sense" a way to convey that sense through gaming. And besides, it beats 
having another cookie-cutter RPG or fighter to deal with.
