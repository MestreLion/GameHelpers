UPDATES  ________________________________________________________________


American Version Revision History  ______________________________________

Version 0.5 (January 17, 2000)
  Yeah, I'm still alive! 
  Solved why everyone was having so much trouble getting the Dark Rock from 
    the fish in Shevat: you have to talk with the Chu-Chu that's in the lamp 
    (the one which gives you the hints about the rocks) before. Whoops!
  Added how to dislodge and sell the explosive collar in Nortune thanks to 
    Kelvin Valters (kelv10@yahoo.com).
  Added more metronome mini-game information thanks to Daniel Polcari 
    (magus@cyberverse.com).
  Corrected a wrong statement in the Bledavik Tournament walkthrough thanks 
    to Luis Borunda (lborunda@email.exide.com).
  Created "How to contact me" and "Frequently Asked Questions" sections,
    mostly recycling the "Note for Version 0.4".
  Added "Why does it say 'Episode V' at the end" question to one of the
    above sections (guess which one).
  Confirmed how to bargain in the Bledavik Market.
  Also confirmed and corrected Calamity's Exp and G.

Version 0.4 (April 6, 1999)
  You're probably wondering what have I been doing these four months. Check
    the "Note for Version 0.4" (just below this section) for an answer.
  Expanded the walkthrough to cover up to the battle with Achtzehn.
  Finally replaced the songs' names with the official ones, thanks to Oscar
    Nieto Colino. Also, reformatted the list and added the original
    soundtrack's order number for each track (it took a whole evening :P).
  Added "BGM Select" Action Replay code, along with its corresponding list.
  Added "Infinite BP" Action Replay code.
  Completed the Gear Engines, Frames and Armor lists.
  K.M.'s FF7 FAQ "Idiot List" lives on in this FAQ, albeit with only one
    idiot. Look for it after the "Special Thanks" section.
  Added a bit of explanation on how to change Billy's guns ammo to "Equip
    Menu" under "Main Menu" in section 6.
  Incorporated "The Hiding Boy" and "The Three Stones" sections into the
    Walkthrough.
  Removed "The Duneman's Desert" part. Reasons in "Note for Version 0.4".
  Dimetric Simone Houston (dhousto@tiger.lsu.edu) is to be thanked yet again
    for pointing out that I hadn't corrected Elly's Skills' names from the
    Demo, and for sending the proper ones. Much worried for this, I've
    started checking other Skills, etc... and have found more differences:
    I've fixed what I've seen, but I still have to check Gear Skills.
  He (Dimetric Simone) also corrected one more thing: the Cool Glasses
    prevent Confusion, not Blindness as I had listed.
  Added how to get the B&J M686 Gun thanks to Matthias Lambrecht 
    (mlambrecht@handshake.de). This info is at the end of "Reaper's Ship"
    episode in the Walkthrough.
  Added how to bargain at the Bledavik Market thanks to Stephen Xie Minggeng
   (dayspring@stones.com).
  Corrected Calamity's Exp and G awarded amounts thanks to Jayce A. 
    (seikenshi@postmark.net)
  Added a Hob Meat and two Hob Jerky's in the Bledavik Castle's kitchen, 
    thanks to Bryan H (fallingasleep@hotmail.com).
  Added information about a minigame in the Kaiser's room in Nortune, thanks
    to d. Page (d@prometheus.frii.com) and Ion Ioner (ionero0@yahoo.com).
  Added how to talk to the Nortune doctor in A Block.
  Added the use of the Spider Web for those that were wondering.

Version 0.3 (December 1, 1998)
  Revised the Walkthrough a bit as a result of having to restart: most
    noticeably, I changed the course to follow to deactivate the sand
    sensors in Stalagtite Cave, and revised the Tournament part as well.
  Included the locations of the notorious three stones at Shevat. Information
    on them was provided by: Pauzanes Neto (shinji08@geocities.com), Daryl
    (daryl@dnet.net.id) and Jason F. Long (tobin@eldrick.simplenet.com).
  Added how to get the Hide and Seek Badge in Aveh, thanks to Beth
    (BIZAROELNE@aol.com).
  Added the conversion to metric units of XenoGears' measurement units,
    again thanks to Pauzanes Neto (shinji08@geocities.com).
  Added that if you don't beat Dan at the tournament, he gives you the
    Wedding Dress. Thanks to Shalloween (Shalloween@aol.com), Andy Schiestl
    (ajs2916@unix.tamu.edu), Yao (amici@the.net.ph) and Patrick Miller
    (pmiller@cis.ysu.edu) for this.
  And more about the tournament: if you make the fights last longer, Bart
    will encounter less guards in the castle. 
  Added a way to get an M Disk early in the game thanks to Stuart Logan
    (Sturat@webtv.net).
  Added how to get 120 G In Citan's house thanks to Jim Argyros
    (jargyros@iastate.edu).
  Corrected all Gear Skills : I had put them with the Japanese buttons.
    Thanks to Dimetric Simone Houston (dhousto@tiger.lsu.edu) for making me
    note this.
  Also, for some reason I forgot to correct Citan's with Katana's Skills
    when I got the US complete version. Their proper names have been kindly
    sent in by Hieu Le (mad_ogre@hotmail.com), however, and have been
    corrected.

Version 0.2 (November 5, 1998)
  Since I (shock!) actually have the game now, I was able to check and
    correct quite some things, especially the walkthrough, which has also
    been expanded and now covers up to Nisan. This has taken a lot of time
    and left my eyes bleeding, but it's been worth it. Now let me die in
    peace.
  Ah, so they went ahead and changed the item names from the demo version,
    huh? OK, I revised all lists and set everything straight (phew!).
  Added "Selling Prices" to "Charts".
  Added "Status Effects" to "Charts".
  Added all Gear Skills to "Charts".
  Added "Bledavik Waterway Map" to, of all sections, "Maps".
  Added "Action Replay / Game Shark Codes" section
  Added the location of Fei's savings. Stuart Logan (Sturat@webtv.net) and
    Mike Bridge (z964453@wheat.farm.niu.edu) are to be thanked for this.
  Added the location of the Mermaid Tear, again thanks to Stuart Logan.
  Added the location of a Spider thanks to Strahinja "Strasa" Acimovic
    (victor_tzimisce@ hotmail.com) and yet again Stuart Logan.
  Corrected a mistake thanks to Brian Youn (bwa@us.ibm.com): Attack Levels
    1, 2 and 3 do not multiply the amount of fuel recovered with a Charger
    (as Level Infinite does), but rather, add 20, 40 and 60 to that amount.
  Made lots and lots of small corrections, mostly on names from the
    Japanese version. Everything should be correct now, but I know it won't.

Version 0.1 (October 15, 1998)
  First version of the US FAQ, released before even the game itself. Already
    contains almost complete (?) item, Abilities and Skill lists, except for
    Gear Skills and some other things.
  Also contains the beginning of the walkthrough from the Japanese FAQ,
    translated and somewhat modified (added some items that can be obtained
    at Lahan). I've almost completelly rewritten the "Battle" section under
    "Playing the Game", which was fragmented and incomplete (no Skill
    explanation! Ulp!).
  All in all, this is much like version 0.7 of the Japanese FAQ, adapted
    for the US release, and with a couple of additions.

INTRODUCTION  ___________________________________________________________

As mentioned above, this FAQ is based on the American version of Xenogears.
It seems that Square has finally redeemed themselves in their (IMO) only
fault (that is, translation quality). I'm happy to see that the quality in
Xenogears' translation is amazing, almost back to the times of Ted Woolsey
or so. This couldn't be more in time, also, since in my opinion Xenogears is
the real masterpiece in Square's history, kicking some serious backside of
pretty much everything else that isn't from Square, as usual, and being
quite superior in most aspects (except maybe graphically) to anything else
Square has to offer.

ALL information in this FAQ applies to the American version of the game 
only, ESPECIALLY the Action Replay / Game Shark codes. They will NOT work 
in the Japanese version of XenoGears. If you happen to have that version,
you should check GameFaqs for the Japanese version of this FAQ. Note,
however, that it's quite outdated, that its walkthrough is incomplete and
discontinued, and that I probably won't be updating it at least until I
finish the US game, if at all. However, you can use the walkthrough in this
(the US) version to help you.

Well, remember that I'm Spanish, which means English is my second language.
So expect errors. I seem to be especially good in making up non-existant
"Spanglish" words ^_^; so please bear with me.



==========================================================================
   2   .   D I S C   O N E   W A L K T H R O U G H
==========================================================================

Until this walkthrough is finished, remember that you can find David
Johnson's complete walkthrough at:

                 <www.gamefaqs.com>


About the monsters: The information is arranged like this:

   Name of monster
     How many HP it has, then, experience and money it awards when beaten,
     and if applicable, items obtained by beating it.
     "Character-sized" or "Gear-sized", then a physical description.
     If applicable, techniques it uses, sometimes with an explanation.

Most of the info is self-explanatory. The bit about "character-sized" or
"Gear-sized" means whether if it is a character-sized, hand-drawn enemy or a
Gear-sized, polygonal one. You'll understand as you play...

BTW, the HP ratings have been obtained by editing the PSX's memory so they
are 100% accurate. This is also how I obtained the HP of indestructible or
even untargettable enemies (or allies).

The monster info's format is provisional, since I plan on separating the 
monster list from the walkthrough once I finish it. I know it's a bit 
bothersome having them intertwined like this, but it's a lot easier for me 
to handle. Be patient.

Another thing to note is that some enemies award different amounts of
Experience and G when encountered at different times of the game. This is
especially noticeable in battles that are fought at certain points of the
story. For example, the first time you encounter a Trooper, its description 
is:

   Trooper
     HP 180, Exp 180, G 250.
     Gear-sized. One-eyed desert Gear.

But from there on, when you find a Trooper in a random encounter, its stats
will be as follows:

   Trooper
     HP 180, Exp 250, G 100. Leaves Extra Ar.
     Gear-sized. One-eyed desert Gear.

even though it's exactly the same enemy. Since it would be a mess to list
all variants, I'm only listing the stats for the first time you meet a given
kind of enemy.

As a final note, I will try not to describe anything happening in
conversations and sequences, to minimize the risk of spoiling things for
people. I won't tell you to talk to any people but the neccesary ones
either, but this doesn't mean you shouldn't. In fact, one of the many high
points of Xenogears is that about everyone has something to say that is
worth listening to. So improve your social skills! ^_^;

                   L a h a n   V i l l a g e

   Items in this area: Aquasol x5, Aquasol S, Spider Web, Eyeball, 
   Power Ring, RPS Badge, 200 G, 120 G, 80 G.

   After the FMV showing the crash of a huge ship into your planet long
   ago, and the non-interactive sequence showing a glimpse of the present,
   you'll find yourself reconstructing the sequence of events that led
   there. In other words, you begin playing a flashback.

   Your main character is Fei. 

   Fei's initial equipment: Martial Wear, Martial Cap, Stamina Ring.
   Fei's initial items: None.
   Fei's initial money: 100 G.

   The control switches to you after Fei finishes his picture. You can
   check the nice pictures he's done in this very room. Check Fei's bed
   and he'll pick up his savings, 200 G. Thanks to Stuart Logan (Sturat@
   webtv.net) and Mike Bridge (z964453@wheat.farm.niu.edu) for this. You can
   also sleep here whenever you want to recover all your HP / EP to full).

   In the northern room of this very floor you can talk to a maid who
   will tell you of your arrival to Lahan town. In the westernmost room
   there are two barrels containing one Aquasol each. Also in this room,
   you can jump up to grab the Spider Web on the wall. It might save you
   50 G quite a bit later on.

   Up the stairs then. Here you can talk to Timothy (Alice's fiancee and
   Fei's friend) and Lee (the village chief and sort of Fei's foster father)
   among others. When you try to leave, Dan (Alice's brother) will come in
   and ask you to talk to him outside.


   Talk to Dan outside if you want. I don't think the choice you have to
   make here affects the game in any way.

   You can also listen to the woman by the cow and tell her that what she
   says makes sense (well it does). You'll receive another AquaSol.
   Generally speaking, I've found that every single of Xenogears's
   inhabitants have something either insightful or funny to say (sometimes
   both... whatever they are paying the translator, it's too little).

   If you want more Aquasol, talk twice to the old man next to the cow
   behind the elder's house. Then talk to him again for yet another
   Aquasol.

   Throw yourself into the well a few times. Really! You'll get an Eyeball
   the first time, an Aquasol S the second and a Power Ring the third.


   There are quite some buildings in the town outside. For one, there's
   a shop which sells:

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Rosesol                 100
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   BTW, never EVER buy Survival Tents. Get Omegasol instead. The reason for
   this is that they have the same cost/effect ratio (since the Tents heal
   all three characters, but cost thrice as much), but Tents MUST be used
   on all characters AND they can only be used in Memory Cubes or in the
   World Map!


   There is also a bar, in which you can talk to the customers (often 
   resulting in quite funny dialogue ^_^). Talk to the drunk man and
   tell him that drink won't make his situation any better, and he'll
   give you the Mermaid Tear, which will be useful later. Thanks again
   to Stuart Logan (Sturat@webtv.net) for this.
   Upstairs, you can find a mother and his daughter, and talk to them.


   Another house has a guy playing rock, paper, scissors. If you decide to
   challenge him, you'll have to select the option quite quickly (as you 
   would in a real RPS game). Each time you win, he'll give you 50 G, and
   each time you lose, he'll take 50 G from you (fair enough ^_^). However,
   should you manage to beat him five times in a row, he'll give you the
   "Mythical RPS Hero Badge" (AKA RPS Badge), which will be useful later.
   Unfortunatelly, all efforts of trying to rationalize this guy's strategy
   when picking choices have proven useless to all people who have tried
   (including myself). Though we thought there was method in his madness, it
   seems that his choices are completelly random, so good luck.

   Of course, if you happen to own an Action Replay or Game Shark, you can
   still just use my "have won 4 RPS games in a row" code, and just win a
   fifth. I'm not sure if you can find and challenge him later in the game,
   or obtain the RPS Badge otherwise, so don't overlook this event.

   In this very house, you can talk to the woman downstairs and choose
   the first option to receive 120 G.


   There's the village consultant's house too (it's the typical "tutorial"
   place). It would be a good idea to check the explanations on Skills and
   so on. Since the translation quality is so high, the explanations are
   quite clear, and even interesting.

   Lucca from Chrono Trigger will explain the save procedure (and she IS
   Lucca ^_^! Answer "no" when she asks you about hearing her explanation!).
   You can also ask the village's consultant about general battle commands,
   and the guy in front of him about Abilities and Skills. This guy will
   give you 80 G if you ask him about Death Blow Skills. Lastly, the woman
   will tell you about spinning the view using L1 and R1.
   

   You might want to wander outside the town (but not by its northern
   side, which leads to the mountain) to check the world map. Since you'll
   have to go out of the town later anyway, enemies you can find there are
   explained later.


   You can also go to the mountain North of Lahan if you want, but you'll
   be going there in a moment anyway, so...


   When you're done, go to the house which has a woman at its door and
   talk to her. Go through the door and up the stairs to meet Alice.

   Once the scene's over, go to the mountain north of the village. This
   is the first "dungeon" of sorts.

   Items in this area: Aquasol x2, Bird Egg, Spider.

   Enemies in this area:
   Hobgob <brown>
     HP 15 (of a maximum of 30), Exp 2, G 0. Leaves Hob-Jerky. Leaves
     Hob-Steak if defeated with a fire-elemental attack.
     Character-sized. Potato-like thing ^_^;
     Uses "Gobble-gobble/HP Absorb". Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one
     fifth of a character's maximum HP.
   Jackal
     HP 14, Exp 3, G 0.
     Character-sized. Blue wolf-like creature.
     Uses "Jackal Tackle". Physical attack.

   Now that we're talking about that, the bit about roasting the Hobgobs to
   get Hob-Steaks is extremelly useful, specially when you get Elly later
   on (which has fire-elemental Ethers). Hob-Steaks recover 150 HP (but
   can't be used in battle) and can be sold for 150 G.

   If you check the rock just Northwest of the Memory Cube, you'll notice a
   lighter, sand-colored streak. You can walk up that streak without
   falling, and once you reach the tree, jump up to grab a Bird's Egg
   (choose the first option). However its owner won't be too pleased about
   it, and it will follow you to the end of this section demanding you to
   return the egg. Each time you answer no (bottom option), it'll peck you
   for 1 damage. It'll go away if you enter Lahan but it'll be back on top
   of your head if you go back into the mountain.

   In the first crossroad where the Memory Cube is, take the West path for
   the shortest route, or the East for a longer one (including a jump)
   during which you can get an Aquasol. Anyway, you'll end up in a platform
   with a boy on it. He'll tell you to make a running jump across the ledge.
   Do so, then cross the bridge. After that you can jump down to get (you
   guessed it) another Aquasol. Then climb back up, but before you exit
   North, check the tree that's near a rock to the West of the sign. Jump up
   to reach its branches and a spider will appear. Don't be afraid of it,
   and just jump again and press Cross to grab it. It will be useful later.
   Thanks to Strahinja "Strasa" Acimovic (victor_tzimisce@hotmail.com) and
   Stuart Logan (Sturat@webtv.net) for this tip.

   Items in this area: Aquasol, Midori's Ring, 120 G.

   Head to the back door of the house. There will be some flowers there,
   leaving a small space between them and the wall of the building. Well, 
   jump over to that space, then search the flowers from that side to 
   receive Midori's Ring (it doesn't show up in the item list).
   You can also check the top of a rock near that: there is bird food
   over it (it doesn't serve any purpose, though). You can even check
   them again and the message will be different (this happens a lot in
   this game).
   After that, check the door in the middle floor of the observatory. A 
   chicken will pop up ^_^ but if you search where it came from, there's 
   an Aquasol. 
   Elsewhere, you can explore the place at your leisure. The top floor's
   room has a ladder that leads to a telescope, with which you can check
   a bit of the world map. If you jump down to the small roof of the room
   you climbed up to the telescope from, and check the chimney, you'll get
   120 G (whoa, stealing from Citan... how low can you get? ^_^;). Thanks a
   lot to Jim Argyros (jargyros@iastate.edu) for this tip.

   Inside the room at ground level of the building, you'll meet Citan's
   wife, Yui, and daughter, Midori. Talk to Yui, and, if you have it,
   Fei'll give her the Bird Egg. Note that Fei won't give Midori her ring,
   though! ^_^;

   Now head to the building with the Land Crab over it (that insect /
   helicopter machine). Enter it after the sequence, and touch the music
   box in there. This will trigger some sequences.

   After the sequence, it will be at night. If you brought the Bird Egg to
   Yui, she'll comment on how it improved the meal, and there'll be a
   comment about how Fei has gained some weight (this is actually true,
   since he begins at 167.2 and weights 189.2 after the meal if you brought
   the egg ^_^;). BTW, for those of you that are wondering, you can't get
   the egg from the nest past this point, which means that you can't keep
   the egg either way.

   at the Memory Cube if you want.

   After another sequence, a Gear battle will ensue. Refer to the

   Battle: 
   Musha Mk100 x2
     HP 150, Exp 90, G 50.
     Gear-sized. Somewhat old-looking war Gear.

   Really easy. You'd have problems trying to lose against them.

   Some dramatic events will follow now. Once the sequences are over,
   you'll find yourself in the world map again.

   Enemies in grassland areas:
   Hobgob <brown>
   Hopper
     HP 100, Exp 8, G 0. Leaves Fencing Wear.
     Character-sized. Two-legged green creature.
   Lil' Kobold
     HP 35, Exp 3, G 0. Leaves Fencing Hat.
     Character-sized. Kobold (goblin-alike) with a bow.

   You can't enter Lahan (rather, there's not much Lahan left to enter to),
   but you can go to the mountain instead. Don't, though.
   Head for the forest West of where you are, and find an entrance on its
   north-easthern border.

   Items in this area: Aquasol

   Enemies in this area:
   Hobgob <brown>
   Jackal
   Armor Grub
     HP 7, Exp 35, G 0. Leaves Bizfruit.
     Character-sized. Armored insect-like creature. All physical attacks
     inflict 1 damage (including Skills), so use either Triangle attacks or
     the "Guided Shot".

   During this dungeon, you will find Hobgobs around. You can "talk" to
   them to fight them, but beware that you won't be able to run from these
   battles. 

   Proceed SW until the crossroad. Take the leftmost (easthernmost) path.
   Jump to the small rock, then to the big, stepped one. Jump up the steps 
   to the fallen tree-trunk. Walk over it until you come across another
   tree-trunk over which this is leaning. Jump down to its left (SW) side
   and grab the (sigh) Aquasol. Go all the way to the SW and climb the rock
   with the tree roots on it to reach the Memory Cube. Continue through the
   winding ledge to reach another tree-trunk. Fight the Hobgob group
   standing before the rock. You have three options now: A) Get rolled over
   by the boulder (-5 HP), B) Run Indiana Jones-like all the way through the
   tree only to realize there's no more tree and you have to jump down to
   almost the start, or C) jump to the ledge you came from as soon as you
   see it moving. You guessed it: C) is the right answer. It's easier said
   than done, so pay attention when the fight against the Hobgobs ends.
   After that, jump back and continue through where the boulder was.

   There'll be an anime scene introducing (yes!! yes!!) Elly now, after
   which you'll fight two enemies.

   Battle: 
   Forest Elf <type 1> x2
     HP 41, Exp 21, G 0. Leaves Zetasol.
     Character-sized. Blue humanoid.

   It'll take less than two rounds (in fact, you'll be fighting Forest Elfs
   as regular enemies from now on). After this, there'll be another scene,
   then you'll be in the next part of the forest.

                 s e c o n d   s e c t i o n

   Items in this area: Aquasol, Survival Tent, Arcane Rod

   Enemies in this area:
   Dive Bomber
     HP 30, Exp 19, G 0.
     Character-sized. Green, raven-like bird.
     Uses "Watches in wait". This basically makes them lose a turn, but they
     can't be hit using physical attacks when they're on a tree.
     Uses "Flutter". Flaps wings for a three hit combo.
   Forest Elf <type 1>
     HP 41, Exp 21, G 0. Leaves Zetasol.
     Character-sized. Blue humanoid.

   Elly has joined you at this point.

   Elly's initial equipment: Magical Rod, Pilot Uniform, Ether Stone, 
   Anti Eth Stone.

   Go South to the crossroad. To the right (West) is an Aquasol. Go back and
   take the left (East) path, then continue South to another crossroad. The
   left (North) path leads to a fallen tree which tilts under your weight
   allowing you to go back to the first section, but it's not too useful, is
   it? Take the right (South) path then. Just before the jump, you can turn
   to the West and jump down to a platform containing a chest with an Arcane
   Rod for Elly. From here, you have no choice but to jump down and continue
   NE up to the first crossroad of the section. Like before, go East, then
   South, but this time jump across the gap. You'll find a Memory Cube and a
   chest containing a Survival Tent. After that, continue through the stone
   bridge to trigger a fight.
   
   Battle: 
   Forest Elf <type 1> x2, Dive Bomber x2

   Just the same as a regular battle, but it is always triggered when 
   crossing the bridge (or jumping over the gap). Also, you can't run 
   from this one.

   Right after the fight, there will be another scene with some anime, then
   Elly will leave the party and she will be attacked by the Rankar (Star
   Wars, anyone?). However, if you didn't get the Arcane Rod before, you can
   (quite unpolitely) hop to the ledge North of the one you're standing on
   to get it (uh, it's for her, so I guess she won't get angry with you
   ^_^;). However, this way you won't get to use it until much later (since
   Elly's no longer in your party). You can get the Rod even later if you
   want to be a gentleman, though. You can also save in the Memory Cube if
   you want. Go SW after that to face the Rankar.

   Boss: 
   Rankar Dragon
     HP 99999, Exp 348, G 0. Leaves Scales.
     Gear-sized. Tyrannosaur-like.

   There's no way you can win this battle on foot (not without an Action
   Replay, anyway), so just select "defend" for a while until Citan arrives
   in the Land Crab with the Weltall.

   Boss: 
   Rankar Dragon
     HP 480, Exp 348, G 0. Leaves Scales.
     Gear-sized. Tyrannosaur-like. 
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Slow".

   When inside the Weltall, alternate between Cross attacks to charge your
   Attack Level (you have plenty of fuel and the Rankar's evade rate is
   quite low), and Triangle, Triangle Skills to use it. Remember than the
   single attacks will charge your Attack Level even if they miss. Cross
   attacks inflict around 70 damage and T,T Skills around 140. The Rankar
   will use an attack which causes "Slow" but there's not much you can do
   about it. Anyway, he should be out in about eight rounds.

   After then, there'll be a scene. Elly will leave, and Citan will join.
   Finally, you'll leave the Blackmoon Forest.

   Citan's initial equipment: Fencing Wear, Glasses, Step Shoes.

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Hobgob <brown>
   Lil' Kobold

   Enemies in desert areas:
   Sand Shark
     HP 111, Exp 121, G 0. 
     Character-sized. Fish-like green creature.
   Sand Man
     HP 50, Exp 60, G 75. 
     Character-sized. Looks like a Tusken Raider in a raincoat ^_^;

   You can enter the desert town of Dazil (by its North or its West gate),
   or wander off into the deep desert, which will reveal a field screen with
   enemies (Sand Sharks and Sand Men) that loops indefinitelly. So go to
   Dazil.


                          D a z i l

   I'm assuming you're entering the town by its North gate; if that's not
   the case, the order of the buildings will be reversed.

   In a stall (improvised with wheels ^_^;) you can buy the following:

   Character Equipment:
   Magical Rod              50
   Arcane Rod              100
   Leather Whip             60
   Martial Wear             50
   Fencing Wear             80
   Martial Cap              30
   Fencing Cap              40
   Power Ring              200
   Stamina Ring            150

   Just opposite of that, there's a building which you must enter. Talk to
   the man behind the counter and he'll talk you about his sandbuggy (you
   need to do this). Further into the town, there's another stall in the
   street surrounded by people, which sells:
   
   Character Items:
   AquaSol                  20
   RoseSol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   Survival Tent           150

   Get as many Aquasol as you think you'll need. Rosesol aren't that useful 
   since Abilities play a quite secondary role in XenoGears. Also, it's a
   good idea to get some Physisol and Mentsol: they recover status effects.

   One of the many buildings in the town contains a Memory Cube. In another
   one (the inn, cost 10 G), you will meet Big Joe. 

   Finally, enter the large building with the cross-like signs (which you'll
   get to see quite a bit). You'll be told why you can't get the parts you
   need.

   Once you've done this, go back to the sandbuggy's owner's house. The
   buggy will be outside it and there'll be a scene. Now enter the house and
   talk to the owner again. He'll lend it to Citan, who will leave your
   party. Now leave Dazil and enter the Western part of the desert.


                           D e s e r t

   Enemies in this area: 
   Sand Shark
   Sand Man
   Aveh Soldier
     HP 60, Exp 75, G 35. Leaves Aquasol, Rosesol.
     Character-sized. Soldier with brown helmet and aviation glasses on.

   You'll spot two Aveh Gears as you enter. Continue straight until you
   reach the end of the screen. Another scene will follow. Then, you'll have
   to cross two more screens.
   After than, Fei will borrow a bike from an Aveh soldier and use it to
   cross the desert (boo! I was expecting a mini-game here...) until he's
   surrounded by Aveh Gears. Citan will come to the rescue in the Weltall,
   at which point he'll as usual leave the honors to you.

   Battle: 
   Trooper x2
     HP 180, Exp 180, G 250.
     Gear-sized. One-eyed desert Gear.

   Easy. Take one down with two Cross attacks, then the other with any Skill
   you like.
   At this point, Grahf will appear and after some talk, he'll summon a
   giant worm-like creature.

   Boss: 
   Wyrm
     HP 200, Exp 1044, G 0. Leaves Eyeball.
     Gear-sized. Worm-like three-jawed monster.
     Uses "Slurp/absorb fuel". Drains 60 fuel.
     Uses "Counter Slurp/absorb fuel". Wyrm will drain 60 fuel every time
     you use a physical attack against it.

   You can only hurt Wyrm with "Guided Shot" or with the second hit of a 
   string. The former inflicts around 60 damage, so it's your best option.
   The T,S ("Reppu") Skill causes 80 damage and you'll most likely have
   learnt it by now, so it's not bad either but keep in mind that you will
   lose one out of each two rounds charging your Attack Level. BTW, use
   Triangle attacks to do so: all three kinds of regular attacks will
   inflict 0 damage and Triangle cost less fuel (which is critical in this
   battle). If you don't have that Skill, T,T ("Raigeki") inflicts around 40
   damage (so don't use it unless you've depleted your EP somehow).

   After that, you'll be surrounded by Gears again, and this time you'll
   have to surrender. You'll find yourself in a Transport afterwards.
   Save your game in the Memory Cube. Talk to Citan twice and the second
   time choose the second option to keep talking or the first one to go to
   sleep.

   Items in this area: Survival Tent, Rosesol

   Once the scenes are over, you'll find yourself in the same cell you were
   in. The door is open, but the SandCrawler is sinking into the desert and
   sand is starting to fill the floor! The sand level rises continuously, so
   you better be fast. If it ever covers above your head, you'll have to
   restart from the cell again (though you'll keep the items you got before
   "drowning"). I'm not sure if doing so affects the game or not, but I
   don't think so.

   Once you exit the cell from the North, you can head to the East or to the
   West. Since I assume you want to get all items, here's what you have to
   do: Go to the East, then South into a small room and open the chest
   containing a Survival Tent. If you continue to the East, you'll reach a
   ladder leading directly to the upper floor (unless you are too late and
   sand is already spilling from it), but you don't want to, because that
   way you'd miss the items in the lower floor. So go back to the West and
   enter the first door to the South after the cell's. Get the RoseSol and
   exit the room. Now keep going West until you come across a ladder going
   down to the lower floor. If you want, you can push the switch on the door
   to shut it and prevent the sand from entering the room (it won't matter
   once you go down the ladder, though).

   Enemies in this area:   
   Aveh Soldier
   Aveh Corporal
     HP 60, Exp 75, G 40. Leaves Leather Hat.
     Character-sized. Bigger soldier with white helmet and aviation glasses
     on his head.

   When fighting in the Transport, "Fire from the Engine Room!" will happen
   every two turns or so. This causes around 30-40 damage to all, including
   enemies.

   Head East, then climb the ladder to the North (as time goes on, a hole 
   will open in the floor below it, but you can still reach the ladder by 
   jumping from its side). Go all the way to the North, then West to get an
   Extra Ar +1 (Gear equipment). Go all the way back to the East and South,
   then go up the staircase leading South. Cross the walkway and get the
   chest containing a Leather Vest. Note that if you take too long, some of
   the planks in the walkway will fall and you'll have to jump over them. It
   is still possible to get the Leather Vest: jump as far as you can and
   press Cross as you touch the chest in mid-air (you'll fall through the
   hole, so go back South, up the stair, West and North). Anyway, follow the
   walkway to the East and up the ladder to the upper floor.

   Phew! There are no hurries now. Save in the Memory Cube. Go North, West,
   then South. As far as I know, there is no way to climb the crates.

   Go South through the crane. Don't worry about falling off, Fei will 
   pull himself up again. If you take too long to cross the crane, you'll 
   have to start from the cell again. If that happens, remember you keep 
   all the items you got before that, so go East when you exit the cell to 
   go directly to the upper floor. But remember to reach the ladder before 
   sand begins to spill from it.
   The crane is composed by two bars, between which you have to switch 
   because they're blocked at different points. Start on the Eastern one, 
   then switch each time you can while going South. I've found that it's
   actually easier to switch bars by jumping than by walking over the
   transversal bars, BTW.
   When you get to the other side of the crane, Fei'll get into the Weltall,
   and Bart will attack him in the Brigander.

   Boss: 
   Brigandier
     HP 800, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Red Gear with whips attached.
     Uses "Wild Smile". Causes "Camera Damaged".
     Uses "Chain Whip". Physical attack.

   As usual, turn on the booster the first round. He will use Wild Smile, 
   which lowers your Accuracy and Evade. Therefore, don't use any Cross
   attacks while you're blind, as he'll evade them most of the times.
   However, this status will wear off, so pay attention to the "Camera
   Damaged" sign below your usual bunch of Gear info in your turn, and use
   Cross attacks again once it dissapears.
   Guided Shot causes around 150 damage. You're probably better off with T,S
   strings, though; they will hit most of the times and cause around 250
   damage (each 2 rounds, remember). Anyway, not very hard.

   After the fight, you'll both sink into a cave below the sand.

   Items in this area: Gold Nugget, Iron GWhip

   Enemies in this area:   
   Sand Man
   Tin Robo
     HP 138, Exp 680, G 210. Leaves Extra Ar, Extra Ar +1.
     Gear-sized. Blocky, construction type-looking Gear with a crane arm.
   Nomad Fix Bot
     HP 110, Exp 420, G 200.
     Gear-sized. Grayish-green repairs Gear with pincers.
     Uses "Fill up/restore fuel". Restores about 250 of YOUR Fuel.
     Uses "Repair/restore Gear HP". Restores about 90 of YOUR HP.
   Medusoid <type 1>
     HP 65, Exp 698, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Jellyfish-looking creature.
     Uses "Charging". Loses a turn, but uses "Flash" the next one.
     Uses "Flash". Causes "Camera Damaged".
   May Fly
     HP 555, Exp 1410, G 690. Leaves Extra Ar +1, Eyeball.
     Gear-sized. Strange cross between a huge fly and a Gear. Takes little
     or no damage from any attacks except second hits of Gear Skills.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Armor Damage".

   Bart has joined you at this point. Besides, you get to control your Gears
   for the first time.

   Bart's initial equipment: Leather Whip, Red Mail, Power Ring, Stamina
   Ring.
   Weltall's initial equipment: Extra Ar, Extra Ar, Old Circuit.
   Engine : G4-1200. Frame: WELT-01800. Armor: MS 3.
   Brigandier's initial equipment: Leather GWhip, Extra Ar +1, A/C, Lens
   Cover.
   Engine : G4-1200. Frame: BRIG-01900. Armor: MS 3.

   In this cave, whenever you fight a Nomad Fix Bot, don't destroy it just
   yet and it'll very nicely restore your HP and Fuel. It'll randomly attack
   you as well, but the damage it inflicts is minimal.

   Replace one of Weltall's Extra Ar for the Extra Ar +1 you got in the
   Transport. Also, as soon as a beaten Tin Robo leaves another Extra Ar +1,
   replace the remaining Extra Ar with it.
   Save, then head straight to the South and follow the wall to the West.
   Press Cross at the rock blocking your way to push it. After the scene,
   head straight South again to get the Gold Nugget (it will be useful MUCH
   later on, almost at the end of the game. Thanks to Tatsushi Nakao for the
   info). After that, go West and cross the entrance.

   Go SW until the end of the long passageway (as if you had any other
   option). In the new section, cross the bridge until the green Gear. Head
   West, then North, and jump up the platforms (the one with nothing on it,
   the one with the black and red machine, then the one with a chest) to get
   an Iron GWhip for the Brigandier. Jump down and go back South and East,
   then SW after the green Gear to get to a new section.

   Jump up the platforms. Go SW and save at the Memory Cube. Then get off
   your Gears and enter the small cave entrance.

   After the dialogue, talk to Balthazar (Bal) for more of it. Then, you can
   talk to him again and choose the third option to buy things from him.

   Gear Engine:
   G6-1200                1200

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-02100              400
   WELT-02500              800
   HEIM-03200             1800
   BRIG-02200              500
   BRIG-02700              900

   Gear Armor:
   MS Steel Plate #6       500

   Gear Weapons:
   None

   Gear Parts:
   Extra Ar +1              50

   Character Items:
   AquaSol                  20
   RoseSol                 100
   OmegaSol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   You should upgrade both Gears' Engine, Frame and Armor; though it's going
   to cost almost all the money you have, it will be worth it. Especially,
   as Bal says, the Engine: it'll double the damage you inflict, not to
   mention it allows you to carry more fuel. Beating this dungeon's boss
   will be VERY hard without them. If you need money, sell Brigandier's
   Leather GWhip (since you have an Iron GWhip).
   As in every other place in which you can buy Gear stuff, you can also
   replenish your Gears' HP and Fuel (for a price) here. Generally speaking,
   you should always do so, but not before you've upgraded your frames and
   engines, since they can hold more HP and fuel. In this case the engine
   holds the same amount of fuel, though. Replace all the Extra Ar parts you
   have equipped by Extra Ar +1. Also, if you haven't done so already, this
   would be a good time to stock up in Omegasol.

   After you're done, exit Bal's place and get into your Gears again. You 
   have to find two sensors now. Actually, you have already come across one 
   of them; it was the machine near the chest which had an Iron GWhip.
   However, you should deactivate the other one first.

   In the following section, you'll be in a stone bridge over the place 
   with the green Gear and the first sensor, so be sure not to fall off
   (actually, I think you can't ^_^;). After this, you'll be in a long
   passageway to the North, so you know what you have to do.

   After that, go to the North and you'll find a bridge to the West. Now you
   want to be careful. Remember the section that's below you right now?
   That's right, it's the very beginning of the entire dungeon! Go through
   the bridge and deactivate the sensor by pressing Cross in front of it.

   Then drop down to the South. Yes, you heard me right: drop down to the
   first section of the dungeon. Keep going South, and go through the
   passage. Once you're back to the section with the bridge and the green
   Gear (BTW, you can talk to him and he'll tell you the locations of the
   sensors again), head for the second sensor. In case you've forgotten,
   that's through the bridge, Northwest after that, then up the platforms.
   Presss Cross at the sensor to deactivate it. Then head back to Bal's
   house. Talk to Bal and the gate will open. After the scene, you'll be
   outside Bal's house; you can still go back and buy from him, though. In
   fact, you should if you haven't completelly upgraded your Gears yet, as
   you'll have more money than last time.

   Go South through the huge gate. In the new section, go South, then get
   out of your Gears and enter the Gondola to the East. Turn the red switch
   on (select the first option when prompted) and go back to your Gears. Now
   go to the elevator to the West and activate it. Head to the South, down
   the steps then up again, save at the Memory Cube, then take the elevator
   down.
 
   In the next room you'll see Calamity flying around. You can walk through
   the cave a bit before it attacks you, but there's not much you can do.

   Boss: 
   Calamity
     HP 2500, Exp 8642, G 2000.
     Gear-sized. Huge, bulky Gear with twin engines on its back.

   Thanks to Jayce A. (seikenshi@postmark.net) for the info about the
   Experience and G awarded by Calamity's defeat. I had previously listed
   them as 0, but Jayce checked his characters' stats before and after the
   battle and noticed these changes. BTW, I messed up last time and put
   4321 as the Exp awarded when it's 8642, my mistake.

   Put on Booster as soon as you start. Finger Bullet does 0 damage, so
   don't bother. Use Skills instead: Fei's T,S and Bart's T,T (unless you
   made Bart fight outside the Brigandier, in which case he could have
   learnt T,S, but it's not worth the trouble). His evade rate is almost
   nil (he does block sometimes, though), so you can abuse Cross attacks:
   they only do around 70 damage, however. Bart's T,T does around 180, and
   Fei's T,S around 200.
   Calamity's punches do about 140 damage, and throwing arms around 200, 
   but since you can't heal your HP yet, they're not to be taken lightly. 
   Bad news is that he has a spread missile attack that hits for 450 damage 
   or so, but he doesn't do it often. Furthermore, he's quite slow, so with
   Booster on, you should be able to get in two actions per character for 
   each one of his. All in all, it shouldn't be too difficult.

   There'll be a sequence then, with Calamity coming back to life and Fei
   defeating it with an Infinite Level Skill (no, you don't get it now! :P).
   After that, go East and take the round path which leads to the side of
   the broken road. Jump on the platform, then onto the road and head South
   to exit the cave. The next scene will leave you on the Yggdrasil, Bart's 
   sand ship.


        =================================================
        E P I S O D E   9   :   P i r a t e ' s   L a i r
        =================================================


                        Y g g d r a s i l

   The Yggdrasil is quite big, and you'll be walking through it quite a lot,
   so get used to it as soon as possible. Check the map of it in the "Maps"
   section.

   The floor you're in is the lowest one, the hangar for Gears. Gears are
   stored in stands like the one Weltall is now in. You can approach these
   places and talk to the person in them to look at them (first and second
   options: look at the Gear's back or front) or ask them for information
   about the Gear (third option). Talk to the person to the South to rename
   it.
   There's also a Gear shop in this floor; it's the building at the East. It
   is quite important that you remember this, because it updates its stuff
   quite frequently and most of the time it has the most advanced equipment
   available where you are. Right now they have:

   Gear Engine:
   Z9-1500                1800

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-03000             1400

   Gear Armor:
   MS 9                   1500

   Gear Weapons:
   Iron GWhip             1600
   Snapper GWhip          2000

   Gear Parts:
   Resp Circuit           2500
   Def Circuit            2500
   C Circuit               250
   MagneticCoat           4000
   Lens Cover             2500
   Engine Guard           5000
   Tank Guard             3000
   Ar Repairer            4000
   Motion Guard           4000

   By now you should have enough money to get all the upgrades. If you have
   enough G get a MagneticCoat too: it'll improve your Response (Accuracy
   and Evade) quite a bit. The rest of the Gear parts are not too useful.

   Exit the hangar, then go straight North and enter the door to meet Maison
   again. Here you can buy items and character equipment, but sadly, he 
   does not update his stuff.

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Aquasol S               100
   Rosesol                 100
   Rosesol S               300
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   White Star              500
   Brown Star              500
   Red Star                500
   Blue Star               500
   Hard Star               800
   Speed Star             1000
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150
 
   Character Equipment:
   Power Ring              200
   Stamina Ring            150
   Speed Ring             1200
   Guardian Ring          2000

   I'd reccomend you get some Zetasol: they're the equivalent of Phoenix 
   Tails (recover from 0 HP condition). However, since in XenoGears such
   characters are recovered with 1 HP at the end of the battle, these items
   aren't as important as in FF games. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to
   keep some handy for hard boss battles. You should get some Aquasol S too.
   The rest of the items are a bit too expensive to justify their purchase
   for now. The problem with the Guardian Ring is that it doesn't show how
   much does it improve defense. I think it works like if you'd been cast a
   Defense Up effect.

   Regarding accesories, I specially like Speed Rings, and they're not that
   expensive either. According to Tatsushi Nakao, they also work when you're
   on your Gears!

   You can explore the Yggdrasil and become familiar with it (again, use the
   map). There are some things you can't do yet, though (like changing party
   members... it will be quite some time until you can). When you're done,
   go to the bridge. You can talk to the crew here, including Franz, a
   dolphin guy who can play random sound effects if you ask him. You can
   also check the ship's chart, with all the places you've visited.
   Afterwards, talk to Sigurd.


                  B a r t ' s   H i d e o u t

   Items in this area: Iron Whip

   After you arrive at Bart's base, follow Maison and Citan to the dining
   hall. There a scene will follow explaining the situation about Bart
   and Aveh's current leader, Shakhan, among others. After that, you can
   talk to the people in here. In the very dining hall there's a shop which
   sells:

   Aquasol                  20
   Aquasol S               100
   Rosesol                 100
   Rosesol S               300
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   White Star              500
   Brown Star              500
   Red Star                500
   Blue Star               500
   Hard Star               800
   Speed Star             1000
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   Exit the dining room, then go East to the electronics room. After the
   scene, you can explore the base at your leisure (actually, you also could
   before, but it's seems more fitting to do it now). To the North there are
   the quarters, in which you can rest and save. The West hallway leads to
   the World Map. Finally, the door to the South leads to Bart's room.
   There's a warning sign about not entering it, but ignore it ^_^; You can
   get an Iron whip for Bart, and when you try to exit, another scene will
   take place.

   After that, take the elevator down and try to enter the Yggdrasil. Bart
   will pop out and talk to you. After that, he'll tell you the mechanic
   wants to talk to you. So go to the base's Gear hangar then. You need to
   take an elevator which is in the same floor as the Yggdrasil's deck (it's
   on the opposite side of the elevator which leads to the base). Then, talk
   to the mechanic to trigger a scene.

   When it is over, go back to the quarters, save and rest there. After the
   scene, go down to the Yggdrasil, and a sequence will follow. Then, you'll
   have to fight some Gebler Force soldiers.

   Boss:
   Swordknight
     HP 700, Exp 1500, G 300.
     Gear-sized. Light red Gear with twin metallic whip-blades and a cannon
     for right hand.

   For this battle, you'll have Bart (in the Brigandier) and two of Bart's
   soldiers in some red Gears. Anyhow, it's so easy I won't even comment.

   Aegisknight
     HP 700, Exp 1500, G 300.
     Gear-sized. Big light blue Gear with two large shields.
     Uses "Pile Driver/Weaken Ar". Causes "Armor Damage".

   You have Citan in his brand-new Heimdall for this battle. Again, really
   easy.

   Wandknight x2
     HP 620, Exp 1500, G 200.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a large rifle.
     Uses "Power Beam/Beam Atk". Beam attack.

   For this battle you'll have both Citan and Bart. Easy too.

   Clawknight
     HP 600, Exp 1500, G 300.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a claw and a razor shield.

   Now it is Fei who comes to the rescue. This is really hard... OK, I was
   kidding. Piece of cake.

   Schpariel
     HP 4649, Exp 17890, G 1700. Leaves Beam Coat.
     Gear-sized. Huge, weird-looking round Gear.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Armor Damage" to two targets (can be the same
     one, doubling the amount of Armor Damage).

   You knew this was coming, huh? It's not that hard either, since you have
   all three good guys now. Just keep those T,T or T,S Skills and he'll be
   geography (um...).

   After this, there'll be more scenes, then you'll be in the Yggdrasil.

                     Y g g d r a s i l

   At this point, Citan will be able to use the Heimdal.

   Heimdal's initial equipment: Extra Ar +3, Old Circuit, Old Circuit.
   Engine : Z9-1500. Frame: HEIM-02500. Armor: MS 6.

   Talk to Sigurd in the bridge, and choose the first option to leave Bart's
   hideout. You'll be controlling the Yggdrasil, so refer to the "Playing
   the Game" section for details on how to control it. In any case, head for
   Aveh's capital, Bledavik. You'll have yo get off the Yggdrasil to enter,
   of course.


            W o r l d   M a p   ( B l e d a v i k   A r e a )

   Enemies in desert areas:
   Neo Tin Robo
     HP 438, Exp 1100, G 150. Leaves Extra Ar +1.
     Gear-sized. Same description as a Tin Robo. Blocky, construction
     type-looking Gear with a crane arm.
   Spear Trooper
     HP 600, Exp 1050, G 1000.
     Gear-sized. Yellow Gear with shield and forked spear.
   Trooper
   Sand Man

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Hobgob <brown>
   Lil' Kobold


                         B l e d a v i k

   Items in this area: H&S Badge

   Bledavik is so large (at last a city-sized city! ^_^) that it has its own
   map. However, upon entering the first section, a scene will follow
   introducing quite some new key characters. Once it is over, you'll be in
   the marketplace section of Bledavik.

   Is it just me, or the sign at the entrance says (more or less) "Welcome
   To Fiesta de Aveh" (Fiesta is "Party/Celebration" in Spanish)? Anyway,
   talk to a woman in blue just after entering: she'll give you the
   directions of an hotel.

   In a stall near the South gate you can buy Radishes at 10 G each; in
   another one deeper in the market you can get Ariberries for the same
   price; and finally, in a third stall you can buy Elfananas, again for
   10 G. Both Ariberries and Elfananas restore some HP when eaten outside
   battle, but since you get them one at a time you probably won't have the
   patience to get enough to use them consistently. I don't know if Radishes
   are of any use yet, though ^_^; You can obtain these goods at 9 or even 8
   G each if you bargain: thanks are in order to Stephen Xie Minggeng 
   (dayspring@stones.com) for this information. To bargain, don't select 
   anything when the dialog box with "Buy them"/"Don't buy them" pops up.
   After a short while, the seller will offer them for 9 G, and then for 8 G.
   If you wait any further, however, he/she will withdraw from the sale.

   In another stall you can sell any Fang, Eyeball or Scales you might have
   for 150, 300 and 600 G respectivelly. Their selling prices in a regular
   shop are 100, 200 and 500 G respectivelly, so it's a better deal. As far
   as I know there's no use for any of them other than that, so go ahead.
   Unless, of course, you want to save them and sell them in Kislev, for
   example, where they have better rates. For more information check
   "Selling Prices" under "Charts".


   Bledavik is quite a big place and at this point you should explore and
   enjoy it at your leisure. It's also one of my favorite cities in the
   game.


   There's a restaurant to the West of the market and a bit to the North
   (its door is in the same wall as the hotel's; a sign over it seems to
   spell "Marine" or "Mario's"). In it's second floor, you can talk to the
   waitress by the aquarium to order some food. There are three options:

   Something delicious: Recover full HP/EP, raises weith a bit, costs 300 G.
   Something cheap    : Recover some HP/EP, raises weith a lot, costs 90 G.
   Something fast     : Recover some HP/EP, raises weith a bit, costs 210 G.
   (additionally, and quite humorously, she'll run like mad if you order
   something fast ^_^).


   There's also an Ethos facility in the same wall as the restaurant, to the
   South. It has the Ethos symbol over it. In there you can buy:

   Resp Circuit           2500

   Motion Guard           4000

   Oddly enough, all this stuff is the same or worse of what you already had
   access to, so...


   In the southeastern part of the city there's also a weapon shop
   (unmistakably marked "Weapon"). There you'll be able to get:

   Character Equipment:
   Magical Rod              50
   Arcane Rod              100
   Iron Whip               120
   WhippaSnappa            280


   Also in the eastern wall, there's an armor shop.

   Character Equipment:
   Leather Vest            150
   Leather Hat              80
   Power Ring              200
   Speed Ring             1200

   You can also get the H&S Badge now instead of later (see below for
   details).

   When you're done, go to the hotel the woman in the entrance told you
   about. There you will be encountered by a nun sent by Nisan. You can
   rest here and even get a discount if you tell the owner you have a
   reccomendation. Tell the truth, i.e. that the woman didn't tell her name.
   In any case, you should go to the nun's room, and there you'll learn of
   the difficulty of accessing the castle where Margie is kept. So to the
   streets you go again to find some info. Head North to exit to Bleidavik's
   map, then enter Shakhan Square.


                    S h a k h a n   S q u a r e

   There's a camel-man (or something) selling toys at a stall. You can get
   a Toy Gun for 80 G or a Gear Figure (Minigear) for 120 G. If you buy the
   Minigear, you can give it to the eagle-boy near the stall, and in return
   he'll tell you about the Gold Nugget in the restaurant's aquarium (which
   you'll get a bit later). As far as I know, the Toy Gun has no use,
   however (but I bought it anyway).

   In another stall you can buy "Bartweiser" ^_^ beer (50 G, makes you gain
   weight and makes the camera wobble). After that, that same stall will
   sell Durian juice, Nisan Water and Aveh Water items, all for 10 G and
   with no use as far as I know (by now your inventory should be full of
   background items... I know mine is! ^_^).

   There's quite some more fun you can have here, including meeting Fox
   Mulder (not really ^_^); learning to breathe fire from the guy who
   breathes red fire (hold R2 and press Cross... it's fun!); buying some
   cakes (the spiced cakes cost 20 G and will make you gain weight, the iced
   ones will make you lose weight for 30 G, both with amusing side effects);
   getting a balloon in front of a tent which you can't enter just now...

   Anyhow, keep going North and Bart will tell you he must leave the party
   so he doesn't get recognized by Shakhan's forces. Do so, then go North
   to enter Fatima Castle's section.


                    T o u r n a m e n t   A r e n a

   Citan will tell you about entering the tournament to distract the guards
   while Bart slips in. So off to the counter you go. You'll be able to
   enter a nickname by combining one of four adjectives with one of four
   nouns. Choose whatever you like the most, then go back to Bledavik.


                           B l e d a v i k
   
   Now go to the East wall of the market. Walk either to the northern
   stairs and go South, or the southern stairs and go North. You'll find
   some people near a grate. Talk to the man nearest to it and he should
   tell you about the underground waterways. Once you've done this, you can
   do one of two things. Either you go back to the hotel and enter the nun's
   room, in which you'll put together a course of action, or you talk to the
   hiding boy (see below). Once you've done one of those things, go back to
   the old man near the grate and talk to him. Choose either the second or
   the third choice and he'll give the key to you.
   
   However, let's pause here for a while so you can get the H&S Badge (Hide
   and Seek Badge). Full credit for how to obtain it is due to Beth
   (BIZAROELNE@aol.com). The following section was originally written by
   Beth and slightly edited by me:

There is an extra part in Bledavik where you can get a "Hide and Seek" badge
from the boy from the armor shop. Go to the East well and talk to the little
boy hanging around the old lady that talks about the laundry. He'll ask if
you want to play. You then have to find the little boy from the armor shop.
(He's the one who hid in the well and tells you where you can find the key).

1. The first time he is hiding, you will find him up the stairs out in the
open where the two kids that steal from the woman merchant go (below the kid
who is standing on the rooftop who talks about his brother in the war).
The easiest way to get there is through a gap in the stalls in the West wall
of the market. The gap can be easily seen because it has a red stripped
broken marquee over it.

2. You will find him in the North gate of Bledavik's market area, just
before you actually go to Shakhan Square. Rotate the screen until you see
him standing on the East side.

3. Next he hides behind the barrels to the South of the hotel, in the
Southwest corner.

4. You will find him next under the doorway that's just South of the
restaurant door. You have to rotate the screen view otherwise you'll miss
him. He is on the left side of the doorway.

5. At this point he'll say "Aw gee, you found me here too?!" And he says
something about a "secret hiding place". This time he hides in a very
difficult spot. You will find him on the left hand side where the lady tells
you about the hotel and welcomes you to Bledavik. Up in the East corner of
the screen there is a hidden part where you can walk a few paces to the
North, behind the building, and keep hitting the X button until you find
him. Rotate the screen if you have to.

After you have found him in the corner, he gives you his "Hide and Seek"
badge, and says he's not playing anymore, and that "you shouldn't either,
you are too old for the game" or something to that effect.

   OK, back to Ignacio. As far as I know, you can't get the H&S Badge later
   in the game, just as you can't get the RPS Badge after Lahan. I may be
   wrong, as I'm not that far into the game, but it would seem logical for
   this badge to follow the same trend as the previous one.

   Also, the first time I played the American version, I talked to the boy
   but he didn't tell me anything about the key at all, and I didn't talk to
   him after speaking with the guy by the well: I just went back to the
   hotel, Bart said we should find the key, I spoke again with the guy near
   the well and he gave the key to me like that.

   But what's even more strange is that the second time, I didn't speak with
   the hiding boy; instead, another one told me he was looking for him. I
   then found him in the first three hiding points, and he'd make all his
   long speech about the waterway each time (believe me, it got quite
   boring... it almost looked like it was a bug in the game). Then I went to
   the guy by the well and he gave me the key. What this seems to mean is
   that you can do any one of these two things (talk to the hiding boy or go
   back to the hotel) to get the guy by the well (G.B.T.W. by now ^_^;) to
   give you the key.

   Now go back to the hotel once more. Talk to the nun, and Citan and Bart
   will leave your party. Now, you could talk to either Citan or Bart and
   choose to rest, and it would advance the story, but don't do that just
   yet. Instead, go back to Shakhan Square.

   Remember the tent you couldn't enter? You can enter it now, and the blue
   guys in here will allow you to play a couple of sub-games, called "Merry
   Go Pop" and "Whose Balloons", for 10 G each. They will be covered in a
   future sub-games section of the FAQ; however, about the best thing you
   can get are Physimentsol, so don't worry too much about them. They're
   fun, though, and not a bad way of making money. Also, you can enter a
   third door for 10 G which leads to a mirror in which you can see yourself
   reflected. The reflection will be wider or thinner depending on your
   character's current weight.

   Once you're done with the mini-games, head back to the hotel and talk
   to Citan or Bart and choose to rest. The next morning, Citan will brief
   you on the plan. So go to the Fatima Castle section, where the tournament
   is being held.


        =====================================================
        E P I S O D E   1 1   :   T h e   T o u r n a m e n t
        =====================================================


                    T o u r n a m e n t   A r e n a

   Talk to one of the guards to enter the tournament grounds, then head
   northeast and talk to yet another guard. Citan will leave at this point.

   Now, if you rotate the camera so that "up" is southeast or southwest,
   and approach the castle tower, you can see Shakhan on top of it! In the
   west tent there are some participants, including Big Joe (yes, he fights
   in this tournament). Enter the East tent and to your surprise, you'll
   find Dan here. After talking to him and a mysterious man, the control
   will switch over to Bart.


                           B l e d a v i k   

   As Bart, exit the hotel and enter the waterway. You can access it from
   any of the two wells (there's one to the East and another to the West),
   but by all means use the western one (just a little South of the hotel).
   It allows for a shorter route and on top of that it allows you to get
   most items along the way.

   The scene will switch to the tournament again, and Fei'll face his first
   opponent.

   Boss:
   Gonzalez
     HP 400, Exp 500, G 0. Leaves Survival Tent.
     Character-sized. Gray fat guy with a mace.
     Uses "Can't take it anymore!". Physical attack combo for around 60
     damage. Gonzalez will use this attack in his turn whenever you use a
     Skill in yours.

   If you lose against this or any of your subsequent opponents, the game
   will not be over (this is a tournament, after all). However, once you are
   eliminated from the tournament (or if beat your opponent too early, see
   below), there will be a lot more guards in Fatima Castle, making Bart's
   task harder. Besides, you'll miss part of the story since you won't fight
   Dan or Wiseman.

   However, there's more to these fights than just that. You see, remember
   that Citan said that the longer the fight last, the more time the guards
   will be distracted? Well, he wasn't kidding you. If you make the fight
   last long enough, the number of guards in Bart's section (Fatima Castle
   to be precise) will be significantly decreased, thus Bart will be able to 
   sneak through the castle without having to fight a single guard.

   OK, back to the fight. Disregard what I said about making the fight last
   for this round, Bart will most likely not be able to reach Fatima Castle
   before the next fight.
   Beware of this guy. His "Can't take it anymore!" combo can make you kiss
   the floor if he uses it three times, which is less than you need to kill
   him. However, his regular attack deals about 30 damage, so it's not worth
   using regular attacks (which inflict little damage) just because of that.
   What I did was to use "Senretsu", he did his special, I used "Senretsu",
   he did his special, I used "Inner Healing", he did a regular attack, and
   then I did Senretsu two times in a row, because my Agility was superior
   to his. Another thing you can try is build up your AP bar and unleash a
   powerful combo.

   Whether you beat Gonzalez or not, the menu screen will automatically
   appear now. If you're wondering, this is so you can heal. Do so. Of
   course, you can change your equipment, etc... too (but strangely, not
   save).

   Once you exit this menu screen, you will be in control of Bart, which
   is swimming through the waterway to reach Fatima Castle. However, control
   from now on switches back and forth from Fei to Bart (once he wins or
   loses each fight) and from Bart to Fei (this happens at regular intervals
   of time) so I will just list all of Fei's opponents and then everything
   Bart has to do.

   Boss:
   Big Joe
     HP 912, Exp 1, G 1. Leaves Metal Vest.
     Character-sized. Elvis-like green-haired character (like if you didn't
     know what Big Joe looks like already).
     Uses "Grrrreat!". Dash punch for 1 damage.
     Uses "Grrrreat!", "And dynamic!". Double dash punches for 2 damage ^_^
     Uses "Joe's fans attack". Sometimes when you attack Big Joe, the crowd
     will throw objects at you for about 60 HPs worth of physical damage.
     Uses "Joe's fans cheer support". Sometimes when you attack Big Joe, the
     crowd will cheer him and heal him 140 HPs.

   It's very easy to stall (for the reason mentioned above) this fight. Just
   defend; Big Joe's attacks are rather sad.

   The only danger in this fight comes from the crowd, and since they won't
   attack unless you do, this fight shouldn't be too hard. Just remember to
   heal often. Big Joe has quite some HP, however, and when he gets low on
   life the crowd will heal him often (but not always). You might also want
   to consider building up your AP storage meter (by doing single Triangle
   attacks), then bring him down to about 400 HP using Skills, and then
   unleash a 28-AP combo to finish him.

   By the way, be sure to equip the Metal Vest that Big Joe leaves as soon
   as you beat him (once the menu screen pops up).

   Boss:
   Scud
     HP 300 (of a maximum of 350), Exp 500, G 0. Leaves Samson's Hair.
     Character-sized. Green-robed hermit-looking character with long orange
     hair and a backpack.
     Uses "Strange Pill". Has no effect.
     Uses "Strange Pill". Lowers Attack.
     Uses "Strange Pill". Causes "Poison".
     Uses "Strong Pill". Raises Defense.
     Uses "Strong Pill". Raises Agility.
     Uses "Happy Pill". Recover 200 HP.

   It's not too hard to stall this fight either. The best way to do so, and
   at the same time beat Scud easily when needed, is to charge up your AP
   meter. You remember how it was done, don't you? Just use a Triangle
   attack, then press Circle to cancel the string. When you're at 28 AP, I
   reccomend you take advantage of this fight to learn any Skill Fei hasn't
   learned yet. Typically, this would be Hagan (Square, Circle). Since Scud
   heals and evades most of your attacks, you can keep losing time this way
   (heal occasionally). When you're tired (20-30 rounds should be enough),
   unleash a combo and fry Scud (remember to use "Iron Valor" first).

   Boss:
   Dan
     HP 450, Exp 500, G 5.
     Character-sized. Big-headed boy (how else could I describe Dan? ^_^;)
     Uses "I'm gonna take you down!". Does nothing.
     Uses "This is for all of Lahan!". Physical attack for about 20 HP.
     Uses "This is for Timothy!". Physical attack for about 20 HP.
     Uses "This is for my sister!". Physical attack for about 20 HP.
     Uses "You scum!". Huge energy blast for about 100 HP of Ether damage.

   Where did Dan learn to make these kind of fireworks? OK, OK, so
   apparently everyone but me tried to see whether if something happened if
   you didn't attack him, and wouldn't you know it, something does actually
   happen! If you don't attack him but defend or heal instead, he won't use
   "You scum!" (I think), and after quite some rounds of beating you, he'll
   realize Fei doesn't want to fight him (Fei : "There's no way I could ever
   bring myself to strike you"... yeah, right ^_^), and he'll give you
   Alice's Wedding Dress.

   Thanks for this tip are due to: Shalloween (Shalloween@aol.com), 
   Andy Schiestl (ajs2916@unix.tamu.edu), Yao (amici@the.net.ph) and
   Patrick Miller (pmiller@cis.ysu.edu).

   Should you decide the little guy's signed his death sentence when he
   challenged you (just kidding... his reaction is only logical), here's how
   to beat him. Well, he has quite a high Defense rating, so it'll take a
   while to beat him. Use Iron Valor as soon as the battle begins; due to
   Dan's high defense, it will double the damage you inflict (the reasoning
   being a little too long to explain here). Don't ever let your HP drop
   below 100, because if he uses "You scum!" (now that's a name for a
   technique), you're toast. Keep hammering with "Senretsu" (or whatever
   you've got) and heal with "Inner Healing" or Aquasol S.
   On a side note, the second time I reached this part, he only did about
   5 HP of damage with each attack. I first though it might be because of
   me not attacking him, but it doesn't seem that way. Since I had the same
   armor, etc... I don't know why this could be. Cyan Garamonde
   (shenancalhar@hotmail.com) brought my attention over this too...

   Also, assuming you want to get the Wedding Dress, you can't control the
   duration of this match. It will be long, however: Dan is as stubborn as
   big-headed (same word in Spanish, in fact ^_^;).

   Boss:
   Wiseman
     HP 999, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Ominous-looking man with blue cape and hood, and a
     white mask. Wiseman evades all physical attacks and receives minimum
     damage from Ether attacks.

   As you can imagine, there's no way in which you can beat him. He doesn't
   attack you either, and after a while of talking he will leave.


                   B l e d a v i k   W a t e r w a y

   Items in this area: Gold Nugget, Survival Tent, Rosesol S, Aquasol S

   There is a map of the waterway in the "Maps" section of the FAQ: I'd
   reccomend you check it out. BTW, I'm assuming you entered the waterway
   via the West well.
   You'll have to swim northeastward against the current. You can and should
   hold Circle button to swim faster; however, the current will sometimes
   rise in strenght and make you go backwards: in most of such cases, you
   can release both the Circle button and the control pad, then hold them
   again to regain your speed.

   In the junction, continue straight to the northeast. Climb the pipe and
   jump when you're at the top of it: this will lead you to the famous
   restaurant aquarium, in which you can finally get hold of the Gold Nugget
   within the chest. After that, press the Cross button to descend.

   Keep swimming northeast, then North and this time go southeast at the
   junction. Get the Rosesol S and head back to the junction, and take the
   North way again. At the next crossroad, you could take the northeast path
   to get a Survival Tent, but it's quite a long way and, well, it's just a
   survival tent ^_^.

   So take the northwest path instead. Then, take the south way in the next
   one. Get the Aquasol S and head back North. Keep going North, then
   northeast. At the four way junction, you can go South if you want to
   climb a pipe that leads to the interior of the fountain in Shakhan
   Square. This has no practical usefulness, but it looks fun ^_^.

   In any case, head straight North and you'll enter Fatima Castle.

   Items in this area: Cobra Cracka, Iron Mail x4, Aquasol S, Hob Meat, 
     Hob Jerky x2.

   Enemies in this area:
   Aveh Guard <soldier>
     HP 80, Exp 242, G 45. Leaves Aquasol.
     Character-sized. Same description as an Aveh Soldier. Soldier with
     brown helmet and aviation glasses on.
   Aveh Guard <corporal>
     HP 80, Exp 242, G 45. Leaves Aquasol.
     Character-sized. Same description as an Aveh Corporal. Bigger soldier
     with white helmet and aviation glasses on his head.

   Get out of the pool climbing the ladder to the East. Talk to the old man
   for a lenghty conversation, then save in the Memory Cube. You can close
   the flood gate using the switch at the other end of the bridge, but I
   don't know if that's of any use.

   Climb the ladder and you'll be in the middle of the castle's inner
   garden. From now on there will be guards patrolling the castle (their
   numbers depending on how good did you do with Fei at the tournament).
   If you have played Metal Gear Solid, you'll feel at home: they have a
   vision cone too, and if they see you, they'll run to your encounter.
   They don't activate any alarm though. Besides, they're really easy.

   OK, here's how to proceed. Head to the South of the inner garden. You
   should see two guards, and after them, a large wooden door. There's no
   way you can sneak past these guards, so run like mad between them. If
   you're fast enough, you'll be able to reach the door before they can
   recover from the surprise: quickly press X and you'll cross it. They
   won't follow you into the castle, and in fact if you come back to the
   garden (which you will right now), they won't remember about you ^_^;
   So go back to the garden.

   The doors in the West wall lead to the dinning room and the kitchen. 
   Contrary to what I formerly said, it seems there are items in the 
   kitchen. There are two Hob-Jerkys and one Hob-Meat hanging from the
   ceiling near the North wall of the kitchen: you can get them by jumping
   up when below them. The Jerkys are easy to get but the Meat needs some
   accuracy. Thanks for this info go to Bryan H (fallingasleep@hotmail.com).
   BTW, you can get these items later, but it will be QUITE later ^_^;

   One cool thing is that whenever you open a door from the castle to the 
   inner garden, you can take a peek out to see if there are any guards.
   You can use this to exit when no guards are looking if you're patient
   enough.

   The southernmost door of the East wall leads to a room in which you can
   get the Cobra Cracka for Bart. It has one point less of Attack power than
   the Whippa Snappa you can buy in Bledavik's weapon shop, but it poisons
   enemies, so I'd reccomend you equip it.

   The middle door of the East wall leads to a room with nothing of interest
   (except the amazing level of detail that's usual in Xenogears).

   The North door of the East wall leads to the armory. You can pick up the
   four armors standing in bars near the entrance: they're Iron Mails. Equip
   one right away, and remember to equip the rest on Fei and Citan when you
   can. If you talk to the guard, he won't pay attention to you, but when
   you head to the door he will notice and pursue you to fight. It's really
   easy to exit without fighting him, however (and why is it that every
   single guard you fight is in fact two? Instantaneous mithosis?).

   Since all three North doors are locked, you only have the South door
   remaining. So go back again through it to the main hall. The South door
   leading outside is locked too, so go up the stairs.
   The door in the northwest leads to a room with a guy in it, but nothing
   of interest. Same goes for it's northeast counterpart. You can't cross
   the curtains to the South since they lead to the tournament's arena. Take
   the North door then.

   You'll be in a balcony surrounding the inner garden. There will be quite
   some guards here even if Fei wasn't eliminated in the tournament. The
   first door to the West leads to the library, in which you can learn about
   Aveh's foundation (more interesting than you might think), and that
   winners write history. The other two doors lead to a room with nothing
   worth of remark except the castle's bishop.

   The first door to the East leads to a sort of special weapons room with
   the recently unearthed weapon Shakhan was talking about with Ramsus. The
   other two lead to a room packed with guards, but take the northernmost
   one since you'll sneak behing a wall and be able to overhear their
   conversation. There's also an Aquasol S in this room. To get it, you'll
   have to pass near the guards, and they'll pursue you. It is possible to
   get out of the room without them getting you (I did it, but so barely
   that the battle BGM was playing when the game was loading the garden
   section ^_^;).

   If you follow either wall to the North, you'll reach a door leading
   to the interior of the castle again (it doesn't matter which side you go
   through). To the North there is a large dinning, but what you have to do
   is climb the stairs to the third floor.

   North of the third floor is a bedroom with (you guessed it) nothing of
   interest. If you go upstairs and cross the door to the North (you'll have
   to fight two guards), you'll be in Shakhan's room. But there's nothing
   here, right? Wrong. If you press Cross in front of the green bottle to
   the East, a panel will slide revealing a screen which is connected to a
   camera system throughout the castle. After picking a location, you can
   move the view around with the control pad and even zoom in and out with
   the Square and Circle buttons. You can see that Margie's in the East
   Tower, so there we go (actually, it's the only place left).

   Go downstairs to the third floor and head to the door that's to the East.
   You'll be in a room with an elevator that doesn't work and another door
   after a corridor to the North. Here you will find Margie at last.

   Save in the Memory Cube and go back to the room with the corridor.
   However, upon crossing it Ramsus and Miang will appear. For this battle,
   you'll have Margie helping you.

   Boss:
   Ramsus
     HP 400, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Blue-clad knight type with sword.
     Uses "Mirror Stance/predict atk". Ramsus will adopt a defensive stance.
     All physical attacks will miss while he's in that stance. Additionally,
     he'll counterattack for about 130 HP of damage if he's attacked.
   Miang
     HP 999, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Blue-haired girl dressed in white. Cannot be targeted
     by anyone.
     Uses "Restore". Restores 40 HP to Ramsus.
     Uses "Remove Status". If Ramsus has been affected with Status Effects,
     Miang will use this to heal him.
   Margie
     HP 9999, Exp N/A, G N/A.
     Character-sized. Girl with a red cape. Cannot be targeted by anyone.
     Uses "Good luck Bart!". Randomly restores 0, 20 or 40 HP to Bart.

   Don't count on Margie too much. In any case, Ramsus is not too hard if
   you know you mustn't attack him when he's in his Mirror Stance. If you
   do, he'll slash the stuffing out of you. Take advantage of the time he's
   in that stance to heal. You can also attack him with Ether attacks,
   thanks to Cyan Garamonde (shenancalhar@hotmail.com) for pointing this
   out. Having the Cobra Cracka helps a lot, because it will poison Ramsus
   sometimes, and Miang will waste her turn healing him.

   After inflicting 400 points of damage upon Ramsus, Fei will join the fun.

   Boss:
   Ramsus
     HP 800, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Blue-clad knight type with sword.
     Uses "Mirror Stance/predict atk". Ramsus will adopt a defensive stance.
     All physical attacks will miss while he's in that stance. Additionally,
     he'll counterattack for about 130 HP of damage if he's attacked.
   Miang
     HP 999, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Blue-haired girl dressed in white. Cannot be targeted
     by anyone.
     Uses "Restore". Restores 100 HP to Ramsus.
   Margie
     HP 9999, Exp N/A, G N/A.
     Character-sized. Girl with a red cape. Cannot be targeted by anyone.
     Uses "Good luck Bart!". Randomly restores 0 or 20 HP to Bart.
     Uses <No Name>. Randomly restores 0 or 20 HP to Fei.

   To make up for Fei's presence, Ramsus has twice as much HP, he can't be
   poisoned, Miang now heals 100 HP and Margie no longer heals 40 HP. Still,
   I didn't find this battle as hard as some people say. The only thing that
   can really be a pain is when Ramsus stays in the Mirror Stance and Miang
   keeps healing him... even using Ether attacks on him, she'll heal faster
   that you can hurt him. In any case, just use your best Skills and heal
   via Fei's "Inner Healing", and he should be defeated.

   Once he's down, you'll all escape thanks to Margie. After exiting the
   elevator, go East through the hallway. Another sequence will follow, in
   which you'll finally escape thanks to Elly.

   Items in this area: Ether Veiler.

   You'll be on the deck of the Yggdrasil now. Enter it, then press Cross
   in front of Chu-chu (the pink little one who's in front of the bridge's
   door). Bart will tell you to ask Margie to take it from there, so go to
   her room (check the map, it's near the Gear hangar). You'll have to input
   a name for it ("Chu-Chu" is the default). Then you'll realize it isn't a
   stuffed toy at all but a living being. Before you leave this room, if you
   got the Spider in Lahan Mountain, you can give it to Chu-Chu (talk to
   her) and she'll give you an Ether Veiler in exchange.

   After that, go to the bridge and talk to Sigurd twice. He'll tell you to
   pilot the Yggdrasil to the path to Nisan, which is marked by a single
   tree in the desert. It's all the way to the North from Bart's Lair, just
   follow the West coastline and you'll reach it. Enter the road to Nisan
   while still in the Yggdrasil, and it will sink into the sand and cross
   the sea.

   Nisan, like Aveh, is quite a big city and has its own map. If you exit
   Nisan you'll be in the World Map (obviously).

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Hobgob <brown>
   Lil' Kobold

   Enemies in desert area:
   Sand Shark
   Neo Tin Robo

   Not much to do here, but it's my obligation to put the enemies you can
   find here, so... ^_^ We now continue with your scheduled programme. :)


                            N i s a n

   Enter the city section from Nisan's map. Even this section is quite big
   and it's easier to get lost than in Bledavik. The first house to the West
   as you enter is an inn, in which you can't rest now, but its owner will
   give you some tea which will make you lose weight, in return.

   You can enter the house that is northeast just besides the stairs. After
   some conversation, you can buy the following from their owners:

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Aquasol S               100
   Rosesol                 100
   Rosesol S               300
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150
 
   Character Equipment:
   Power Ring              200
   Stamina Ring            150
   Speed Ring             1200
   Guardian Ring          2000
   Holy Pendant           8000
   Life Stone            20000
   Ether Doubler         38000

   The new Accesories are quite interesting, but they're REALLY expensive
   and most likely you won't have much money about now anyway. You can also
   find one of Bart's crew in here, which will sell you the following from
   the Yggdrasil:

   Gear Engine:
   Z9-1500                1800

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-03000             1400

   Gear Armor:
   MS 9                   1500

   Gear Weapons:
   Iron GWhip             1600
   Snapper GWhip          2000

   Gear Parts:
   Resp Circuit           2500
   Def Circuit            2500
   C Circuit               250
   MagneticCoat           4000
   Lens Cover             2500
   Engine Guard           5000
   Tank Guard             3000
   Ar Repairer            4000
   Motion Guard           4000

   If you go further to the northwest, you'll find the town hall. You can't
   enter it but you can overhear a conversation about the state of things.

   Anyhow, go downstairs and to the North to meet with Margie. Talk to the
   person in front of the gate, then to Magie and head North to the
   monastery.


                   N i s a n   M o n a s t e r y

   After the scene (wow! Even the sisters have character development!),
   you'll have to follow Margie through the monastery. She's in a door to
   the East. Follow her upstairs, then talk to her again. More character
   development (nice idea the bit about the two angels... and how it goes
   entirelly over Bart's head ^_^).
   Afterwards, follow Margie to the northmost door (skip the other door for
   now) and up the stairs. Here you'll see a beautiful drawing of Sophia
   (that has been my Windows 95 wallpaper for the last few months ^_^), and
   the usual does of mystery will be thrown at you.

   Go back the way you came here, but enter the door you skipped. Talk to
   the sisters here if you want, then to Agnes (I think this is optional,
   though).

   You can exit the monastery now, but note there are some people downstairs
   now you might want to talk to.
   

                            N i s a n

   Back in Nisan's city section, go to the South exit. However, before
   reaching it, Maison will call you from a house's door. Enter that house,
   and you'll have the chance to know quite a lot more about Solaris. After
   asking about the four possible topics, you'll be given the chance to
   repeat any of them if you want. After this, you can talk to Sigurd and
   Maison if you want (Maison will say he knew about Sigurd having been in
   Solaris).

   Exit the house, then go to the bridge that's just behind the house you
   bought all that stuff from. Talk to Bart there. More scenes (isn't the
   translation wonderful? Ahh...), then go to the town hall. Citan, Sigurd
   and Bart will elaborate a strategy for liberating Aveh (and quite a risky
   one too!).

   The next morning, talk to Bart and tell him you're ready. After some
   scenes (and a FMV), you'll be back in the Yggdrasil.

                        Y g g d r a s i l

   As Citan, talk to Maison to cheer him up a little (you can also buy from
   him, but he doesn't have anything new). Save, then head to the highest
   floor of the Yggdrasil and climb the ladder leading outside.


             K i s l e v   B o r d e r   M o u n t a i n

   Items in this area: Extra Ar+2, MagneticCoat, Gold Nugget, Rosesol S.

   Enemies in this area:
   Medusoid
   May Fly
   Nomad Fix Bot
   Edelweiss
     HP 815, Exp 880, G 0. Leaves Fang.
     Gear-sized. Blue and yellow vaguelly reptilian animal with a
     flower-like head.

   The enemies in this dungeon are just weaklings ("Medusoids? Gimme a
   break... I fought them in the FIRST dungeon!").

   Go East and climb the ledge. Jump to the southwest ledge then grab the
   Extra Ar+2 and equip it. Go back northeast, then jump to the ledge to
   the North (your Gear can jump more than it seems). Climb the platform to
   the northwest, then jump to the one to the southeast. Follow this one to
   the South and get the MagneticCoat from the chest. Equip it instead of
   the Old Circuit, if you still have it. Go back all the way to the North,
   then jump up the ledge to the northeast and enter the cave. 

   There must be some problem with the compass, because now it seems like if
   you came FROM the northeast! ^_^ In any case, continue to the southwest,
   and when you have a platform behind you to the East, jump to it from the
   one that's more or less at its level. It's a very tight jump, but it
   will save a lot of time, not to mention some jumps (if you can't make it,
   you can just go West, North and then East).

   In any case, keep going up (Northeast, then north). At the junction, go
   East. Climb a ledge and get the Rosesol S. Go back West, keep going
   northwest, jump over the crevice and get the Gold Nugget. Keep climbing
   North, jump over the crevice to the East, and climb up where the Repair
   Bot is. Talk to him and he'll offer the following:

   Gear Engine:
   Z9-1500                1800

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-03000             1400

   Gear Armor:
   MS 9                   1500

   Gear Weapons:
   Iron GWhip             1600
   Snapper GWhip          2000

   Gear Parts:
   Resp Circuit           2500
   Def Circuit            2500
   C Circuit               250
   MagneticCoat           4000
   Lens Cover             2500
   Engine Guard           5000
   Tank Guard             3000
   Ar Repairer            4000
   Motion Guard           4000

   Sounds familiar, huh? Sigh. At least, you can replenish your HP and fuel
   here. Don't tell him you don't trust him, or you'll have to fight him!
   Save in the Memory Cube, then go through the exit to the North. What's up
   with that damn compass!! Now it's like if you just exited FROM the North!
   Note also that you seem to be facing the right direction, i.e. North in
   this case, though it's where you came from. Strange...

   In any case, go East and a sequence will follow. Our girl Elhaym's
   squadron will attack you now (Hey guys, didn't you hear your commander?
   Take it easy!).

   Boss:
   Wandknight x2
     HP 620, Exp 1500, G 200. Leaves Extra Ar+2.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a large rifle.
     Uses "Power Beam/Beam Atk". Beam attack.

   These guys are just as worthless as before (worse in fact, because you're
   on a higher level now).

   Boss:
   Clawknight
     HP 600, Exp 1500, G 300.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a claw and a razor shield.
   Swordknight
     HP 700, Exp 1500, G 300.
     Gear-sized. Light red Gear with twin metallic whip-blades and a cannon
     for right hand.
   Aegisknight
     HP 700, Exp 1500, G 300. Leaves Extra Ar+2.
     Gear-sized. Big light blue Gear with two large shields.
     Uses "Pile Driver/Weaken Ar". Causes "Armor Damage".

   Even when they're three against one, these guys aren't much of a
   challenge: however, they're at least not as pitiful. Take out the
   Swordknight first, since it's the one who does the most damage; and the
   Aegisknight the last, since it's the toughest and the one that does the
   least damage. If the Aegisknight pesters you too much with "Pile Driver",
   use "Inner Healing" to recover the lost armor. Actually, the point of
   this fight is to weaken you for what's coming next, and that, those guys
   do well.

   After learning more about that mysterious incident Elly remembered about
   in the Blackmoon Forest, you'll have to fight her.

   Boss:
   Vierge   
     HP 2400, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. White and pink female-looking Gear.
     Uses "Aerod/Eth Atk". Ether attack for about 300 damage.

   Fortunatelly, her regular attacks aren't very powerful. Unfortunatelly,
   the Aerods are, and you don't have any way to heal yourself yet. Use
   booster and keep hitting her with "Reppu". You'll win eventually.

   You'll appear near the Memory Cube again, but this time you can keep
   climbing to the summit. Keep going up, and West / East alternativelly
   until you reach a very bright spot. Upon walking over it, a scene will
   trigger.


                   F a t i m a   C a s t l e

   As Bart and Citan, head up the ladder. There'll be another sequence (I
   hate to sound so dumb ^_^;, but I don't want to spoil anything
   unnecesarily).


        =====================================================
        E P I S O D E   1 6   :   D e s e r t   D e s p a i r

                        Y g g d r a s i l

   Just save and exit the room.


              K i s l e v   B o r d e r   D e s e r t

   Enemies in this area:
   Sand Tripper
     HP 180, Exp 550, G 110.
     Gear-sized. Yellow Gear with sort of skies and a machinegun.
   Gigafoot
     HP 500, Exp 320, G 220. Leaves C Circuit.
     Gear-sized. Yellow four-legged Gear with a back-mounted cannon. Stands
     on two legs once it is inflicted 60 or more damage.
   Trooper

   Welcome to the desert attack mini-game! You have to dodge the mines
   (-15 HP... Oh! The pain! ^_^), the shoots from the ships (-1 HP each
   time... I'll live too) and the enemy Gears, which will attack you on
   contact (the taller ones are two Sand Trippers, the shorter ones are
   a Giga Foot, sometimes with two Troopers). Your mission is basically to
   go West, then... to go West.

   After that, it's boss time against the so talked about Kefeinzel Gun.

   Boss:
   Main Gun
     HP 1800, Exp 7000, G 0. Leaves Gold Nugget.
     Gear-sized. LARGE cannon (remember you're in a Gear!).
     Uses "Readying Kefeinzel Gun!". Does nothing (yet).
     Uses "Clear the deck!". Does nothing (still).
     Uses "5". Does nothing (but giving you a bad feeling).
     Uses "4". Does nothing (but making you nervous).
     Uses "3". Does nothing (but making you want to be elsewhere).
     Uses "2". Does nothing (but making you wonder how many HP does the darn
     cannon have remaining).
     Uses "1". Does nothing (but scaring the hell out of you).
     Uses "Firing Kefeinzel Gun!". Does about 400 damage (that's all? Boo).
  Small Gun x2
     HP 590, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Smaller turret-like cannon. It's the only
     character-sized enemy that's made of polygons in the entire game.

   Sorry about the countdown thing, but if you want to be methodic, you have
   to be methodic, and a little humour was in order to make it less boring.
   Right. So stop with the tomatoes will ya!!
   Anyway, considering that the small cannons do like 1 damage, that I could
   have beaten the cannon while it was on "2" or so (I wanted to see what it
   did), and that it just deals 400 damage after all that buildup, you'd
   have to be really bad to lose this fight. Ignore the Small Guns, they'll
   be destroyed automatically after the Main Gun's down. 

   But wait! Vanderkaum's not over yet!

   Boss:
   Dora
     HP 3000, Exp 13393, G 2000. Leaves Extra Ar+3.
     Gear-sized. Huge, scary-looking thing with turrets and pincers.
     Uses "I'll kill you!". If he's got any of Bart's soldiers in his
     pincers when he's attacked, he will counterattack for about 140 damage
     with each one of them.
     Uses "Head cover broken, Def DOWN". Dora's defense will be lowered.
     He will use this after he's hit about eight times (whether they do
     damage or not).

   Dora does actually put up quite a fight. The first thing to remember is
   not to attack him when he's got any of the soldiers in his pincers
   (especially when he's got both). Attack with the soldiers too even though
   they'll do zero damage, you'll break his head cover.

   Once you break it, it's show time! Turn on Fei's booster and attack with
   all your party. The bad news is that the cannon does quite a lot of
   damage (about 600 on the soldiers and 400 on Fei), but if Fei was in
   good condition before the start of the fight (i.e. you didn't get hit by
   the Kefeinzel Gun), he should live long enough. However, because
   Vanderkaum attacks Fei most of the times, it IS possible that the
   soldiers will survive Fei. They're capable of finishing Dora, so don't
   give up!


                   A v e h   A r e a   D e s e r t 

   More sequences, then Bart will try to take on a quite formidable foe.

   Boss:
   ?
     HP 99999, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Red, KEEEEWL looking Gear (the coolest in the game, IMHO),
     with metal wings that extend into six energy wings.
     Uses "Kishin". Energy palm combo for 19998 damage.

   Do you think you can win this battle? I thought so. His coolness alone
   could shred you to pieces ^_^;

   After you're pummeled, one of the game's coolest scenes will take place.
   Then, you'll be able to save your game if you want. Some more scenes,
   then you'll wake up at...

   Save in the Memory Cube, and get ready for the fight. You don't need to

   defeat will determine which rank you get, which will affect the

   Prices at which you can sell monster parts at the Ethos facility.
   The dish you get when you order a "dish a la rank".

   However, since A) the mentioned prices will rise to the "Battler Class"
   prices eventually and B) dishes a la rank don't do much actually, I don't
   think rank is all that important. In any case, here we go.

   Boss:
   Leonardo
     HP 500, Exp 300, G 150.
     Character-sized. Same description as Forest Elf. Brown humanoid.

   Er, hasn't this guy changed a bit for the battle? Anyhow, keep attacking
   him with your best Skill. He doesn't do much damage, and in three or four
   rounds he'll be down.

   Boss:
   Heinrich
     HP 500, Exp 300, G 150.
     Character-sized. Same description as Forest Elf. Brown humanoid.

   Are these guys clones? At least he uses a different attack (that does
   20 damage instead of 15). He's prety easy too.

   Boss:
   Vargas
     HP 500, Exp 300, G 150.
     Character-sized. Same description as Forest Elf. Brown humanoid.

   This one combines the attacks from the previous two. Not too difficult
   either, but remeber to heal when needed. He's faster too, and he does
   almost two attacks for each one of yours, but this extra attack is
   usually an uppercut that does 6 damage.

   Boss:
   Suzarn
     HP 800, Exp 500, G 0. Leaves Metal Jacket.
     Character-sized. Witch-like looking girl with a menacingly big scythe.
     Uses <No Name>. Shadow scythe slash which drains all EP you have (!).
     Uses <No Name>. Shadow scythe slash which halves Fei's HP.

   Oops! Don't worry, she's not as tough as she looks. Her regular attacks
   do 1 HP, so the only way she has to kill you is to half your HP over and
   over until you're really low, then finish you with that. The problem is
   that she'll drain all your EP at the beginning of the fight, but if you
   get that low on life you can still use an Aquasol.

   Boss:
   Rico
     HP 9999, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Green, somewhat alien-looking wrestler.
     Uses "Steel Body". Raises Defense.
     Uses "Steel fist". Raises Attack.

   After performing "Steel Body" and "Steel fist", Rico will unleash a combo
   which will hit for about 1300 damage. In other words, you can't win.

   You'll wake up again in the same building. Cue to some chatting with the
   doctor, which will tell you your rank. The rank you get is as follows.

   Beat no opponents (Leonardo beat you)     :  Rank D
   Beat one opponents (Heinrich beat you)    :  Rank C2
   Beat two opponents (Vargas beat you)      :  Rank C1
   Beat three opponents (Suzarn beat you)    :  Rank B
   Beat four opponents (Rico beat you)       :  Rank A

   Go upstairs, and you'll find you're in a sort of inn. Talk to the cook in
   front of the counter, and he'll offer you the choice to get the "Daily
   Special" or the "Dish a 'la Rank". Some of these dishes are said to have
   a beneficial effect on certain stats, but I haven't noticed any increase
   of them in the Status screen. It might be still true...

   There are two possible "Dishes a 'la Rank" for each rank, chosen randomly
   each time you re-enter the inn. They are:

   Rank D  : Thunder Gruel (?)      / Fried Grueger       
   Rank C  : Ether Omega (Ether)    / Stamina Uppen (Stamina)
   Rank B  : Heavyweighter (?)      / Nortuna Fish (Wisdom)
   Rank A  : Boosta Limit (Agility) / Battlin Steak      
   Rank S  : Choose any of the above

   The "Daily Special" is choosen randomly from the following.

   Mightymite (Defense and Ether Defense)
   Baste Grand

   In any case, head to the door in to the West. You'll be in a street.
   As a bystander will tell you later, there are quite some signs in the
   walls that you can read.

   To the northest there's nothing but the alley you endured your "Baptism"
   in (furthermore, the signs in its wall can't be read, for some reason).
   The house just in front of the restaurant has some people you can talk
   to, but nothing more (talk to the little girl twice ^_^).

   You can climb the ladder to the roofs. There you can go northwest to the
   entrance to the sewers (a sewer entrance in a roof?), but you'll go there
   later anyway. There's also a dog who will bark anytime you get near it,
   and a guard that will offer to sell you some dog food for 5 G, provided
   you made the dog bark before. You can then give it to the dog. I don't
   have a clue if this serves any purpose, though. There's not much else you
   can do in the roofs, even if you climb the ducts.

   To the South there's a Nisan facility that seems to give shelter to some
   refugees. You can climb the ladder in the second floor to reach the
   building's roof, but as before, there's not much to do.

   Continue to the East and you'll find a bar. Upon entering here, you will
   meet Hammer, a camel-like looking guy. He'll introduce himself (the
   dialogue here is COMPLETELLY different depending on which Rank you got;
   in some cases Fei will sound more aggresive than in others and in one
   case he almost sounds like he's apologizing instead). He'll also offer
   to sell you some items and accesories.

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Rosesol                 100
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150
 
   Character Equipment:
   Metal Jacket            550
   Metal Helmet            200
   Poison Guard           1500
   Sleep Guard            1500
   Brain Guard            1500
   Guardian Ring          2000

   The character items aren't too hot, but the equipment is mostly new. Get
   a Metal Helmet for Fei, and if you didn't beat Suzarn, you'll need a
   Metal Jacket too. Now exit the bar and go North to reach the two last
   houses of this sector.

   The one to the East is an Ethos facility in which you can sell any
   Hob-Jerky, Fang, Eyeball or Scales you might have. Their buying prices
   differ depending on your Rank: check the "Selling Prices" section for
   details.

   The one to the West is actually the inn-like thing you awakened in, so
   don't bother. Instead, go northeast and the guard will tell you that the
   Imperial Battling Comittee is looking for you.

   Go back to the bar and a scene will take place. Then go back to the inn
   and another scene will follow. When Citan asks you what to do now, you
   can tell him you want to rest before and you'll be able to move around
   (and save). After that, talk to Hammer to bring up the same three
   choices. You can safely tell him to deactivate the collar, don't worry.
   Or you can tell him to forget about it (but I reccomend you tell him to
   try it). However, Kelvin Valters (kelv10@yahoo.com) has come up with 
   a rather more lucrative solution...

I have discovered a way to make good money in Kislev. I found it out when 
talking to Hammer and Citan about the collar removal. On the other two 
occasions I played the game, I simply answered "yes" and got Fei's weird 
"premonition" sort of thing. However, on this third occasion, I chose to 
rest. When I awoke, I saved, then asked Citan to remove my collar. He 
actually manages to dislodge part of it, and you can then sell it to Hammer 
for a cool 5000G (quite a lot at this stage of the game)!

   Either way, some more scenes will happen, then you'll be in the basement
   of the inn.

   Oddly enough, though you are registered as a battler, the monster parts
   exchange rates at the Ethos facility will be the same as before. Oh well.
   Head to the exit of the D block (to the northeast from the Ethos
   facility), and the guard will finally let you pass.


                         N o r t u n e

   At last, you're in Nortune's map. Unfortunatelly, the only areas you have
   access to as a prisoner are the D block and the C block, where the
   Battling is. So go there.


        =====================================================
        E P I S O D E   1 8   :   B r a v e   B a t t l e r s
        =====================================================


        N o r t u n e   C   B l o c k   ( B a t t l i n g )

   You'll be greeted by Rue Coen again as you enter. After that, you can
   talk to the clerk nearest to the exit to get a detailed explanation about
   the Battling, controls, etc. Inside the other room, you can save in the
   Memory Cube, and talk to Hammer to buy items and Gear parts. The items
   are the same as before (he doesn't sell character equipment now); as for
   the Gear parts... he'll say you've not been assigned a Gear yet (very
   true, but then why did he offer them? ^_^;). Talk to Rue then and tell
   her you're ready.

   She'll show you your Gear. It's the Weltall! (it looks cool from this
   angle). You'll be given four choices: get an explanation of controls
   (it's the same as when you talked to the clerk before); engage a
   Tutorial Mode (you should do this the first time around); enter Practice
   Mode (also reccomended), or begin battle.

   First Battle : Ganador

   It doesn't matter whether you win or lose this match, since before you
   end it, the Weltall will overheat and you'll lose.


        =================================================
        E P I S O D E   1 9   :   S e w e r   H o r r o r
        =================================================


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   The next day, you'll be in the inn's bed again. You can talk to Citan and
   Hammer; the latter will tell you how this running around (from the
   Battling to here) is killing him. You can buy items and accesories from
   Hammer as before.


        N o r t u n e   C   B l o c k   ( B a t t l i n g )

   Go to the Battling, and Hammer will already be there waiting from you
   (now you understand what he meant ^_^). You can finally buy Gear parts
   from Hammer.

   Gear Engine:
   V10-2000               2000
   V12-2000               2600

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-03600             2200
   WELT-04300             2200

   Gear Armor:
   MS 12                  2500
   MS 15                  3500

   Gear Parts:
   Extra Ar +1              50
   Extra Ar +2              75

   At last new stuff! Upgrade the Engine, Frame and Armor (as always, the
   Engine first), then replenish HP and Fuel. Now that you're at it, equip
   the Extra Ar +3 you got from beating Dora. I'm not sure whether all this
   equipment affect your stats at the battling or not, but it won't hurt,
   will it?

   Talk to the clerk to the left of the one who told you the rules of
   Battling, and she'll tell you that your scheduled opponents, Leonardo and
   Heinrich, won't be able to fight against you (technical problems? That's
   quite a funny way to put it ^_^;). Anyhow, tell her you're ready to enter
   the Battling.

   Second Battle : Tin Robo               Price money :  300 + 100 / 200 G

   Keep the pressure on him. He's quite slow, so if you attack contunuously,
   you'll interrupt his attacks most of the times. When he gets away, nail
   him with three Ether Bullets and pursue him (he should be down). Also
   remember to throw an Ether Bullet whenever you know him down (neither the
   S,S,S nor the X,X,X chains do that, so be sure to mix attacks up in
   strings). It's a rather easy battle actually. Besides, if you lose,
   you'll just have to fight him again (this is true for all upcoming
   battles), so it's no big deal. Check the Battling section for more
   detailed information and strategies.

   You'll receive 300 G as price money when you beat him, and a bonus money
   of 100 G. Unless, that is, if you do really well (beat him quickly and
   without losing too many HP), in which case you'll get 200 G as bonus
   money.

   Third Battle : Titan                   Price money :  500 + 200 / 300 G

   Not hard either. Titan is faster and smarter, but you shouldn't have much
   trouble defeating him.

   You'll get a total of 700 G for beating him. This is the last match of
   the day, so go back to D Block.


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   Go back to the inn. Citan won't talk much to you because you are supposed
   to be unrelated. So rest in the bed.
   The next day, head back to the Battling.


        N o r t u n e   C   B l o c k   ( B a t t l i n g )

   As usual, talk to the clerk and enter the match.

   Fourth Battle : W.Shaver               Price money :  750 + 200 / 300 G

   This guy excels at long range attacks (most of his regular combos shoot
   lasers).  However, in close range he's a dummy, so take it up close and
   personal!

   Fifth Battle : Musha                   Price money : 1000 + 300 / 400 G

   Hey, remember this guy from Lahan village? Anyhow, just keep attacking
   up close. The S,S,S, though it doesn't knock down, worked pretty well for
   me.

   After this match, go back to D Block and rest.


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   The next morning, Rico will appear and tell you about a series of
   murders. He, Citan and you will then head to the sewers in order to
   investigate them. When you go upstairs, you'll find that Rico is now in
   your party.

   Rico's initial equipment: Metal Vest, Power Ring S, Speed Ring.

   I'd reccomend putting that Power Ring S on Fei and having Rico get a
   Metal Helmet and Jacket from Hammer instead. Also, Citan is still
   equipped with Leather stuff, so get him full Metal gear too (heh).
   However, leave the Speed Ring on Rico: he's slow as a turtle. Or you can
   put Citan's Glasses on Rico since he misses quite a lot, but try not to
   think how Rico would look with Citan's Glasses ^_^;

   Head to the sewer entrance. If you don't remember where it was, you have
   to exit the inn via it's West door, climb the ladder, go North and then
   West, then enter the manhole.


                  N o r t u n e   S e w e r s   B 1

   Items in this area: Aquasol S, Physisol, Kislev Map.

   Enemies in this area:
   Armor Wasp
     HP 77, Exp 880, G 0. Leaves Zetasol, Eyeball.
     Character-sized. Winged river crab-like insect.
     Uses <No Name>. Lowers Attack.
     Uses "Raid". Insect swarm attacks for physical damage.
     Uses "The Swarm". Insect swarm attacks for physical damage.
   Hobgob <gray>
     HP 90, Exp 980, G 0. Leaves Hob-Jerky, Hob-Meat.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Hobgob <brown>. Potato-like
     thing ^_^;
     Uses "Gobble-gobble/HP Absorb". Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one
     fifth of a character's maximum HP.
   Acid Frog
     HP 120 (of a maximum of 150), Exp 885, G 0. Leaves Mentsol, Physisol.
     Character-sized. Short, bipedal, toad-like green thing with blue back
     fins.
     Uses <No Name>. Poisons one character.
     Uses "Rain call/Water Atk on All". Water-elemental attack on all
     characters and enemies; however, Acid Frog has the element of Water
     so this will actually cure it.
     Uses "Friends appear!". Generates another Acid Frog. When beaten, this
     one counts too for the amount of Exp and items received.

   From the ladder, go North across the walkway, then East (you'll have to
   go North a bit to cross a walkway, then South) until you find the chest
   containing an Aquasol S. Go back but don't cross the walkway to the West;
   instead, go North and Rico will show you one of the murder spots.

   Go all the way back to the exit, then West (jump over the water flow or
   you'll receive 3 damage). Head South (don't cross the walkway) and then
   southeast to get a Physisol. Go back Northeast, then cross the walkway
   leading West. Go South to reach another murder spot

   From here, go back and keep going North, nortwest and North again across
   yet another walkway. Grab the Kislev Map from the chest (it's a map of
   the sewers; it can be activated pressing Select and it will show a map
   of the current floor). After that, it's back across the walkway, and West
   this time to reach a ladder leading to B2.


                  N o r t u n e   S e w e r s   B 2

   Items in this area: Cool Shades, Knight Helm, Sewer Keys, Poison Guard,
   Gallant Belt, Gold Nugget, Zetasol DX, Mentsol, Bell Amulet, Ether
   Veiler.

   Enemies in this area:
   Rotten Sod
     HP 650, Exp 5480, G 146. Leaves Zetasol.
     Character-sized. Huge, embryo-like mutant.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Sleep" on one character.
     Uses "Counter Atk on Deathblow". Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one
     fifth of a character's maximum HP. Rotten Sod will use this each time
     it is hit with a Deathblow.
   Mullet
     HP 416 (of a maximum of 616), Exp 2928, G 0. Leaves Aquasol.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Sand Shark. Fish-like yellow
     creature.
     Uses "Can't attack while in water!". Does nothing, but you can't attack
     it when it's in water either.
   Batrat
     HP 150, Exp 1800, G 0. Leaves Fang.

     Uses <No Name>. Causes "confusion".
   Armor Wasp
   Hobgob <gray>
   Acid Frog

   There are many ways to get all items in this section due to the map not
   being linear at all and providing multiple connections between places.
   The path I'll follow isn't the only one nor, very likely, the shortest
   one neither, but it will have to do.

   Go South, then East and get the Cool Shades from the chest. Cross the
   walkway, hop over the "No entry" sign and climb the ladder (jump up when
   you're at the highest point). This will lead you to another section
   within the same floor (though it has a separate map). If you want to save
   there's a Memory Cube to the East, then South. However, you actually have
   to go North, cross the door (you'll be back in the first section), go
   West and then South, and grab the Knight Helm (equip it on Fei, who has
   the lowest HP and Defense).

   Go all the way back North, East, across the door (second section), then
   South and go down the ladder (first section again), cross the walkway and
   go West, then North (you should be near the stair you came down from B1).
   Cross the walkway, and follow the wall to the North, West, then South
   without crossing any walkway. You should see another Memory Cube now:
   save, then go North, and round the corner you should find a Rat Sweeper
   robot. Rico will comment on it automatically when you touch it; after
   that, press Cross again over it, and you'll obtain the Sewer Keys.

   Go all the way back South, across the walkway to the East and North,
   East, then across the walkway to the northeast. Go West and get the
   Poison Guard, and then go back East and further East along the wall until
   you reach a door leading southeast. This will lead you again to the
   second section of the floor.

   Go East, cross the walkway leading East and then go North and get the
   Gallant Belt. Go back South, then further South until you come across
   with Gramps (have you noticed it has the same graphic than the old men at
   Lahan, only squatted and green?). From here, go northeast quite a long
   way until you reach a chest with a Gold Nugget.

   Go back southwest to where Gramps is, then South across the walkway,
   West and South to get a Zetasol DX. Go back North then East, and take the
   walkway leading northeast. Go South to get the Mentsol, and then go North
   following the wall until you find a door in it, then cross it (pant,
   pant).

   You'll be in a room with a very tall ceiling and pipes all around. Get
   the Bell Amulet from the chest, and your party members will tell you to
   use it to lure the monster. You can also climb up the pipes to get an
   Ether Veiler (it's not easy, but rotate the camera each time so that it's
   perpendicular to the line between you and your objective).

   Now exit that room. You now have to head for the only slimy pipe that is
   not near a murder scene, because the monster never commits two murders
   in the same place. So go South, cross the walkway to the southwest, cross
   another one to the North and keep going North until you come across with
   a slimy pipe. Press the Cross button in front of it and you will summon
   the monster.

   Boss:
   Redrum
     HP 4242, Exp 52424, G 500.
     Character-sized. Scary, bony mutant with a huge bone claw.
     Uses "Gel/confusion". Causes "Confusion" on targets.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Poison" on targets.
     Uses "Bloody Rain/Fire on all". Fire-elemental attack on all
     characters and enemies; however, Redrum has the element of Fire
     so this will actually cure it.
     Uses "Murder/steal all HP". Kills a character by draining all of
     his/her HP.

   Redrum? "The Shining", anyone? In any case, this is a somewhat hard
   battle. However, there are quite a lot of things you can do to make it
   easier. Use "Iron Valor" with Fei and "Steel Fist" with Rico to raise
   their attack power (you might want to use "Steel Body" too to increase
   Rico's Defense).

   However, is your use of Citan's abilities what will make the difference.
   Use "Renki" the first turn. Then, if you have "Suiseii", use it; it will
   affect all party members because of "Renki", raising their defense
   against Fire, so that "Bloody Rain" isn't that much of a problem.
   Furthermore, if someone was equipped with the Ether Veiler you got at the
   top of the pipes, his elemental defense will be doubled.

   Even if you don't have "Suiseii", use "Renki" the first turn, so that if
   you are low in life, Citan can use "Sazanami" on all party members in
   just one turn. What some people don't realize is that "Renki" is in
   effect until you cast an Ether; it doesn't wear down as time passes or if
   you attack. Of course, once you use "Sazanami", use "Renki" again to be
   ready for the next time.

   So that's it: attack with the powered-up Fei and Rico, while Citan is in
   charge of healing, attacking too in any spare turn.
   When Redrum uses "Murder", time your other two characters so that one
   will use a Zetasol on him and the other will heal him (Citan with a
   "Renki"'ed "Sazanami" would be best) before Redrum can attack in between.

   Generally speaking, it's a good strategy to always have Citan "Renki"'ed,
   and use Fei when you want to heal just one person. If you forget whether
   if Citan had cast "Renki" or not, you can select any Ether and see if it
   would affect everyone.

   When you beat Redrum, there'll be a sequence, then you'll be in Nortune
   D Block again.

        E P I S O D E   2 0   :   B a t t l i n g   C h a m p
        =====================================================


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   Go to the inn, and Rico will be there waiting for you. The next morning,
   head for the Battling and talk to the clerk to fight.


        N o r t u n e   C   B l o c k   ( B a t t l i n g )

   Sixth Battle : Hatamoto                Price money : 1500 + 400 / 500 G

   Quite harder than the others, and there's no simple strategy you can
   follow to defeat him, because this guy doesn't have any obvious weakness.
   Just mix attacks up and beware of a four-hit combo he has in which the
   fourth hit is an Ether Bullet. He blocks quite often, so beware of combos
   that leave you open to attack.

   Seventh Battle : Firewheel             Price money : 2000 + 500 / 600 G

   Quite a lot easier. This guy hardly blocks at all, so just pummel him.
   His attacks are powerful and have quite long range (for melee attacks),
   though. He also runs around a lot so take advantage of those moments to
   nail him with Ether Bullets. Try not to attack him when he's getting up
   because he's able to recover and attack rather fast, and he has higher
   priority than you. This guy looks rather cool IMHO.

   Eighth Battle : Silver Star           Price money : 2500 + 800 / 1000 G

   His attacks are fast and have long reach, but do little damage and have
   low priority, so get as close to him as possible and pummel him. This
   guy also looks good, with some nifty metallic effects.

   After this battle, Hammer will congratulate you. After some talk, he'll
   tell you to save (in a very subtle way ^_^;); do so. Exit the Battling
   to fetch Citan.

   After the sequence, Wiseman will fight you.

   Wiseman
     HP 888, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Ominous-looking man with blue cape and hood, and a
     white mask.
     Uses "What a wimp!". Physical attack for about 90 damage. Wiseman will
     counterattack with this everytime you use a Skill and miss, in addition
     to his regular attack.

   You can win this time, but it doesn't matter whether you do so or lose:
   in any case, he'll use a technique very similar to "Raijin" and the fight
   will end.

   After that, he will finally proceed to tell you about Fei's past (at
   last!).

   The next morning, you'll be in the inn again. Head for the Battling and
   talk to the clerk again.

   Ninth Battle : Stier

   OK, this is the real thing! He's tougher than everyone you've fought
   before, but it's not that difficult either. Also, this match will have
   five rounds instead of three. Remember to run around him and don't engage
   him face-on: he's stronger than you. Use Ether Bullets and attack him
   from the sides or back. Also, when he attacks, back dash, wait for him
   to finish the string and hit him before he can recover. If he's low on
   life and you are high, use Ether Bullets to finish him off even if they
   damage you. Try to interrupt his Ether Bullets with yours. Don't worry
   about losing either: he'll just scold you and you'll be able to try
   again.

   After you beat him, there'll be a sequence, and you'll be in the
   Champion's Room (which is now yours).

        E P I S O D E   2 1   :   G e a r   D o c k   R a i d
        =====================================================


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   The door here leads to a bedroom in which you can rest and save. You have
   rank S now, which means you can eat any "Dish a la Rank" you want, and
   sell monster remains at the highest price in the Ethos facility. Since
   you don't have any bomb around your neck now, you can also explore all
   of Nortune's blocks, or exit to the World Map. However, it's of no use to
   do so at this time, except to level up. For details about the enemies you
   might find in the World Map, check Episode 23.


           N o r t u n e   C e n t r a l   D i s t r i c t

   Items in this area: Insulated Ar, Power Magic, Momento Chain, Knight
   Mail.

   Upon talking to the soldiers at the door, they will let you pass.
   The room to the West contains a model of the Goliath, a huge plane.
   Take the East door and go down the stairs to reach a hallway filled with
   hens ^_^;. The door to the South leads to the home of the family of one
   of the Kislev soldiers that died in Lahan. 
   Go through the large door leading West, and you'll be in a storeroom.
   Jump up to a box, then to the shelves which have a chest and get the
   Insulated Ar. The other chest in this room will be a lot harder to get.
   You have to activate a switch, and the crane will move. Well, you have
   to move the crane left and right so that it doesn't collide with any
   object, then make it hit the side of the crates that prevent you from
   accessing the chest. The idea is to use the crane as a stepping stone to
   jump over the crates. Funnily enough, the crane can't be used as a
   stepping stone unless you make it hit the crates, most likely to prevent
   you from cheating. In any case, all your efforts will grant you a Power
   Magic, a part that adds 8 to a Gear's Ether Power.

   When you're done, go back all the way, up the stairs, and take the
   elevator to the North.

   In this new floor, the door to the South leads to a command room filled
   with soldiers. You can't enter the door to the East, so cross the one due
   West. There, talk to the Kaiser and a sequence will take place. 

   After it is over, you'll be controlling Rico. According to Mr TaMe 
   (MrTaMe@aol.com), this is the first time you'll be able to check Rico's
   Gear equipment, so here it goes:

   Stier's initial equipment: Extra Ar +3, Def Circuit, Frame HP50.
   Engine : W13-1700. Frame: STIE-05800. Armor: Z Alloy20/5.

   I'd reccomend substituting Stier's Extra Ar +3 for a Resp Circuit; it
   misses quite a lot (like its owner), and its Def Circuit for one of the
   Beam Coats you should have.

   After that, check the mirror here for the Momento Chain. Equip it on Rico
   right now, because only him can equip it. Exit the room and another
   sequence will take place. After that, go back to the Kaiser's room and
   open the chest there; it contains a Knight Mail. Equip it on Fei or
   Citan. Apparently, there's another thing I left out in this room but was
   kindly sent in by d. Page (d@prometheus.frii.com) and Ion Ioner 
   (ionero0@yahoo.com). Quoting d. Page:

You can use the item on the Kaiser's desk in the corner of his room for a 
minigame.
The Metronome Piggybank:
The hand of the metronome will sweep back and forth in a steady motion.  You 
must press the X button to make it stop in the *exact* middle (pointing 
straight up) for some G.  The more times you get it in a row, the more G you 
get.  I only had the patience to get 4 in a row, and the prizes I received 
were:
1:      1G
2:      1G
3:      10G
4:      1G

    At last, someone has had the patience of checking this out thoroughly.
    Thanks in this case are due to Daniel Polcari (magus@cyberverse.com),
    whom I will quote:

I spent a little time using the metronome in the Kaiser's office and managed 
(after much annoyance) to get a run of 21 hits. Believe me, it is not worth 
the time. The prizes are all 1G, except..
3 Hits:  10G
5 Hits:  100G
10 Hits: 500G
20 Hits: 1000G

Although the timing never changes, so it does not become
"more difficult."

   When you're done, leave this room.  Citan will comment that Hammer should 
   have his information ready, so you'll be off to a bar in Nortune's A 
   Block automatically.


                   N o r t u n e   A   B l o c k

   After the sequence, you'll be on top of a building. You can either enter
   the door to exit to the street, or, more spectacularly, drop down (these
   guys give cats a run for their money). But what you should actually do
   is to drop down that barrel-like chimney that will lead to a house's
   toilet. In that house, you can have quite a lenghty conversation with the
   doctor from D block. Among others, she'll tell you how to knock at the
   door in order to get here later.

   This block is new for you so explore and talk to people, as usual.
   In front of an alley you will find, of all people, Big Joe (how did he
   manage to get here?). He'll offer to allow you to pass and see something
   interesting if you pay him 5000 G. If you do so, however, he'll run away
   telling you how he swindled you. Do pay him, though, because later on,
   you'll be able to get an M Disk if you did this before. Thanks yet again
   to Stuart Logan (Sturat@webtv.net) for this.

   There's also an item shop around here.

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Rosesol                 100
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   Not to mention an accesory shop.

   Character Equipment:
   Metal Jacket            550
   Metal Helmet            200
   Poison Guard           1500
   Sleep Guard            1500
   Brain Guard            1500
   Guardian Ring          2000

   All this is the same stuff that Hammer sold, though.
   There's nothing else left to do here, so head back to Block D.


                   N o r t u n e   D   B l o c k

   After walking around a bit, a group of battlers will talk to you. You'll
   then follow them to the Champ's room again. They will explain the
   situation and so you'll change your strategy a little. Before leaving, a
   battler will give you 2000 G. Once the plan is set up, you should save
   and rest in the bed.

   You'll wake up at night. Go up the ladder that lead to the buildings'
   rooftops (you still remember it, don't you?). Go up to the observation
   tower and talk to the blue-haired amazoness. You'll be able to hear the
   train coming. When it's below you, jump on it (yes, from the observation
   tower).

   But you're not over with railway problems! The train's cars will detach
   one after another, and you must jump to the train's front before they do
   so. Don't worry, if you mess up here or before, when trying to get on the
   train, you'll appear back at the roof as if nothing had happened (I think
   that the idea is that nothing DID happen, and that the programmers are
   being king enough to save you the trouble of reloading a saved game).
   After that, you'll jump to the relative safety of...


      N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S t o r a g e   R o o m   A

   Save in the Memory Cube. The door to the East is locked. Try to open the
   South door and some workers will appear. After that, you won't be able to
   cross that door either, since there's people on the other side. So climb
   the crates and pieces to reach the duct to the West


            N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   D u c t s   A

   Enemies in this area: 
   Mechanic
     HP 333, Exp 850, G 180.
     Character-sized. Brown and blue-uniformed birdman (or is it a helm?)
     with a strange-looking repair tool.
     Uses <No Name>. Heals 160 damage to any Gear on the enemy's side.
   Hobgob <gray>
   Batrat

   (Note: Hobgobs have "HP 60 (of a maximum of 90)" in this dungeon).

   Go South. At the junction, go West, and you'll find a grid you can look
   down through. There you'll see the Weltall being carried by automated
   machines.
   Go back to the junction and this time go South. Turn East when you have
   to, then go South again, East, then North through the door.


      N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S t o r a g e   R o o m   B

   Jump over to the crates to the West (if you fall down, jump from the lone
   crate to the stair of crates to the West. This lone crate can be pushed).
   Ignore the box to the South. Enter the door leading West.


            N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   D u c t s   B

   Enemies in this area:

   Batrat

   OK, here are three juctions. To exit this section you have to go West,
   then South. All of the other paths (North, then North; North, then East;
   and West, then West) lead to different grates you can look through.

   Anyhow, the Southward path curls and ends in a door leading East. Cross
   it and a sequence will take place.


   N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S e c u r i t y   O f f i c e   A

   Items in this area: Master Key, Frame HP30

   Walk to the shelf you saw the security guard leave the Master Key in, and
   grab it (whatever it is they're paying these security guys, it's too
   much). You'll also get a Frame HP30. Citan isn't exaggerating: Frame HP's
   are quite possibly the most useful Gear Accesories in the whole game, and
   you should equip it as soon as you get your Gear back. Or better yet,
   right now, because the game lets you do so. Anyhow, keep going East
   through the door.


           N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   H a l l w a y   A

   Enemies in this area:
   Swordsman
     HP 140, Exp 1692, G 89. Leaves Aquasol, Rosesol.
     Character-sized. Gray-uniformed security guard with helm and (surprise)
     a sword.
   Mechanic

   Just go East, then North.


               N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   R o o m

   Items in this area: 100 G

   Check the machine on the North wall for 100 G. Then keep going North.


            N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   H a l l w a y   B

   Enemies in this area:
   Swordsman
   Mechanic

   The door to the South can be open using the Master Key, and it leads to
   the second storeroom, the one with the piles of crates.


      N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S t o r a g e   R o o m   B

   Items in this area: Beam Coat.

   The box to the South can be opened with the same key too, and it contains
   a Beam Coat. Grab it, and exit back to the hallway. There, go North and
   West through the door.


    N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S e c u r i t y   O f f i c e   B

   Items in this area: Minigear, Evasion Ring.

   If you get the Minigear in this room (it's near some books between two
   chairs), its owner will come back and he, not being too pleased with you
   stealing his (deep breath) "Super Ultra great delicious excellent
   dynamite bomber special DX beautiful wonderful ultimately rare buy
   complete merging undefeated transforming I was going to put in a glass
   case in my home priceless Minigear", will instantly attack you (and
   he has friends).

   Battle:
   Swordsman x4
     HP 140, Exp 1269, G 175. Leaves Aquasol, Rosesol, Evasion Ring (only
     one).
     Character-sized. Gray-uniformed security guard with helm and (surprise)
     a sword.

   It's worth getting the Minigear even if only for the Evasion Ring, which
   they always leave (the other items may vary as usual). After that, go
   through the North door.


      N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   S t o r a g e   R o o m   A

   This is the room you started in. Save, then unlock the East door and
   enter it.


            N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   H a l l w a y   C

   Items in this area: Survival Tent.

   Enemies in this area:
   Swordsman
   Mechanic

   Keep going. Don't miss the Survival Tent by the stairs.


             N o r t u n e   G e a r   D o c k   H a n g a r

   There'll be a green Gear in one of the compartments: you can talk to it
   to buy Gear parts.

   Gear Engine:
   V10-2000               2000
   V12-2000               2600

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-04300             2200
   WELT-05100             4400
   VIER-04000             2900
   HEIM-05400             4600
   HEIM-06400             4900
   STIE-06900             5600

   Gear Armor:
   MS 12                  2500
   MS 15                  3500

   Gear Weapons:
   Hot RodG               4200

   Gear Parts:
   Extra Ar +1              50
   Extra Ar +2              75
   Extra Ar +3             100
   Resp Circuit           2500
   Def Circuit            2500
   Frame HP10              250

   Upgrade your Frame (don't forget to refill your HP afterwards). Your
   Engine and Armor should be as good as the best you can buy here, though.

   Buy the Hot RodG for Elly, she'll join your party later. You might want
   to buy some of Extra Ar +3 (mostly for other people's Gears): they're
   quite cheap. Also, the Resp Circuits are very nice; they add 20 to your
   Response. You should have a Magnetic Coat equipped (which adds 25), but
   getting one of these for any other Gear that joins the fun later might be
   a good idea too (early in the game, I almost always equip one Accesory
   that raises Response). Finally, replace the Extra Ar +3 you have equipped
   by one of the Beam Coats you should have (one won from Schpariel and one
   from the locked box in this dungeon), because the most powerful attacks
   you'll be receiving from now on will be Beam attacks.

   When done, head for the easternmost Gear dispenser (they're on the
   northern wall of the inner block), and press the switch until Weltall
   appears. Then approach it and press Cross button to board it. Now board
   one of the elevators on the opposite wall of the inner block.


               N o r t u n e   B a t t l i n g   A r e n a

   Hey, when they say "Arena" they really mean it! ^_^; ("arena" means
   "sand" in Spanish). Well, Fei goes to the rescue then.

   Boss: 
   Rankar R
     HP 800, Exp 946, G 0. Leaves Scales.
     Gear-sized. Same description as the Rankar Dragon. Tyrannosaur-like.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Camera Malfunction".

   Ridiculously easy. You can actually kill this guy with a single S,S
   combo (you have to charge it first, but still...). 


        ===============================================
        E P I S O D E   2 2   :   N i g h t   P u r g e
        ===============================================


                          N o r t u n e

   After the sequences you'll fight...  Not these Gebler guys again?!
   Sigh... Some people just don't give up...

   Aegisknight R
     HP 1600, Exp 5570, G 1000.
     Gear-sized. Big light blue Gear with two large shields.
     Uses "Pile Driver/Weaken Ar". Causes "Armor Damage".

   Yawn. Can't any of these guys put up a decent fight? Trample his face,
   maybe they'll stop bothering you.

   Swordknight R
     HP 1800, Exp 5570, G 1000.
     Gear-sized. Light red Gear with twin metallic whip-blades and a cannon
     for right hand.

   At last, one of them does pose a threat! Not exactly The Mighty Thing,
   but at least he'll do some damage before he's disposed of. Good thing
   you now have a Frame HP30 ^_^, use it when low on HP.

   Clawknight R
     HP 1500, Exp 5570, G 1000. Leaves Beam Coat.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a claw and a razor shield.

   Easier than the last one. He's somewhat fast though, so you might want
   to turn Booster on to get even with him (but it's not even close to
   being neccesary).

   After that, Rico will join you (even him thinks that these guys are
   worthless! ^_^;), and you'll fight...

   Wandknight R x2
     HP 1800, Exp 5570, G 500.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with a large rifle.
     Uses "Beam Gun/Beam Atk". Causes Beam damage.
     Uses "Power Beam/Beam Atk". Causes Beam damage.

   Since Rico's with you now, this should be easy. These guys' "Power Beam"
   actually does good damage (about 600), but you should be able to beat
   them before they can abuse it. Besides, if you equipped the Weltall with
   a Beam Coat, it will halve Beam damage.

   Another scene now (the dialogue is quite nice... BTW, when Fei confronts
   the Vierge, it does have HP (2400), as if it was an enemy), and you'll be
   given the chance to save, do so. You'll also have the chance to change
   your Gears' equipment. After that, press Circle to exit to the main
   action.

   After some verbal exchange with Dominia (the cheek! She IS a Lambs too!),
   you'll fight her.

   Hecht
     HP 7500, Exp 48106, G 20000. Leaves HP Drive.
     Gear-sized. Brownish-green turret-mounted Gear torso.
     Uses "Aerod/Beam Atk". Causes Beam damage (why are Dominia's Aerods
     a Beam attack instead of Ether?).
     Uses "Aerod/Beam Atk". Counterattacks any physical attack by causing
     Beam damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Creates a Super Aerod.

   Super Aerod
     HP 2000 (approx), Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Large, floating laser emitter.
     Uses "Super Aerod/Beam Atk". Autodestructs, and does about 1000 points
     of Beam damage to all party members.

   Some clarifications: Hetch appears with no Super Aerods, but will
   eventually create one as time goes on. While a Super Aerod is present,
   Hetch can't do anything, not even creating more Super Aerods or
   counterattacking. The Super Aerod will eventually use "Super Aerod/Beam
   Atk", and destroy itself in the process, thus allowing Hetch to attack
   again or create another Super Aerod. Finally, I can't know the exact
   amount of HP the Super Aerod has because they're stored as 9999 (it's a
   long story).
   This isn't a very tough boss, since you get completelly healed before
   fighting it. As usual, turn on Booster. I would actually reccomend to
   leave Super Aerods alone, since they'll prevent Hetch from attacking, and
   1000 damage isn't that much. Instead, concentrate on Hetch. The damage/
   time ratio is better with Level 1 Skills than with Level 2 ones, but it's
   your choice. Don't forget to use Fix Frame HP when you're low on HP!


                   N o r t u n e   A   B l o c k

   Items in this area: M Disk.

   Elly has joined the party again, and she's got her Gear.

   Vierge's initial equipment: Magic RodG, Lite Ar +1, Beam Jammer,
   Frame HP10.
   Engine : V15-2000. Frame: VIER-01500. Armor: MS 15.

   After some talk, take the West door to exit the house (there'll be some
   dialogue before exiting). When you're out, head to the alley where Big
   Joe swindled you (it's to the East, just next to the Wild Cat pub), and
   check the furthest wall to get an M Disk. Now head back to the Wild Cat
   pub. Here, if you check the jukebox, you'll be able to listen to the
   contents of the disk. It gives the same choices that the jukebox in
   Battling at the end of the game, but it selects a track in each category
   randomly. Also, it never selects a track you haven't listened to yet. In
   this pub, talk to the new waitress standing by the door (she looks like a
   maid) if you want to change party members. Put Rico in your party instead
   of Citan if you're an "all characters must be at same level" freak like
   me; Citan should be quite powered up by now. BTW, disregard what Rico
   says about that he'll leave once you exit the city ^_^;

   Now for Elly's equipment, go to the equipment shop in this block and buy
   a Hot Rod, Metal Jacket and Metal Helm (and equip them). As for Vierge,
   change its Magic RodG for the Hot RodG you bought in the Gear dock. I
   would also change her Beam Jammer for a Resp Circuit if you bought one
   earlier: besides being IMHO more useful than a Beam Jammer, it is lighter
   and Vierge's Agility should go up one point as a result.

   When you're finished, head for the South gate of the block. Upon arriving
   there, a quite hilarious dialogue between the guards will take place,
   then a choice will pop up. Choose to fight the guards, it's the only way
   to get out of here. However, before you start, Rico will show up and
   dispose of all the guards. Exit the block, and in Nortune's map, you can
   talk to Big Joe, who will tell you about the M Disk in the alley and the
   new waitress in the Wild Cat. After that, exit to the world Map.

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Pecking Duck
     HP 200, Exp 612, G 0.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Dive Bomber. Blue, raven-like
     bird.
     Uses "Pecking! Duck!". Flock attack for physical damage.
   Rhino
     HP 500, Exp 3360, G 0. Leaves Eyeball.
     Character-sized. Cross between a rhino and an armadillo, with a huge
     armored horn. It has a small blue bird on its back.

   Rain Frog
     HP 80 (of a maximum of 150), Exp 885, G 0. Leaves Aquasol, Aquasol S.
     Character-sized. Same description as an Acid Frog. Short, bipedal,
     toad-like yellow thing with purple back fins.
     Uses "Rain call/Water Atk on All". Water-elemental attack on all
     characters and enemies; however, Rain Frog has the element of Water
     so this will actually cure it.

   Enemies in forest areas:
   Forest Elf <type 2>
     HP 180, Exp 288, G 0. 
     Character-sized. Same description as a Forest Elf <type 1>. Blue
     humanoid.
   Dwarf
     HP 450, Exp 675, G 0.
     Character-sized. Same description as Gonzalez. Grayish-brown fat guy
     with a mace.

   Head North until you come across a river. The forest can be crossed by
   getting off of your Gears. Continue North until you reach the Goliath
   Factory.


            G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   E n t r a n c e

   Take the North path when you reach the crossroad. You'll find Hammer in
   a green Gear along the way. He'll allow you to change party members and
   to shop.

   Gear Engine:
   V10-2000               2000
   V12-2000               2600

   Gear Frame:
   WELT-04300             2200
   WELT-05100             4400
   VIER-04000             2900
   HEIM-05400             4600
   HEIM-06400             4900
   STIE-06900             5600

   Gear Armor:
   MS 12                  2500
   MS 15                  3500

   Def Circuit            2500
   Frame HP10              250

   This is the same stuff that the green Gear in the Gear dock had, but
   since you couldn't change equipment for any Gear other than Weltall,
   you should upgrade them now. Change everything that's outdated, including
   Heimdal, Vierge and Stier's frame, and Heimdal's engine and armor. Then,
   refill your fuel and proceed through the gate to the North.


       G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   S t o r a g e   A r e a   A

   As you make your way to the North you'll be succesively ambushed by
   groups of Gears.

   Battle:
   HarkebusMk10 x3
     HP 400 (of a maximum of 550), Exp 3200, G 200.
     Gear-sized. Leg-mounted vulcan turret.

   Battle:
   NeoMushaMk100 x3
     HP 360, Exp 2988, G 200.
     Gear-sized. Same description as a Musha Mk100. Somewhat old-looking war
     Gear.

   Battle:
   HarkebusMk10 x2

   Keep going North through the door.


           G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   H a l l w a y

   Items in this area: O2 Cylinder

   Enemies in this area:
   Hatamoto Mk3
     HP 640 (of a maximum of 800), Exp 5200, G 250. Leaves Mica.
     Gear-sized. Blue Gear with a spear.
   Mechanic
   HarkebusMk10
   NeoMushaMk100

   Mechanics always appear four at a time in random battles. If you have
   Elly in your party, she can cast ThermoDragon to dispose of them all at
   once.

   Keep going. When you reach the crossroad, the South path leads to a
   Memory Cube. Save and go West. At the new crossroad, the East path leads
   to a chest with an O2 cylinder. Grab it, then go West. When you reach the
   door, cross it.


       G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   S t o r a g e   A r e a   B

   As before, you'll run into a series of unavoidable battles here.

   Battle:
   HarkebusMk10 x2

   Battle:
   Hatamoto Mk3 x2
   Mechanic x4

   When you're on the other side, activate any elevator. It will lead you to
   a conveyor belt into a new area.


       G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   S t o r a g e   A r e a   C

   Items in this area: Extra Ar+3.

   Enemies in this area:
   Shinobi Mk0
     HP 960, Exp 12000, G 1500. 
     Gear-sized. Dark purple Gear with long claws and a tail.
   Hatamoto Mk3

   You can get to the chest with the Extra Ar +3 by getting off of your
   Gears. Turn the switch in the East wall on so that the conveyor belt is
   reversed, then hop onto the elevator, activate it, and walk over the
   conveyor belt again.


       G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   S t o r a g e   A r e a   D

   Enemies in this area:
   HarkebusMk10

   If you turn on the switch by the ducts, three HarkebusMk10 will pop out
   and you'll have to fight them, so don't. Instead, turn the switch by the
   upwards-leading conveyor belt to reverse it, and hop onto it. Keep
   walking until you reach the end of the conveyor belt series (don't drop
   down to the Storage Area A).


       G o l i a t h   F a c t o r y   S t o r a g e   A r e a   E

   Items in this area: Mica, Gold Nugget

   Enemies in this area:
   NeoMushaMk100

   Save in the Memory Cube, then push the switch by the ducts. This will
   cause two chests with a Mica and a Gold Nugget to appear, so get them.
   Then push the switch by the memory Cube and hop over the conveyor belt
   leading East. In the next area, advance until you meet Fis-6.

   Boss:
   Fis-6
     HP 6800 (of a maximum of 10000), Exp 67284, G 15000. Leaves Ground.
     Gear-sized. Large Gear with an axe and a shield.
     Uses "Shift Up". Raises Fis-6's Attack, Defense and Speed.
     Uses "Overheating". Lowers Fis-6's Attack, Defense and Speed to their
     original values, plus halts Fis-6 actions for a while. This will happen
     after three "Shift Up"s.
     Uses "Fis-6Mechanic". Creates a Fis-6Mechanic.

   Fis-6Mechanic
     HP 600, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Mechanic. Brown and
     blue-uniformed birdman (or is it a helm?) with a strange-looking repair
     tool.
     Uses <No Name>. Heals 500 damage to Fis-6.

   Attack him as you would with any boss, but when you notice your attacks
   don't do much damage (as a consecuence of Fis-6's "Shift Up"s), turn off
   Booster and start charging fuel until it overheats, then attack again.
   Remember that you charge fuel faster when your Attack Level is high.
   When it overheats, four Fis-6Mechanic will appear. Dispose of them to
   charge your Attack Level, then attack Fis-6.

   Once it's over, enter the Goliath, save and talk to Citan. Tell him
   you're ready.

   After a sequence, you'll fight Grahf!

   Boss:
   Grahf
     HP 5000, Exp 0, G 0.
     Character-sized. Masked, tenebrous-looking man in armor.
     Uses "Super Guided Shot". Fireball combo which halves a Gear's HP.

   You can't lose no matter what, because he won't attack Elly, and if only
   she is standing, the battle will end (same as if you had won, I think).

   Some more juicy sequences will follow now.


        =================================================
        E P I S O D E   2 4   :   E s c a p e   I g n a s
        =================================================


                D r i f t i n g   P l a t f o r m

   As Elly, head for the other side of the platform and open the trap door
   in there.


                        Y g g d r a s i l

   Now, as Citan and Rico, save, then head for the Yggdrasil's bridge and
   talk to Bart.

   After the sequences, you'll be in control of Bart. Head for the Gear
   Hangar. Head for the place assigned to Stier and you'll meet Rico. Then
   go to the Gear shop and talk to Citan. This will trigger more sequences.


        =====================================================
        E P I S O D E   2 5   :   M e n   o f   t h e   S e a

            T h a m e s   A r m o r   G r o u n d

   Items in this area: Deathblower1 [see Thames Beer Hall]

   There's a Memory Cube here, and the man under the roof in the East part
   will sell you equipment.

   Character Equipment:
   Marshal Rod            1000
   Serpent Sting          1200
   B&JM10A Ammo             20
   ShotG50 Ammo             30
   Penguin Coat           1000
   Dervish Dress          1400
   Wind Ring              5000
   Earth Ring             5000
   Fire Ring              5000
   Water Ring             5000

   Get the Serpent Sting, four Penguin Coats and a Dervish Dress. Equip Elly
   with the Dervish Dress and Fei with a Penguin Coat. It's debatable
   whether if you should get the Marshal Rod or not, since you'll get the
   Lunar Rod later, which is a bit less powerful but causes "Sleep".

   Before leaving this area, be sure to visit an item shop under a similar
   roof to the West.

   Character Items:
   Aquasol                  20
   Aquasol S               100
   Rosesol                 100
   Rosesol S               300
   Zetasol                 100
   Physisol                 10
   Mentsol                  20
   Physimentsol             50
   White Star              500
   Brown Star              500
   Red Star                500
   Blue Star               500
   Hard Star               800
   Speed Star             1000
   Igissol                2000
   Aegissol               2000
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   I'd reccomend Aquasol S and Physimentsol, assuming you already have
   plenty of Omegasol and some Zetasol. I'm not a big fan of items that cast
   spells so I wouldn't get any Star, etc... but that's up to you. 


                      T h a m e s   D e c k 

   Though it's by no means neccesary, I'd reccomend you to go to the Supply
   Entrance now.


              T h a m e s   S u p p l y   E n t r a n c e

   Items in this area: Super Goggles, SerpentGWhip, Lunar Rod, D Circuit,
   Mica.

   You can play a quite fun card game with a little guy in the Northwest
   corner of this area. Should you win, he'll give you a Super Goggles
   accesory. Right there too, you can hop onto a box and jump East over the
   fence to reach a chest with a SerpentGWhip. Now, hop onto the barrel and
   jump East again to reach the Gear shop.

   G-M686A Ammo            200
   G-GG040 Ammo            100

   Gear Parts:
   Extra Ar +4             150
   Lite Ar +1              150
   A Circuit               250
   D Circuit               250

   Frame HP30              750
   Frame HP50             1250

   You know the drill: Engines first. Brigandier should have a badly
   outdated equipment, so change that first. Also, the Gear Parts here are
   quite useful, especially Frame HP50 (you should equip one of these on
   every Gear), Lite Ar +1 (like Extra Ar +4 but sacrifices 5 Ar for 5
   Response), E Circuit (raises 4 Ether Machine and 10 Ether Armor), and
   Beam Jammer and Ground (good defense against beams and electricity,
   respectivelly).

   Walk over the large Gear rifle that's just North of the entrance. Drop
   down to the crates to the East and keep going over the Gear-sized knife.
   Jump over the drum-like things hanging from the ceiling and get the Lunar
   Rod that's over the second one. It has less attack power than the Marshal
   Rod but it causes "Sleep".

   Now enter the door that's just below the Gear rifle. Touching the West
   wall, walk South so you'll fall down to one of the crates below. Then
   walk North and get the D Circuit in the chest.

   Finally, head for the West wall of the Supply Entrance. There you should
   find a worker with a bottle in his hand. Well, hop over his head. No,
   really ^_^;. Then, when one of those drum-like things with a chest over
   it appears, jump so that you hit it with your head, sending the chest
   down. Open it to receive a Mica. Now exit the Supply Entrance and head
   for the Screw Elevator.


            T h a m e s   S c r e w   E l e v a t o r

   You must press Cross over the door as if you were trying to exit in order
   to activate the elevator. There's quite some places you can go from here.
   You don't need to use the elevator in some cases: B1 and 1F are
   connected, as are 2F and 3F, and 3F and 4F.

   B2 : Dock. Nothing to do here
   B1 : Supply Entrance. Well, you've already been here.
   1F : Deck. Same here.
   2F : Infirmary. You can rest here.
   3F : Beer Hall. See below.
   4F : Bridge. See below.

   Head to the Beer Hall.


                T h a m e s   B e e r   H a l l

   Items in this area: Mentsol, Premier Shoes.

   If you climb the ladder, cross the pipe and talk to the kid over the
   drink machine, he'll give you a Mentsol.
   You can play the card game against another person here. He'll give you a
   pair of Premier Shoes if you win. Also, beating him allows you to
   challenge the girl that's in the Armor Ground area. If you beat her too
   (easier said than done, believe me! All I can say is use pause a lot),
   she'll give you a DeathBlower1, which will allow you to use T,X Skills
   when it's equipped on a Gear. If you challenge her again and beat her,
   she'll give you an Aquasol S the second time, and a Zetasol the third.
   I didn't feel like beating her a fourth time ^_^;

   After all that, head to the Bridge and talk to the captain. Then, head
   back to the Beer Hall and talk to him again. And after the sequence, head
   back to the bridge.

   Save if you want, then go to the deck and press Cross where the Gears
   are. A boss battle will ensue.

   Boss:
   Haishao
     HP 2800, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Large, pink fish-like Gear with pincers.
     Uses "Nereid Cyclone/Water Atk". Water-elemental attack on all for
     about 1000 damage.
     Uses "Electric Arm/Elec Atk". Electricity-elemental attack on one for
     about 300 damage.

   Quite easy, having only 2800 HP. Fei alone could do the job (actually,
   he'll most likely do it because both Bart and Elly will probably have
   low levels). Just keep attacking.


                        Y g g d r a s i l

   In case you're wondering, the Gear Shop has updated its stuff. It now has
   the same parts that could be bought at Thames' Supply Entrance. 
   When you regain control over Fei and the others, head to the ladder of
   the Yggdrasil that leads outside. Continue through the Dock and more
   scenes will trigger.

   Exit the Yggdrasil via the ladder and head for Thames' Beer Hall. After
   the scene, head to the Yggdrasil's Infirmary (check the map if you're
   lost). Now go to the Engine Room. After the sequence, talk to Citan.

   Now would be a good time to upgrade and equip your Gears, because the
   battle ahead will be a bit tough. Brigandier and Vierge need most of
   their equipment changed. Equip the DeathBlower1 on Fei. Other stuff that
   could be useful includes D Circuit and O2 Cylinder (because the battles
   will be underwater), and Mica and Ground (since the most damaging attacks
   will be electric-elemental). Also equip the SerpentGWhip on Brigandier if
   you haven't done so already, and the SerpentSting and a Penguin Coat on
   Bart.

   Go to Infirmary and talk to Elly. You'll be given the chance to change
   equipment, including Elly's; do so now (you can't save, though). Then,
   you'll confront Dominia again in a new toy.

   Boss:
   Bladegash
     HP 3000, Exp 22428, G 3000. Leaves STR Drive.
     Gear-sized. Red and white Gear wielding a Sword.
     Uses "Wind Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack wind-elemental and more
     damaging.
     Uses "Fire Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack fire-elemental and more
     damaging.
     Uses "Earth Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack earth-elemental and
     more damaging.
     Uses "Water Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack water-elemental and
     more damaging.

   Quite easy, but this isn't the real thing. After this, you'll confront
   Haishao again, this time piloted by Ramsus.

   Boss:
   Haishao
     HP 4500 (of a maximum of 5000), Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Large, pink fish-like Gear with pincers.
     Uses "Electric Arm/Elec Atk". Three Electricity-elemental attacks for
     about 700 damage each.
     Uses "Mirror/predict and counter". Any physical attack on Haishao will
     miss and trigger "Counter Nereid Cyclone".
     Uses "Counter Nereid Cyclone". Water-elemental attack on all for about
     1000 damage.
   Miang's Gear
     HP 20000, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with cool-looking shoulder pads ^_^. Cannot be
     targeted by anyone.
     Uses "Restore Gear". Restores 750 HP to Haishao.

   Somewhat hard battle. Start by activating Booster and casting Wild Smile.
   From there on, have Bart attack with level 1 Skills, Fei with T,X ones
   (if you equipped the DeathBlower1) and Elly casting Anemo Burn, which
   will cause about 700 damage. Heal when needed, but keep in mind that
   speed is essential for winning this battle (since Miang will also heal
   Ramsus, as usual). BTW, don't bother about Miang's 20000 HP; as before,
   she can't be hit.

   Head to the Thames Armor Ground. Primera, Jessiah and Billy will be
   introduced. Now head to the Dock and board the Yggdrasil.


                       Y g g d r a s i l

   Talk to Sigurd in the deck. He'll tell you that Margie wants to speak
   with you: it's up to you to do it now or later. Basically, she'll let you
   change party members whenever you talk to her.
   In any case, tell Sigurd to leave Thames and you'll be in control of the
   Yggdrasil.


            W o r l d   M a p   ( A q u v y   A r e a )

   Enemies in ocean areas:
   Griffon
     HP 4000, Exp 12150, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Looks like a Griffon; you know, upper quarters of eagle,
     lower ones of lion. Go fetch the mythology dictionary for details ^_^;.
   Breaker
     HP 500, Exp 5800, G 300. Leaves Extra Ar+4.

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Ripper
     HP 1000, Exp 10440, G 0.
     Character-sized. Pink, really fat guy with white belly. Has one
     plant-like foot and tubes in its back.
     Uses "Salt". Does nothing (he's condimenting you so you'll taste
     better ^_^).
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum HP.
     Uses <No Name>. Swallows a character whole! He/she cannot be recovered
     until the end of this battle. The game is over if all characters are
     swallowed!
   Planter
     HP 300, Exp 2008, G 0. Leaves Bizfruit.
     Character-sized. Basically, a pineapple with a mouth ^_^;
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum HP.
     Uses <No Name>. Lowers Accuracy.
   Lil' Allemange
     HP 400, Exp 2207, G 0. Leaves Eyeball.
     Character-sized. A red eye with a small body and long wings and legs.
     Uses "Loving gaze". Causes "Confusion" on one character.

     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 1500 damage.
   Mammoth
     HP 2500, Exp 3750, G 0. 
     Gear-sized. Blue horned buffalo-alike.
   Wels

   The Yggdrasil II can cruise over both ocean water and sand. What's more,
   it can use beachs to pass from one of them to the other. It can't
   navigate through rivers, however. Also, while navigating over the ocean,
   you will be subject to random battles. By the way, the "enemies in ocean
   areas" listed above are all enemies that can be found in any ocean area
   of the World Map, since there's no way to separate them into different
   areas.

   There's a lot of places you can go to now. For a start, you can head to
   the beach on the southeast part of the Ignas continent (it's just below
   Dazil). From there, you can visit Dazil, Bledavik, Nisan, the Blackmoon
   Forest or Citan's house (though not Nortune). There's nothing new in any
   of these places as far as I know though (but I've not checked them
   in-depth). You can also go the the Babel Tower, the 'Ethos' Dig Site and
   a lighthouse in the largest and easthernmost of the Aquvy Islands.
   However, you won't be able to enter any of them yet.   

   This would also be a good time to level up your characters, especially
   Elly and Bart. Remember that they must fight outside their Gears to learn
   Skills.

   When you're done, head for the 'Ethos' H.Q. It's the northernmost yellow
   point of the southwest part of your map (this part is the Aquvy Islands).


                 T h e   ' E t h o s '   H . Q .

   Go North across the door in the fence. You'll meet Billy; follow him
   into the Practice Hall.


                  P r a c t i c e   H a l l

   Keep following Billy and going to where he tells you. When you reach a
   hi-tech looking facility, go East and North to meet him.
   When you've left Elly with Fei, go back to the first floor. Explore
   around a bit (be careful not to get lost, this place is quite big), then
   head for the library (it's the door just East of the stairs leading to
   the infirmary). Upon exiting, you'll meet with Elly. Now go back to the
   infirmary. After a scene, you'll appear in the Yggdrasil's infirmary. Go
   to the bridge, talk to Sigurd and head for the Orphanage. It's the dot
   that's more to the southeast in the Aquvy region; don't confuse it with
   the Babel Tower, which is the dot right southeast of the 'Ethos' H.Q.

                       O r p h a n a g e

   Items in this area: Tag Badge, Book 1, Book 2, Book 3.

   There are some things you can play around with here. Very nice the swing
   improvised with a Gear's hand ^_^.
   Talk to the eagle man in the chicken pen. He'll ask you to get all three
   chickens into the pen (um... haven't we done this in a certain N64 game
   recently? ^_^;). You have to call them (same as talking to them), then
   run in the direction you want them to go. They'll stop after a while, so
   call them again. It's quite easy and you'll receive the Tag Badge.

   Enter the house by its front door and you'll find Billy; talk to him to
   trigger a scene. Climb the ladder in this room and talk to the boy.
   Answer "OK" and he'll give you the Book 1.

   Now take the North door. In the next room, the northernmost door of the
   East wall leads to the toilet; however, it's presently occupied. Knock on
   the door: there's a random chance of that the boy in there has finished
   and gives you the Book 2. If you don't get it at first, exit the room and
   reenter it, then try again. It shouldn't take more than three of four
   tries.

   From this room, take the first door to the East. You'll find a room with
   Primera and, more importantly, the son of the person that turned into
   Redrum (remember Nortune?). If you talk to him with Rico in your party,
   you'll give him the Bell Amulet and he'll give you the Book 3. Head back
   to the last room and now go North. In this room search the bookshelf.
   Billy will pop out and a sequence will follow. Now head back out of the
   Orphanage and you'll be in the Yggdrasil.

                       Y g g d r a s i l

   Head to the gun room (the room Maison is always in). Talk to Jessie and
   then to Sigurd. After the sequence, head back to the gun room and talk to
   Billy (he's near the West end of the dinner table). He'll explain about
   his past, then Sigurd will take the Yggdrasil to the ship. You'll be
   asked to make a party of three, which must include Billy (and of course,
   Fei's still recovering).

   Billy's initial equipment: B&J M10 Gun, Holy Habit, Holy Pendant, Stamina
   Ring S, B&JM10A Ammo, EthWind Ammo, EthFire Ammo, ShotG50 Ammo.
   
   Make sure you also include Elly in your party, because the boss fight
   after this dungeon will take a lot of time otherwise. The method for
   changing Billy's equipment and specifically, the ammo for his guns, is
   a bit different from that of other characters; you might want to check
   "Billy's Equipment Screen" under "Main Menu" in section 6 of his FAQ,
   though it's quite well explained in the game itself later on. Also, note
   that Billy wears no headwear, so equip him with a Metal Helmet if you
   have it. If you don't, don't worry and read on.
   Climb the ladder that leads to the outside of the Yggdrasil.


                   T r a n s p o r t   S h i p

   Items in this area: Penguin Coat, B&JM10S Ammo, Survival Tent, Cabin Key,
   Silver Beret, ShotG60 Ammo.

   Enemies in this area: 
   Abandon
     HP 150, Exp 3203, G 525. Leaves B&JM10S Ammo.
     Character-sized. Looks like a brown UFO with a head and arms popping
     out of its upper part.
     Uses "Eth Saucer". Ether attack for about 50 damage.
   Wels

   Enter the transport ship. Once inside, head North (from now on, you'll
   bang into stacks of boxes, throwing them), and turn on the switch to the
   East. Once you reach the North wall, go West and South to get a Penguin
   Coat, then go back to the North wall. The door to the East won't open.
   The one to the North (which is what you opened with the switch), leads to
   a room with a Memory Cube and another locked door, So go back and climb
   up the ladder. Once in the ship's deck, go North and down the hatch.

   Grab the B&JM10S Ammo and equip it on Billy. Now go South evading the
   hanging... things, and get the Survival Tent. Now that you're there,
   throw the switch in the East wall. This will open a door leading to the
   room with the Memory Cube. Go back North and cross the door.

   Numbering the doors in this hallway from West to East and from South to
   North, you have to get the Cabin Key in room 2, Silver Beret in room 3
   and the ShotG60 Ammo in room 5. Equip the Silver Beret on Elly, and if
   you hadn't equipped a helmet on Billy put whatever she was wearing before
   on Billy.
   You can also activate the shower in room 1 to see a sequence.
   To open the door to the new section you must run into it five times.
   Here, none of the doors will open so it's up the ladder again. Go North,
   save in the Memory Cube if you want, then get near a spherical hatch a
   little South. It should open allowing you to jump down inside.

   Boss:
   Bloody
     HP 4242, Exp 25700, G 3000.
     Character-sized. Same description as Redrum. Scary, bony mutant with a
     huge bone claw.
     Uses "Murder/steal all HP". Kills a character by draining all of
     his/her HP.
     Uses "Bloody Rain/Fire on all". Fire-elemental attack on all
     characters and enemies; however, Redrum has the element of Fire
     so this will actually cure it.

   The trickiest part of this fight is the beginning: Bloody will use
   "Murder" three times in a row, meaning that if you don't recover the
   fallen characters, you'll lose. However, after that it's pretty easy, as
   he's a bit slow, and also because Billy's Ethers kick ass. Use Goddess
   Call on everyone to speed them up. My Citan ended up performing four
   actions for each one of Bloody's! Holy Light recovers HP for all
   characters and Goddess Eyes raises Defense. What more could you ask for?

   After the battle, open the door to the South.

   Boss:
   Giant Wels
     HP 7000, Exp 77103, G 10000. Leaves G-M686 Gun.
     Gear-sized. Huge black and orange humanoid with long hanging beard-like
     things and long arms.
     Uses <No Name>. Drains 125 Fuel.
     Uses "Enlarges when hit by Ether". Raises its Attack Power but lowers
     its Defense. Giant Wels will use this when it's hit by an Ether attack.

   Giant Wels' Defense is so high that all physical attacks will inflict
   zero damage, including Skills. You have two ways to circumvent this
   problem: first, Renmazuo's Medium Attack (triangle) is performed, like in
   it's owner's case, with Ether guns. It inflicts Ether damage and so will
   hit for about 400 damage.
   The other way (and this is why I told you to include Elly in your party)
   is by using Ether attacks. Each time you do so, apart from causing about
   1000 damage, his Defense will drop. After three or four of these, you'll
   be able to cause about the usual damage. However, its attack power will
   also rise, so you better finish it quickly. Use Elly's lowest level
   Ethers, they inflict about the same damage than the others. If you run
   out of magic, the Aerods will inflict over 2000 damage (though they cost
   Fuel).
   By the way, from now on I won't tell you to use Booster in Boss battles
   since I'll just assume you will do so.


        ===================================================
        E P I S O D E   3 2   :   B u r n i n g   S o u l s
        ===================================================


   After a sequence, you'll be in the Yggdrasil. Incidentally, this is the
   first time you can check Renmazuo's equipment, so...

   Renmazuo's initial equipment: G-M10 Gun, Lite Ar+1, B Circuit,
   Frame HP 50, G-M10A Ammo, G-GG040 Ammo.
   Engine : V18-2000. Frame: RENM-6000. Armor: XMS 25.

   You should equip that G-M686 Gun you got from the Giant Wels, but since
   you have no ammo for it, you must go to the Gear Shop to purchase it.
   Now that you're here, replace that B Circuit (which is about as useful
   as Fire 1 against Ifrit) for... anything you want, really. Buy also
   plenty of G-GG040 Ammo, and if you still have money, upgrade Renmazuo's
   Frame.

   Now go to the bridge. Talk to Sigurd to launch the Yggdrasil. You should 
   now head for the 'Ethos' H.Q., but let's do an optional part first. With 
   Billy in your party, go to the orphanage.


                       O r p h a n a g e

   Items in this area: B&J M686 Gun, B&J M686 A Ammo.
   
   Remember the back door on the East wall of the orphanage? Use it. Check 
   the bookcase and, if Billy is in your party and you have the three books,
   you will put them on the shelf, revealing a secret passageway (push the 
   bookshelf all the way North to allow yourself to enter). In the secret
   room there is a B&J M686 Gun which of course you will equip on Billy. 
   BTW, though the game doesn't say so, you'll also receive B&J M686 A Ammo
   to equip on it. The information about this secret room was provided by 
   Matthias Lambrecht (mlambrecht@handshake.de). Now go back to the 
   Yggdrasil and head for the 'Ethos' H.Q.


                 T h e   ' E t h o s '   H . Q .

   Go North, cross the fence door and take the West door to the Practice
   Hall. A battle will ensue.

   Battle:
   Assassin <clawed> x2
     HP 290, Exp 3536, G 150. 
     Character-sized. Hunched ninja-alike dressed in black, with metal
     claws. Looks like Gen-an from Samurai Shodown ^_^
     Uses "Hee-hee-hee-hee~!", "Kill you next turn!". Adopts a different
     stance to perform any "Death, death, death!" attack next turn.
     Uses "Death, death, death!". Halves a character's HP.
     Uses "Death, death, death!". Reduces a character's HP to 1.
   Assassin <priest> x2
     HP 260, Exp 3307, G 120. Leaves Aquasol.
     Character-sized. Green-clad priest with his arms in cross.
     Uses "Net". Causes "Stop".
     Uses "Net". Causes "Forget".
     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 50 damage.

   Use the same strategy as in a regular fight, i.e. mop the floor with
   their faces.


                  P r a c t i c e   H a l l

   Items in this area: Gold Nugget, Aquasol DX, Seal Ar.

   Enemies in this area:
   Assassin <clawed> 
   Assassin <priest> 
   Wels

   Go straight to the West and enter the door at the end. Go through the
   doorway that was behind the bookshelf and go down the stairs. You'll have
   to fight more of those mysterious attackers.

   Battle:
   Assassin <clawed> x2
   Assassin <priest> x2

   Once in the hi-tech corridor, ignore the doorway to the South and the
   first one to the North, and take the second one instead. Climb the stairs
   and get the Gold Nugget. Exit this room and grab the chests containing an
   Aquasol DX and a Seal Ar. Go back to the room, down the stairs and to the
   hi-tech hallway, then continue East. A scene will happen, then a battle.

   Battle:
   Assassin <clawed> x3

   Go East through the door. In the junction, take the North path. The
   middle cell holds a man you should talk to, and the East one holds Big
   Joe. Now go back to the junction and this time go East. Enter the door to
   the North and activate the elevator. Once down, cross the door and keep
   going North. Take the door to the East and a story sequence will trigger.
   Exit the room and another cool one will follow, and another battle.

   Battle:
   Assassin <clawed> x3

   Enter the door to the North to activate another story sequence.

   You'll be asked to make a party of three that must include Citan (but
   not Billy anymore). Talk to Sigurd to launch the Yggdrasil and head for
   Thames.


                      T h a m e s   D o c k

   Items in this area: LongDarkCoat.

   On the Yggdrasil's Deck you will find Big Joe. If you talk to him and
   answer "yes", you'll challenge him to that game of cards you played on
   Thames. If you win, he'll give you the LongDarkCoat and leave. The Long
   Dark Coat is an Accesory that adds 10 to Attack Power (!) and 5 to Ether
   Defense, so by all means equip it on someone.
   Head to the Bridge and talk to the Captain. He'll tell you that Stein is
   headed towards the excavation site right to the North of Thames, so go
   there. It will appear in your map as a result of this conversation.


                ' E t h o s '   D i g   S i t e

   Take the elevator down and enter the hole to the West. Avoid the Gebler
   Guard in this room; you'll enter a fight if you touch him. Also, from
   now on all Gebler Guards you encounter while in this place will trigger
   a fight just like this one if you touch them.

   Battle:
   Gebler Guard x4
     HP 160, Exp 4400, G 200. 
     Character-sized. Strange-looking guard with black round helmet and a
     red hanging costume.
     Uses "Explosive Ammo/Fire Eth". Fire-elemental attack for about 60 HP.

   Enter the door to the North leading to an elevator. When it stops, exit
   it to the South.


                           Z e b o i m   

   Items in this area: B&J M686 A Ammo, Black Snake, Panalphasol.

   Enemies in this area:
   Hammerhead
     HP 180, Exp 3708, G 200. Leaves Eyeball.
     Character-sized. Humanoid bird with a hammer-like head.
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs EP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum EP.
   Shellbelle
     HP 680, Exp 9669, G 0. 
     Character-sized. Floating shelled mollusk whose exposed base is a
     woman's face (honestly, those designers...). 
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Sleep" on all party members.
     Uses "Wake up kiss". Physical attack on a sleeping character for about
     10 damage.
     Uses "Toxic Discharge". Causes "Poison" on one character.
   Carrier
     HP 420, Exp 7488, G 0. Leaves Fang, Zetasol.
     Character-sized. Blue lizardman with long arms. Has a high Evade rate.
     Uses <No Name>. Lowers Accuracy on one character.
   Phobia
     HP 50, Exp 4096, G 2048. 
     Character-sized. Blue woman which has fins coming out of her dress.
     Phobia absorbs all damage dealt to her as HP, and is damaged by effects
     that restore HP.
     Uses "Hea...l...". Does nothing (this is to hint you about her weak
     point).
     Uses "He...al...". Same as above.
   Gebler Guard

   The doors to the North and West won't open, so take the East. Admire
   the lanscape, then continue East and climb the stairs. Open the door at
   the end and go North. Go through the East door. Continue East ignoring
   the doors to the South (they won't open), and also the North corridor
   (none of it's doors will open neither). Fight the Gebler Guard and enter
   the door to the South leading to an elevator.

   Exit the elevator once it stops, then continue North. Grab the chest with
   B&J M686 A Ammo. Fight the Guard, then continue East through the corridor
   which will keep winding clockwise as you cross a door and fight some 
   Guards. Once it's straight to the West you'll see another guard. Fight 
   him, then enter the door to the West. Get the Sleep Guard (note that is 
   very easy to activate the computer instead; don't be confused). You can't
   do anything about the computer now, nor do you need to. Go back to the 
   hallway and cross the door to the South.

   Go down the stairs and continue North. Cross the door and go West, then
   North through the door. You'll reach another winding corridor. In it's
   northwest wall there's a door leading to a chest with a Black Snake.
   Equip it on Bart: it's the same as the Serpent Sting but it lowers the
   enemy's Eth Defense. Go back to the corridor and go on. You'll meet two
   groups of Guards; fight them. Enter the room to the East, grab the
   Panalphasol and save in the Memory Cube. Now get back to the corridor
   and take the door to the North. Go down the stairs and upon pressing
   Circle on the door a message will be displayed (34599999 hours ago...
   that's about 4096 years and five months!). Select Execute.

   Now you must reset the emergency level, so go back up the stairs, exit to
   the corridor and enter the door in the northwest wall of the corridor
   (the one you got the Black Snake in). Check the computer and select
   Reset. Exit the room, but before you enter the North door, go to the room
   to the East, heal all characters and save. Now enter the North door and
   go down the stairs.

   Cross the door you couldn't open before, then check the South door after
   that. In the new room, there are two doors; one southwest and one south.
   Enter the door in the southwest wall and activate the computer, because
   when the sequence ends, you'll be in the room to the other side of the
   South door. Keep advancing South. A sequence will activate when you
   get closer to the tube in the center of the room. After the hilarious
   introduction of two of the Elements, you'll fight them.

   Boss:
   Tolone
     HP 2500, Exp 31164, G 5000. Leaves VIT Drive.
     Character-sized. White-haired girl dressed in green and yellow.
     Uses <No Name>. Wind-elemental damage on all for about 100 HP.
     Uses "Positron Beam/Wind Eth". Wind-elemental damage on one for about
     80 HP.
     Uses "Tolone "Leave it to me..."". Wind-elemental damage on all for
     about 100 damage. Tolone will use this if Seraphita is beaten.
   Seraphita
     HP 2000, Exp 31164, G 5000. Leaves ETH Drive.
     Character-sized. Pink-haired girl dressed in white and red.
     Uses <No Name>. Fire-elemental damage on all for about 200 damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Fire-elemental damage on one for about 150 damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs EP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum EP.
     Uses "Seraphita "I'll get you."". Fire-elemental damage on all for
     about 300 damage. Seraphita will use this if Tolone is beaten.

   First of all, beat Seraphita as soon as possible! She is the most
   powerful of the two, and has less HP. I would reccomend that you used
   Suiseii on all party members to lessen the damage done, but even so her
   hitting-all Ether will cause 70 damage. Now that Seraphita is beaten,
   Tolone will become a bit harder, but it will be still much easier than
   when Seraphita was around. Finish her off.

   Go all the way back to the exit of the dungeon, but on your way out,
   remember to heal and save in the Memory Cube that's after the corridor
   with the fake doors, because this is not the end yet. After you encounter
   Stein in the bridge, you'll face Id!

   Boss:
   Id
     HP 3000, Exp 90534, G 5. 
     Character-sized. Pale-faced young man with red long hair in a black and
     red hi-tech looking armor.
     Uses <No Name>. Ether attack on all for about 50 damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Double Skill attack for variable damage (depending on
     Skills used).

   Hard! Well, he's Id, what do you expect? Heal a lot and don't let anyone
   fall below 180 HP without healing them. Id is almost fast enough to
   attack once for each action you perform even though there's three of you!
   Fortunatelly he doesn't have that much HP. Have Citan always "Renki'ed"
   and use every powering-up Ether of the other characters. Billy should
   help things if he's in your party, but I beat Id without him.

   When it's over, go back East through the hole and take the elevator to
   the exit.


                        Y g g d r a s i l

   Go inside, then head for the Gear hangar. Go to where the Weltall is
   kept. After the sequence, you must make a party of three which must
   include Billy but not Fei or Citan. Then, you'll fight Stein at last.
   But...

   Boss:
   Alkanshel
     HP 9999, Exp 0, G 0. 
     Gear-sized. Huge floating Gear with a round base instead of legs.
     Uses "Damage nullified". All attacks will inflict zero damage, and
     this message will be displayed.
     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 1300 damage.

   You can't hurt him, but after a few rounds the battle will end. A
   sequence will take place, then the real battle will begin.
     
   Boss:
   Alkanshel
     HP 13000, Exp 132549, G 30000. Leaves E Circuit.
     Gear-sized. Huge floating Gear with a round base instead of legs.
     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 1300 damage.
     Uses "Mass Limit/HP halved". Halves all party member Gears' HP.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Power Loss".
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Slow".

   After the sequences, you'll be asked to form a party which must include
   Fei. Do as Sigurd says and check the Gear shop, because they've updated
   their stuff.

   Frame HP30              750
   Frame HP50             1250

   There's so much in here that you won't know where to start. However,
   engines should be your priority, as well as weapons (that should be
   cheap). If there's somebody to equip with a Frame HP 50 buy it now,
   because it's a part that won't grow old, since a Frame HP is always a
   must and one higher than 50 may be a waste of fuel.
   I would reccomend that you upgraded everything for the Gears of the
   people in your party, because the next dungeon will be quite hard. It's
   important that you equip the Z Alloy 30/10 on everyone, because the
   enemies in it have a lot of Ether attacks. For the same reason,
   E Circuits are quite useful too.

   Once you're done, talk to Sigurd and dock the Yggdrasil in the Babel
   Tower. It can be seen right to the East of the 'Ethos' Dig Site.


                       B a b e l   T o w e r

   Items in this area: Ether Ar, Lite Ar +1, EarthVeil Ar.

   Enemies in this area:
   Traffic Jam <sphere>
     HP 345, Exp 6000, G 350. 
     Gear-sized. Small white and green ball with a square flat shield/signal
     on its front part.
     Uses "Alarm Beam/Eth Atk". Ether attack for about 600 damage.

   Enter the tower itself. Once you're overwhelmed enough by the size of
   this place (not to mention its background music), head Southeast, then
   East and drop down the ledge below. Enter the hollow in the platform
   and take the Ether Ar in the ledge to the South. Equip the Ether Ar in
   the place of anyone's E Circuit. Jump to the platform to the South, South
   again, then West. Keep going West until you touch the wall, then go North
   to get the Lite Ar +1.

   By the way, should you fall down during this first section of the Babel
   Tower, you'll be carried by the water to a point North of here. Just go a
   bit South climbing some platforms until you reach here.

   Anyway, now go back South, then East but midway to the other side, drop
   down to the ledge with a chest. It contains a chest with an EarthVeil Ar.
   Go West under the other platform (you won't see your Gears for a moment)
   and jump back up.

   Go back East and continue South. You'll reach the end of the ledge, but
   you'll see a hanging rope. Yes, I'm afraid so ^_^; Align yourself with
   the rope, then jump to grab it. If you manage to do it, hold left or
   right to increase the rope's swing (you can hold any direction
   continuously; you don't have to switch or anything like that). You'll
   know the rope is at it's maximum swing when it almost touches the bar
   it's hanging from. When it is so, and you're furthest to the South,
   jump straight South.

   You'll land over some sort of hyper-huge mechanical pincer (remember
   you're in your Gears!). Beware that it's upper part will bend if you step
   over it, making you fall. To reach the next platform, the best way is to
   step once over it, go back while it bends down and then step over it
   again as it comes up, so that you have that extra time while it comes to
   its original position to run Northwest over it and jump to the platform
   to the West. To reach the upper platform, jump back to the pincer and
   immediatelly back to the West before it bends. Get the ThunderRodG and
   go back to the lower platform.

   Go inside the hollow platform and then North. Fei will comment about the
   relay system. Just jump up to grab the rope that will lead you to the
   next section.


            B a b e l   T o w e r   R e l a y   S t a t i o n

   Items in this area: Gold Nugget.

   Enemies in this area:
   Conjurer
     HP 880, Exp 7500, G 550. 
     Gear-sized. White Gear with yellow highlights. Has pincers instead of
     hands.
     Uses "Eth Atk on everyone". Ether attack on all party members and
     enemies for about 300 damage on you and 800 damage on them.
     Uses "Conjure/Eth Atk". Ether attack on one for about 400 damage.

   Save in the Memory Cube. Head West, then Fei will comment about the relay
   station and you'll come out of your Gears. Enter the small door to the
   North. Get the chest with a Gold Nugget and look at the map on the North
   wall. Then, jump over the computer on the East one and activate the small
   fuse-box like thing over it (the computer itself does nothing). After a
   sequence, exit the room (you must jump to open the door). Get back on
   your Gears, then drop down West and go North up the crates to enter the
   lift.


             B a b e l   T o w e r   R e l a y   L i f t

   Items in this area: Beam Jammer, Ether Ar.

   Enemies in this area:
   Conjurer

   Jump up more crates to the East then to the platform on the West. Grab
   the chests which contain a Beam Jammer and an Ether Ar and replace any
   E Circuit for the last one. Now head for any of the two tiny ladders on
   the sides of the room. You must get out of your Gears and climb one of
   them, but you must do so by it's outside face (so that you end up walking
   over the horizontal part of the ladders when you arrive up there). Then,
   go to the center and check the shaft which emanates light to the East.


             B a b e l   T o w e r   C o n t r o  l   R o o m

   Items in this area: Old Circuit, Gold Nugget.

   Grab the chests in here (they contain an Old Circuit and a Gold Nugget).
   Jump up the large seats, then onto the southernmost small one, and check
   the computer behind it. After a sequence, you'll fight Ramsus and Miang
   yet again.

   Boss:
   Wyvern
     HP 5000 (of a maximum of 8000), Exp 23652, G 3000.
     Gear-sized. Winged golden Gear with a sword. It's on the cover of the
     instruction booklet ^_^.
     Uses "Megaflare/Eth Attack". Ether attack on one for about 600 damage.
     miss and trigger "Counter Nereid Cyclone".
     Uses "Mirror Stance/predict atk". Ramsus will adopt a defensive stance.
     All physical attacks will miss while he's in that stance. Additionally,
     he'll counterattack for about 900 HP of damage if he's attacked.
   Miang's Gear
     HP 20000, Exp 0, G 0.
     Gear-sized. White Gear with cool-looking shoulder pads ^_^. Cannot be
     targeted by anyone.
     Uses "Restore Gear". Restores 1200 HP to Wyvern.

   Quite easy. Miang takes it easy restoring him, so you'll beat him quite
   quickly. However, try to defeat him before he enters his Mirror Stance or
   the fight will take quite longer.

   After the fight, save, then take the East door that's most to the South.


           B a b e l   T o w e r   U p p e r   F l o o r s

   Items in this area: Ground.

   Enemies in this area:
   Gun Drone
     HP 400, Exp 19000, G 700. Leaves Lite Ar +1.
     Gear-sized. Ship whose body looks like that of an helicopter's.
     However, it has wings instead of a propeller.
     Uses "Fire Eth Shot". Fire-elemental Ether attack on one for about
     700 damage.
     Uses "Water Eth Shot". Water-elemental Ether attack on one for about
     700 damage.
     Uses "Wind Eth Shot". Wind-elemental Ether attack on one for about
     700 damage.
   Fuel Tank
     HP 1200, Exp 1, G 0.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 1/5 of one of your Gear's max Fuel. Fuel Tank
     will use this every time it's attacked.
     Uses "Self Destruct/Fire". Self-destructs and causes about 900 damage
     of Ether fire-elemental damage.
   Conjurer

   Keep going East, then South. Drop down the pit and take the chest
   containing a Ground. To get out of the pit, jump over the North pipe,
   then North outside the pit, then cross it jumping South. Keep going until
   you find a locked door. Check it, then go back into the pit. There's a
   small door to the North; get out of your Gears to enter it.


          B a b e l   T o w e r   C o m p u t e r   R o o m

   Items in this area: O2 Cylinder, Gold Nugget, E Circuit. 

   Have you noticed that this room is like a spaceship's bridge, but tilted
   over 90 degrees so that the floor is actually the East wall? This applies
   to the entire Babel Tower but this is the first place in which it is
   quite obvious. Anyway, go North and take the O2 Cylinder, then drop down
   and get the Gold Nugget and the E Circuit. Then, activate all of the
   computer's terminals. To exit this room, jump atop the computer, the
   center column and one of the chairs, then over the stairs. 


           B a b e l   T o w e r   U p p e r   F l o o r s

   Items in this area: Wind Veil Ar, Veil Doubler, Ice RodG, Fire Veil Ar.

   Enemies in this area:
   Gun Drone
   Conjurer

   Get out of the pit again, then keep going South through the now open
   door. You'll find another pit. Drop down inside it, then go a bit North
   to grab two chests containing a Wind Veil Ar and a Veil Doubler. Now keep
   going South.

   You'll find a circular large platform surrounded by pipes. Don't worry,
   you can't fall down. Get the Ice RodG and Fire Veil Ar in the chests,
   then enter the door at the other side.


              B a b e l   T o w e r   C i t y   A r e a

   Items in this area: Stone RodG, G-M10S Ammo, Gold Bullion, G-GG060 Ammo,
   Flare RodG, WaterVeil Ar.

   It leads to a large section which also makes the rotated state of the
   tower obvious (note that the East wall is always the floor). Also note
   that although there will be no random battles during this section,
   numerous points throughout it will trigger preset battles. They seem just
   like regular random battles, except that you cannot run from them. There
   are several types:

   Battle:
   Traffic Jam <sphere> x3

   Battle:
   Traffic Jam <tube>
     HP 1250, Exp 6000, G 1000. 
     Gear-sized. Long vertical tube with three rotating rotor blade-like
     things on its top, and a square flat shield/signal on its front part.
     Uses "No Entry Beam/Eth Atk". Ether attack for about 300 damage.
   Traffic Jam <sphere> x2

   Battle:
   Traffic Jam <tube> x2

   Battle:
   Gun Drone

   Battle:
   Conjurer x2

   The green Gear to the West will refill your fuel, though it doesn't sell
   any parts or weapons. Go South from here along the ground (i.e. don't go
   up the blocks) and get the chest with a Stone RodG inside. Go back North
   and climb the blocks to the South. Keep going South until you find a
   Traffic Jam (much bigger than when you fight them, no?). Jump over it
   and, after a battle, it will act as an elevator. When it reaches its
   peak, jump East to the side of a building. Go North along it and jump
   over to the next one. Now jump atop the Traffic Jam. I wouldn't bother
   with the chest to the North, it only containing G-M10S Ammo and that.
   Instead, wait for the sphere to reach the highest point and jump East to
   another building, then go South. Right behind the broken bridge tunnel
   that is between what would be two cylindrical towers, is a hidden chest
   with a Gold Bullion. Get it and continue South. Jump atop another Traffic
   Jam (battle included), wait until it reaches its highest point (the game
   will change to another section) and get off.

   Go North again, but note that behind this floor's bridge section there's
   a chest with G-GG060 Ammo... which you could buy at the Yggdrasil's Gear
   Shop for 200 G, I know ^_^;. Go northeast and drop down a hole in the
   East wall/the floor to get a Flare RodG. Exit that hole and drop West to
   reach the fourth Traffic Jam. You know what to do. Get off to the East,
   jump South to another building and get the chest with a WaterVeil Ar.
   There's a bit of a tricky jump now: you must jump down to a Traffic Jam
   you can't see. You can see it from the West part of the building, but not
   from it's East one, which is the one you must jump from. Get an idea of
   its location, then go up and East as much as you can. Use the roads in
   the East wall as a guide: the Traffic Jam is in the light gray part
   between the two darker roads.

   After you land over it and win the battle, disembark it to the South.
   Keep going South jumping from building to building. After you reach a
   wall, go West and touch the pipes to climb them.


                  T o p   O f   B a b e l   T o w e r

   Save in the Memory Cube, then head to the center of the platform to
   activate a sequence which will lead to a battle.

   Boss:
   Seibzehn
     HP 5500 (of a maximum of 8000), Exp 60000, G 10000. Leaves Ether Ar+1
     or Heavy Alloy.
     Gear-sized. Same description as Calamity. Huge, bulky Gear with twin
     engines on its back.
     Uses "Restore Frame HP". Recovers 400 HP.

   Due to Seibzehn's high defense, it would be advisable that you used Level
   2 Gear Skills. Very effective also are Ether attacks, since Seibzehn's
   Ether Defense is quite low. If you have Billy in your party, use his
   Square attack, as it counts as an Ether attack and will inflict about 600
   damage!

   After beating it, you'll be nowhere else than in Shevat.

   The small elevator to the South leads down to a room with Weltall, but
   not much else. The door Maria has entered leads to a chamber in which
   Seibzehn is kept. Here you can talk to the technicians and Maria, which
   will tell you about her and his father's story. Anyway, go back to the
   entrance and use the large central elevator.

   Items in this area: Dawn Rock.

   You can't enter the palace yet, thought. Before entering Aphel Aura,
   you should get the Dawn Rock in this area. Position yourself in front of
   the entrance to the Shevat palace (the angel statue), then walk Southwest
   through the radius. When you are touching the "outher wheel" of Shevat,
   press Cross to receive it. Information on how to this and the other two
   stones was kindly provided by Pauzanes Neto (shinji08@geocities.com),
   Daryl (daryl@dnet.net.id) and Jason F. Long (tobin@eldrick.simplenet.com).
   
   After that, head for Aphel Aura.


                         A p h e l   A u r a

   Items in this area: Aquasol S x2, Aquasol DX, Dark Rock, Dusk Rock.

   Doesn't Shevat's BGM just rock? Talk to the old man, he has quite some
   things to say. Follow his advice and press Cross over the Stepping Stone
   (it's that stone disc below the arc). It'll lead you down to a room with
   a Memory Cube you should promply make use of. You can take any of the
   doors to the Northwest and Southeast which lead to a ring-like room with
   many of Shevat's people. Go back to the circular room and now head
   downstairs. You'll find a room with what seems to be an escaped Aveh
   soldier. There's a door to the West that leads outside, cross it. If you
   go down the stair of floating stones, you can talk to an old woman.
   However, the interesting thing here is the Stepping Stone. It won't work,
   since you need the Dawn, Dusk and Dark stones. Remember this place, since
   you'll have to come here later when you have them.

   Go all the way back to the circular room and board the Stepping Stone.
   Once outside, go North, climb the stair, then the floating stones.
   Enter the door which leads to a bar. In here, you can put 20 G in the
   jukebox to hear some songs:

   The Valley of the Wind
   A Distant Promise
   Lost... Screeching Shards
   Our Village is No. 1
   We Wounded Follow the Light 
   The Strong Seek Dreams

   Exit the bar, then keep climbing the stones to the summit. Once there,
   you can talk to a woman. Now go down the floating stones stair. This time
   keep going round the building and down a stair. Before climbing the next
   stair, enter the door.

   Surprise! Welcome to the Chu-Chu tribe's quarters ^_^; A blue Chu-chu
   here will ask you about the land-dwelling people. If you speak the truth
   (that they're not always nice) he'll give you two Aquasol S and an
   Aquasol DX. The Chu-chu in the lamp will give you some cryptic hints
   about how to get the three stones. TALK TO HIM! That's because you can't 
   get the Dark rock from the fish (read below) unless you do! This seems
   to have been driving a lot of people mad, and I'm sorry for not having 
   noticed it before. Also, I'm afraid I've lost the mail of the person who 
   told me about it... sorry again -_-.

The Chu-chu behind the counter sells:

   Make sure you have enough Aquasol S, Zetasol, Physimentsol and Omegasol.
   After that, talk to the elderly green Chu-chu which will sell you
   equipment.

   Character Equipment:
   Thunder Rod            2200
   Stone Rod              2200
   Flare Rod              2600
   Ice Rod                2200
   Dynamite Rod           4500   
   Silver Blood           2800
   EthWind Ammo           1000

   Ether Stone             500
   AntiEthStone            500

   Get Elly a Dynamite Rod, and War Mails and Helms for anyone which you
   feel that needs them (since they're cheap, you can buy them for every
   party member). It's probably not worth getting Bart's Silver Blood since
   it's only a point more powerful than the Black Snake and it doesn't lower
   the enemy's Ether Defense, but that's up to you, as is whether to buy
   Billy's EthEarth and EthWater Ammo (the ones he doesn't have yet).

   In the East part of the lower floor of this room there is a Stepping
   Stone. Use it and it will take you to a beautiful room with a fountain
   (why can Fei walk over the water? Hmmm). Take the East door if you want
   to talk to a doctor and a soldier for more background info. Then come
   back and take the West door. Talk to the old man here and tell him you
   like to fish. He'll sell you some Spider Web for 50 G, unless you already
   had some from Lahan (yeah, that's all you earn for getting the Spider Web
   earlier... just 50 G :P).

   Now, before you start fishing, make sure you've talked to the Chu-Chu in 
   the lamp (see above). Then, go to the top of the fountain and press the 
   Cross button. Fei will start to fish (what's with RPGs and fishing 
   sub-games?). In any case, Zelda 64 this ain't... Fei will start saying the 
   time-honored "..." quote a random number of times until a fish bites (it 
   can get boring). When it does, you have three choices: reel it in, check 
   around or wait. By all means, choose to reel it in. One of two things will
   happen randomly; either you'll get the fish or the line will break (if
   that happens, buy some more from the old man). The other options can lead
   to nothing happening or the line breaking. Easy choice, no? Also, the two
   times I got the fish, I had selected to reel it in as my first choice.

   When you get the fish, Fei will extract the Dark Rock from its mouth and
   throw it back to the fountain. Thanks again to Pauzanes Neto
   (shinji08@geocities.com), Daryl (daryl@dnet.net.id) and Jason F. Long
   (tobin@eldrick.simplenet.com) for the info. 

   Once you have the stone, use the Stepping Stone and exit the Chu-chus'
   place. Keep going East up the stairs, then round the building. When you
   can go no further, take the passage to the Northwest. It will lead to
   another floating island. The West passage in here leads outside the city,
   so don't take it (you can talk to the old man in it if you want). Enter
   the door to the North and it will lead you to a new room. In here you can
   talk to three people. Jump over the Stepping Stone and go down.

   One of the guys in this room will sell you Gear parts.

   There's a lot of expensive stuff and it's not likely you'll be able to
   upgrade everything. Get the Chrono RodG, it's very powerful. I'm a power
   player (I prioritize Power instead of Defense) so I got K35-3500 engines
   for my party members first. But it's your choice.

   Now go up the Stepping Stone and exit the house. Take the Stepping Stone
   leading down in this very island. Take the bridge to the South and open
   the door. In this room, check the doll sitting on top of the table and
   you'll receive the Dusk Rock. With this, you have all three rocks. Climb
   the stairs and in the next room take the door to the East. Here, check
   the wooden horse to trigger a sequence.

   Once it is over, exit the house and take the Stepping Stone up. You
   should now exit Aphel Aura, but don't use the passage in this island.
   Instead, use the exit you came from initially, so you can go to the three
   rocks' room on the way out. If you don't remember how to go back, here's
   how:

   Head Southeast to the main island, and keep climbing clockwise until you
   reach the bridge leading South. Take the Stepping Stone down. Head
   downstairs and take the door to the West. Now hop onto the Stepping Stone
   and press Cross. BTW, the sequence right now appeared at the end of the
   Demo disc.


               A p h e l   A u r a   S e c r e t   R o o m 

   Items in this area: Chu-chu Idol, Power Crisis, Panalphasol, Hob-Steak,
   Physimentsol, Samson's Hair, Yamato Belt, Hard Star, Speed Star, ETH
   Drive, VIT Drive, STR Drive, ETHDEF Drive, HP Drive, EP Drive.

   Once in the secret room, check the table to the East to get a Chu-chu
   Idol. It's an Accesory and it can only be equipped by a character you
   don't have now, so it won't appear in your inventory. Now check the shelf
   just opposite that (to the West) for a whole bunch of items (everything
   else listed in the "Items in this area" section). Additionally, you can
   check the bookshelf to the North for some text. When done, take the
   Stepping Stone and head out of Aphel Aura (save along the way if you
   want), and into the Palace.


                     S h e v a t   P a l a c e

   Maria will be waiting for you when you arrive. She'll tell you to go to
   Queen Zephyr's chamber, but you, being a curious RPG gamer, won't do that
   immediatelly ^_^. I'll number the doors in the palace clockwise, starting
   from the one to the North. 

   Well, except for room 2 (the resting room), everything you can get in the
   palace is information. However, it is REALLY important information, to
   the point that I begin to question if it was wise leaving it as an
   optional event (not to mention that Shevat itself is quite a sight to
   behold). Therefore, I strongly reccomend you listen to everyone here, or
   at least the people in rooms 7, 10, 11 and 12.

   1 (directly to the North) : Queen Zephyr's chamber. Not yet.
   2 (to the Northeast) : Resting room. There are some beds in which you can
     rest, and a Memory Cube.
   3, 4, 5, 6 (the doors in the balcony and the one below it) : The people
     in these rooms will provide you with juicy information.
   7 (to the Southeast) : Yui and Midori are in this room! Ask Yui why is
     that. BTW, is it just me or is the Chu-chu in this room being a bit
     sarcastic? ^_^;
   8 (to the South) : Not sure, but judging from the people here, it would
     be some kind of supply depot. Not much else to do than talk.
   9 (the door where you can go no further around the room) : After a
     hallway, you'll come to a room full of cages. Keep going East to
     another hallway. In this one you can take a door to the North to se a
     huge machine, apparently used to sleep criminals. Return to the hallway
     and head downstairs. In this final room, you can only talk to a woman
     which will throw more cryptic info at you ^_^. You can't do anything
     about the huge cage-ish thing, so return to the main palace section.
  10 (to the Southwest, you must retrace a bit from the last one and go up a
     stair to reach it) : The laboratory. You will receive info from the
     people here. There are quite some really interesting revelations in
     fact.
  11 (to the West) : Tactical command room. More important revelations. 
  12 (to the Northwest) : The library. Yet more truly fascinating optional
     info (probably the most important in the entire Shevat). The people in
     the inner ring tell a full story which starts with the one that is to
     your right if you enter the ring straight from the outside door. Then
     follow counterclockwise. Bart will make an additional comment if he's
     in your party when you talk to one of them. 

   OK, once you have your head about to burst with all that info, go through
   door 1 to meet Queen Zephyr...

   ... but not yet. In the next room, you can talk to Wiseman and Maria.
   If you want, you can take the West door and after a good climb, you'll
   reach the top of the palace, though there's no one there yet.

   Take the East door, however, and it'll lead you to an apparently empty
   room. You can check the picture in the Northeast shelf to get a reaction
   from Fei, but not much more. Go back and head North to meet Zephyr at
   last.

   Once your meeting with her is over, do as she says and rest in room 2
   (the door to the Northeast from the palace's main section). Go see Zephyr
   again and answer that your heart is set.


        =======================================================
        E P I S O D E   3 7   :   I n t r u d e r   A l e r t !
        =======================================================


                     S h e v a t   P a l a c e

   After that there will be a sequence, and then you'll be asked who should
   be left behind to make room for Maria... ooops, I mean, to protect
   Zephyr. Right. ^_^; Then Maria will join your party.

   Maria's initial equipment: Battle Dress, Silver Beret, Body Guard.
   Seibzehn's initial equipment: Extra Ar +4, Extra Ar +4, Frame HP30.
   Engine : S50-6600. Frame: #17-18000. Armor: Z Alloy50/20.

   Both Maria and Seibzehn's equipment is quite good. In fact you might want
   to equip some of it on Fei!

   Once you exit Zephyr's chamber, a Chu-chu will offer to sell you things.

   All this is the same stuff that could be bought in Aphel Aura, so there's
   not much point unless you forgot to buy something. Save in the rest room
   if you want, then take the elevator down. When you reach Shevat's map
   (notice that the energy barrier is, indeed, gone), head for the Central
   Dock Entrance. However, the elevator wil stop before reaching it, and you
   will enter an emergency shaft instead.

     Abilities which inflict physical damage (like Robo Punch). Also, all
     elemental Ethers will heal it. Non-elemental Ethers are fair play.
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs all of a character's EP.
   Forbidden
     HP 500, Exp 12912, G 5. Leaves Gold Nugget if beaten before it releases
     from the slab.
     Character-sized. Looks like a brown humanoid lizard tied to a stone
     slab. All physical attacks except Skill enders will inflict 1 damage,
     and all elemental Ethers will heal it. Forbidden can't attack until it
     is released from the stone slab.
     Uses "HP 500". Forbidden uses this right at the beginning of the fight
     to let you know how many HP you have.
     Uses <No Name>. Releases itself from the stone slab.
     Uses "Mighty Blow/Damage = HP Lost". Like it says, the damage inflicted
     is Forbidden's Max HP (500) minus its current HP. Also, even though
     this message is only displayed for its first attack, ALL of Forbidden's
     physical attacks are this one.
   Tears
     HP 600, Exp 13785, G 1111.
     Character-sized. Green, vaguely humanoid thing with a single leg, a
     pointy head and blades for fingers. All elemental Ethers will heal it.
     Uses "Unification increases PWR". A Tears will use this when the other
     Tears is defeated. Extremely dangerous power-up, since it raises
     Defense Power so much that regular attacks will do 1 damage, besides
     substituting Tears' regular attack for <No Name> below.
     Uses <No Name>. Five consecutive physical attacks on random party
     members for about 150-200 damage each (fortunatelly misses often).

   OK, some notes about the enemies first.
   The information about beating Forbiddens before they can release to get 
   Gold Nuggets is from Mastermacros (mastermacros@earthlink.net). It 
   happens randomly, but quite often.
   When confronting Gimmicks, attack them with six Triangle button attacks
   to beat them quickly. 
   Running from Tears and especially Forbiddens is safer than fighting them 
   due to their characteristics. If you try to kill Forbiddens, however, try 
   to concentrate your attacks on one of them and kill it before it attacks 
   (that way you'll sometimes get a Gold Nugget, see above). At any cost, 
   don't allow them to attack you when they're near death, since they'll 
   surely kill whoever they attack. 
   Tears, however, need the opposite approach: keep both of them alive until 
   they are weak, then finish them at the same time.

   Head North, then take the West path to take the Shevat Map (it's not for
   the floor you're in, though). Go back East and keep going East. Jump over
   the fallen arch, then cross the door. Go down the spiral stair (hold
   Circle, Right and L1 to descend it easily) and take the door to the
   North.

   Take the East path and go down the elevator. Open the chest containing
   the Queen's Rod. Equip it if you want; it's a bit less powerful than the
   Dynamite Rod but it lowers the enemy's Ether Power. Hop back onto the
   elevator. Go back South, West and then North, and take the elevator down.

   Go West and take the ladder down. Ignore the next ladder down, it's for
   climbing back up if you fall down during the next section. Check the
   green jewel here, and Maria will tell you that it's for reversing the
   rotorblades. So activate it and jump onto one of them (it's not as easy
   as it seems, for some reason). Don't get too close to the axis or you
   might fall off. When you're on the other side, jump off. Climb down the
   ladder and use the elevator.

   As Maria says, you can use the map in this section. Some explanations are
   in order to understand it, though.
   The three differently-colored zones (blue, green and gray) represent
   three different height levels. The Blue zone (the one you are in now) is
   below the Green one and above the Gray one. The Grey zone has two
   sections, the smaller one being below the bigger. 
   Also, the circles in the map represent spiral staircases which connect
   the sections. From right to left the staircases connect the two sections
   of zone Gray, zone Gray with zone Blue, zone Blue with zone Green, and
   Zone Gray with zone Blue again.
   Finally, all hallway dead ends (which seem a bit round in the map)
   contain chests. The rectangular room in zone Green contains two chests.

   You're the white arrow in the Northeast corner. Go straight South all the
   way to a chest containing a Battle Apron. It's an accesory which adds 5
   to both Attack and Defense of it's wearer, so I'd suggest you wore it
   immediately. Go back North until you find the first cross-road; then go
   West. Your target is the Green zone, so take the staircase to the South.

   Once there, go East and North to get the Aquasol DX and Rosesol DX in the
   small room, and the Ruby Helmet (it can only be equipped by female
   characters) from the lone chest to the East. Go back to zone Blue after
   this.

   If you take the West staircase, Big Joe (ummm... as always, "what's he
   doing here?") will inform you that the door can't be open. So instead,
   use the one to the east. The shortest route is North, then East until you
   reach it.

   Enter the Black zone and go West until you find a crossroad, then take
   the South path to get the Whip-Lasher. Equip it on Bart if he's in your
   party, then go back to the crossroad and continue West. In the new
   crossroad, go South and take the stairway to the second section of zone
   Gray. Take the chest with an Econometer in it. This awesome accesory has
   the same use than the Gold Hairpin in FF3US, i.e. it halves EP usage!
   I equipped it on Maria because her Ethers are quite good. Anyway, go back
   to the main section of zone Gray, and keep going North. When you get near
   the other side of the blocked door Big Joe could not open, you'll be
   attacked.

   Battle: 
   Gimmick x3

   Easy. Just tap Triangle like a madman. Once it's over go North until you
   find the elevator leading to the exit (you could cross the unblocked
   door, but all Big Joe says is that he's thinking about life. Weird guy).

   Save in the Memory Cube. As before, ignore the ladder going down and
   instead go East. Jump over the two gaps in the descending ramp (if you
   fall down, climb back up using the aforementioned ladder). Keep going
   East and descend the two consecutive ladders. Go West and you'll meet
   another rotorblade thing. Hop onto it, then when you reach another one,
   switch before you fall down. Jump to safety to the West when you reach
   the other side. Don't worry about the green jewel, I think it's just for
   if you want to go back. Board the elevator and activate it.

   Go South, jump over the arch and open the door. Descend the long
   staircase and exit. Another hallway and staircase will follow. Then,
   you'll reach a hallway with a crossroad. The West branch leads to a
   Memory Cube, so go that way first, save then go back and take the South
   path. As Maria suggests, go down the manhole.

   None of the elevators work, so use the door that leads to the hangar.
   Sequence time (hey, I didn't rememebr Achtzehn being so cool!) then it's
   onto...

                     S h e v a t   P a l a c e

   You'll be asked to assign four of your characters to defend as many
   generators. Each generator will be attacked by one enemy group you'll
   have to defeat with that character alone, so choose wisely. You should
   assign Elly to the first generator, then your best three characters in
   order of worst to best to the other three. Also, make sure that the
   character for the fourth generator has the ability of recovering Armor
   Loss (remember that it is recovered using Ethers that heal HP when used
   on characters, i.e. Fei's InnerHealing, Citan's Sazanami or Billy's
   HealingLight or Holy Light). I myself chose Elly, Bart, Billy and Fei.

   After assigning your characters, and confirming your choice, you'll be
   given the option to buy and change equipment, do so (first choice).
   You'll be able to roam Shevat. You can even go to Seibzehn's hangar,
   though not Aphel Aura nor the dock. Also, in the Resting Room of the
   Palace you will find Margie who, as usual, will let you change party
   members. Take advantage of this oportunity to buy equipment from the
   Chu-chu in the Palace for the four Gears you'll be using. Then equip
   them (you'll need to change party members at Margie to equip their
   Gears) and save your game. Now go back to Queen Zephyr's chamber.

   You'll now be given yet another chance to change the assignments. Then
   it's onto the battles! You can choose the order in which you want to
   fight the battles. The only point for this is equipping the spoils of war
   left from the first battles in the latter ones (you're given the chance
   of changing your equipment before each battle), but it won't make much
   difference anyway. OK, here are the battles.

   Generator 1 : "Two small Gears and Solaris troops"

   Battle:
   Solaris Guard x6
     HP 200, Exp 2400, G 500.
     Character-sized. Alien-looking armored guard. Has red spots on helmet.
   Littlefoot x2
     HP 600, Exp 300, G 0. Leaves Silver Ar.
     Gear-sized. Small, white bipedal Gear with a cannon.
     Uses "Short Beam/Beam Atk". Beam attack on one for about 350 damage.

   The real threat in this battle comes from the Solaris Guards. For some
   reason, they inflict like 200 damage while the Littlefoots do 30. Since
   there are six of them, you'll be toasted unless you dispose of them fast.
   That's why you will need Elly for this job, as she's the only one who can
   cast attack Ethers with area effect. Unfortunatelly she can't hit all
   Guards at once but two at a time, but even that will be a huge advantage.
   Once the Guards are disposed off, the Littlefoots pose little (heh)
   threat.

   Generator 2 : "3 White Knights"

   Battle:
   White Knight x3
     HP 290, Exp 2800, G 500. Leaves Ether Ar, Lite Ar +1.
     Gear-sized. As the name implies, it's a Gear which looks like a white
     medieval knight.

   The White Knights are extremelly fast, and they'll most likely perform
   two actions for every one of yours. Since they damage you for about 500
   HP each time, you need to dispose of them fast. It's very likely that
   you'll beat them with single Cross attacks, but if not, do the following.
   Attack one with a Cross attack then do the same thing again (he should be
   destroyed). Now you have Attack Level 2. Release a Level 1 Skill on each
   one of the remaining Knights.

   Generator 3 : "Special attack Gear and 1 White Knight"

   Battle:
   White Knight x2
   Citadel
     HP 6000, Exp 1600, G 20000. Leaves Gold Plate.
     Gear-sized. Large spider-like Gear.
     Uses "Gel Breath/Gel Atk". Gel attack on one for about 3000 damage.

   Um. ONE White Knight? Am I seeing double? Well anyway, things are
   starting to get rough. Dispose of the Knights first, then use the earned
   Attack Level to attack the Citadel. This is a worthy opponent: it does
   high damage and has lots of HP. Fortunatelly its defense is low and he's
   only one. You might have to heal once. BTW, while in the former two
   battles Booster would help things, in this and the next one it's almost a
   neccesity.

   Generator 4 : "Power Gear and 1 White Knight"

   Battle:
   White Knight x2
   Avalanche
     HP 5000, Exp 4800, G 20000. Leaves Noise Filter.
     Gear-sized. Large worm-like green Gear with twin tusk-like drills.
     Uses "Avalanche Drill". Causes 20% of Armor Loss.

   Um. ONE White Knight? Am I...? Oh, forget it. 
   As before, turn on Booster and dispose of the White Knights. When
   Avalanche uses its drills, it might be a good idea to recover that lost
   armor. Remember that Armor Loss is cumulative, BTW, so if it does it
   twice on you (Armor Loss will be 40%), recover it immediatelly, or its
   attacks will inflict a whooping 5000 damage!

   Once it's over, Chu-chu will, to say the least, surprise everyone.

   Boss:
   Achtzehn
     HP 3000, Exp 20000, G 0. 
     Gear-sized. Huge, bulky red Gear that resembles Seibzehn in its
     structure (it has two large engines at its back, etc). Has a big cannon
     floating by its side.

   All of Achtzehn's attacks will inflict zero damage on Chu-chu, so this is
   the easiest battle in the game.
   However... After more sequences, you'll have to fight Achtzehn again,
   with Seibzehn.

   Boss:
   Achtzehn
     HP 12000, Exp 30000, G 10000. Leaves WizardryRing.
     Gear-sized. Huge, bulky red Gear that resembles Seibzehn in its
     structure (it has two large engines at its back, etc). Has a big cannon
     floating by its side.
     Uses <No Name>. Achtzehn combines with its cannon and attacks thrice
     for about 800 damage each.

   A true battle of titans this is. However, the sheer power of Seibzehn
   will make things quite easy. Note that Seibzehn has Level Three Skills
   should you want to use them.

                     S h e v a t   P a l a c e

   If you check your Skill lists now, you'll realize that a lot more
   unlearnt ones will be displayed now. That's because of wise man Gaspar
   removing all your Limiters, which gives all of your characters 7 AP per
   turn! Also, you should equip the Wizardry Ring on anyone that's a bit low
   on Skills to improve it's learning rate. There's nothing more you can do
   here, so head back to the lower dock and take the elevator to the South
   leading down.

   You'll be on the Yggdrasil's deck, so go inside and, as always, talk to
   Sigurd to launch it. However, you're in for a surprise: Shevat's
   engineers have modified it at it can now fly! Aside from that, don't
   bother going to the Gear shop because they haven't updated their stuff,
   for some reason. Unless, of course, you want to change Seibzehn's name to
   Siebzehn (it's correct spelling) by talking to the guy in black there.

   As in every RPG at this point, having a flying vehicle opens up quite
   some parts of the World Map.


     W o r l d   M a p   ( S o u t h e a s t   I s l a n d s   A r e a )

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Tusk-Tusk
     HP 6200, Exp 9500, G 0. Leaves Ivory, Fang.
     Gear-sized. Looks like a green elephant standing on two legs. Not
     pretty.
   Lil'Allemange

   Enemies in rocky areas:
   Griffon
   Wels

   Enemies in icy areas:
   Golem
     HP 20, Exp 4500, G 0.
     Gear-sized. Blue, thin, hunched humanoid giant. I've not been able to
     inflict any damage on it, let alone beat it: the Exp and G stats were
     obtained via an Action Replay.
   Dragon
     HP 18000, Exp 13500, G 0. Leaves Devil Dress.
     Gear-sized. Black dragon alright, but it's made out of polygons which
     make him look kind of skeletal or machine-like.

   It might be a good idea to beat a couple of dragons to get some Devil
   Dresses for Elly, Maria and Chu-Chu. Other than that, not much of
   interest here.


     W o r l d   M a p   ( N o r t h w e s t   I s l a n d s   A r e a )

   Enemies in grasslands areas:
   Slugger
     HP 50, Exp 1500, G 0. 
     Character-sized. Best described as a cross between a worm and a
     chicken. Scary, huh? Has the lower quarters of the former and upper of
     the latter.
   Croaker Tribe
     HP 800, Exp 2155, G 0. 
     Character-sized. Robed lizarmand with a spear.

   Enemies in forest areas:
   Lil' Allemange

   Nothing to do here neither. These two monster listings aren't complete,
   however; I kind of got tired after three hours at 3 AM.


                       W o r l d   M a p

   OK, so here's a list of all places you can revisit:

   One of the first doors in the 'Ethos' Dig Site is broken, so no further
   access there.

   There's nobody in Bart's Lair and the elevator is gone.

   Bledavik is still under martial law so no luck here either.

   You still can't enter the lighthouse in the largest Aquvy island. Don't
   bother, it won't open up until the end of the game.

   The 'Ethos' H.Q. can be entered but it's not too interesting to do so
   since there's no one alive there.

   The large door after the Goliath Factory Entrance is locked. However, in
   the entrance itself there are now random encounters with Hatamoto Mk3 and
   Mechanics.

   You can dock the Yggdrasil at Shevat, Thames or the Babel Tower. In this
   last case you will do so quite high up, in the terrace in which you
   fought Ramsus (in Wyvern) and Miang. However, don't do so since you'll be
   going there not much later in the game. Also, Shevat moves around in the
   map but it's position is shown in the world map like a city's.

   You can enter Nortune, and some people have changed their speech. You
   might want to try it out at the Battling if you haven't done so before.
   Also, you aren't allowed at the Central district.

   Finally, you can also enter the Mountain Path, the Blackmoon Forest,
   Dazil, and the Orphanage, but unless you left something in any of these
   there's no point in going back, since nothing has changed (not even
   Dazil's 'Ethos' facility, oddly enough).

   You might have noted that I have left out Nisan. Right enough, for
   there's where you are going next.


                            N i s a n

   After a sequence, you'll have to face some guards.

   Battle:
   ShakhanGuard <slim> x4
     HP 200, Exp 6518, G 45. Leaves Aquasol, Rosesol.
     Character-sized. Same description as an Aveh Soldier. Soldier with
     brown helmet and aviation glasses on.
     Uses <No Name>. Attacks physically thrice for about 10 damage each.

   You can't run from this battle, but mashing the Triangle button will be
   enough. They're really weak.
   After that, you'll be in Nisan, but there will be no one except guards
   which will run towards you. Each time you touch any of them you'll enter
   a battle exactly the same as the above one. Since you have to rid the
   city of all guards, just stand still and beat them in turn..

   After that and another sequence, you'll be able to move around Nisan.
   In the house that is a little Southeast from the one you were in, you can
   check the counter to "buy" items (you take the item and leave the money,
   you're that honest).

   Apart from that, there's nothing you can do neither in Nisan here nor in
   the Cathedral, since both are deserted. So head for the East or West exit
   from Nisan. Go round the lake to the back of the mountain, and talk to
   Margie.

   Go down the long stairs, then... go down a lot more. After a sequence, a
   choice will pop up: to try to open the mausoleum entrance yourself or let
   Margie do it. I choose the first one. There is a panel in the wall a
   little East of the door. Check it then choose to move it. Once you enter
   the place, you'll be attacked.

   Battle:
   ShakhanGuard <type 2> x4
     HP 250 (of a maximum of 350), Exp 6528, G 65.
     Character-sized. Same description as an Aveh Corporal. Bigger soldier
     with white helmet and aviation glasses on his head.
     Uses <No Name>. Attacks physically thrice for about 20 damage each.
   Shakhan Monk x2
     HP 200 (of a maximum of 300), Exp 1101, G 500.
     Character-sized. Same description as Assassin <priest>. Green-clad
     priest with his arms in cross.
     Uses "Net". Causes "Stop".
     Uses "Net". Causes "Forget".
     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 100 damage.
     Uses "Healing Light". Restores 100 HP.
   Margie
     HP 999, Exp N/A, G N/A.
     Character-sized. Girl with a red cape. Cannot be targeted by anyone.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 60 HP to a party member.

   After the battle, take the elevator to the North. Follow the winding
   hallway and open the North door. Then, ignore the Northeast path and take
   the West one to another door. After a (somewhat funny) sequence, you'll
   be in a pilot r- er, bridge. Get the chest containing a Desert Worm
   (don't worry, it's just a whip for Bart. Equip it) and save in the Memory
   Cube. Take the North door and keep going. At the crossroad, ignore the
   Southwest path (it leads to the Northeast path you ignored in the
   junction before). So, go East.

   This leads to another elevator, use it. Now take the Northwest path. In
   the next hallway (which goes round and ends where the Southwest path
   ended), all doors are in its South wall. Ignore the first and second ones
   and take the third door. At the end of the hallway, pick the DeathBlower1
   in the chest. Since it's very likely you'll have one equiped on Weltall
   already, you should put it on Brigandier. Don't bother entering the door,
   you can't do anything in the room on the other side. Instead, go back to
   the second door and enter it. At the end of the hallway, there's a locked
   door to the West, but enter the one to the East. Here, check the retina
   checking device to open the locked door, then save. Go back to the locked
   door and cross it.

   In the next, large room, follow the broad path with lights at its sides
   into another room. After the sequence, check the throne's part that is
   between the Gear's legs. Now go back to the bridge room (you need to go
   back to the curved segment, to the Y style crossroad, down the elevator,
   take the Northwest path and cross the door.

   In here you'll find a surprise: the tool guy. He'll sell you the same
   items and equipment you could buy at his place in Nisan when he was
   absent, though. Anyhow, save, then check the control panel a bit to the
   left.

   OK, after the scene, you know where to go... the room with the Gear. On
   your way there, however, you'll encounter some guards that'll force you
   to battle them if they touch you. There are three possibilities:

   Battle:
   ShakhanGuard <type 2> x4

   Battle:
   ShakhanGuard <type 2> x4
   Shakhan Monk x2

   Battle:
   Freelancer x3
     HP 420, Exp 8700, G 500.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Sand Man. Looks like a Tusken
     Raider in a raincoat.
     Uses "Targeting Arms!". Lowers a character's ATK.
     Uses "Targeting Legs!". Causes "Stop".
     Uses "Meteorstrike". Causes 1 damage to Freelancer. (?)
     Uses "Rat Fever". Causes 1 damage to Freelancer. (?)

   These battles can be escaped, fortunatelly. However, in the hallway
   with the doors leading to the second Jasper check and the large circular
   room, you'll have to fight a battle which can't be escaped.

   Battle:
   ShakhanGuard <type 2> x4
   Shakhan Monk x2

   A sequence will take place then. Go to the large circular room to
   activate another one, then a battle.

   Battle:
   Neo Etone <type 1> x2
     HP 3300, Exp 15255, G 5000. Leaves Seal Ar, Seal Barrier.
     Gear-sized. Same description as Etone. Caped purple Gear with a
     levitating scepter spinning around it.
     Uses "Seal". Seal attack for about 2500 damage.

   Andvari does more damage that your other Gears but, even without it, this
   battle would be easy.

   Another sequence (I'm rather sure that the "true power" Citan is hinting
   at are the Infinity Level Skills) and then...


        ===================================================
        E P I S O D E   4 0   :   G a t e 1   - M a r g i e
        ===================================================


                            N i s a n

   Andvari's initial equipment: <Whatever was equipped on Brigandier>.
   Engine : G45-4600. Frame: BRIG-18500. Armor: RX Metal 60.

   Your party will remain the same as before. However, the other member
   apart from Fei and Bart can be changed for any of the present ones (yup,
   includind Citan) just by talking to them.

   Even though Andvari's whip and accesories are the same as the ones you
   had on Brigandier, its new engine, frame and armor will make it quite
   more powerful than most of your other Gears for a while.

   The innkeeper has returned to it's place, and he'll let you stay for
   free. Also, the tool guy is back to its shop as well, and he now sells
   Gear parts as well.

   This is, however, the same as in Shevat, so it's up to you. Anyhow, exit
   Nisan and head West for the Ignas' Gate Cave.


                   I g n a s '   G a t e   C a v e

   Head a bit North to trigger a battle.

   Battle:
   Neo Etone x2

   Equip the Seal Barriers (I got two the first time, then one and a Seal Ar
   the second one) on Weltal and Andvari, because the next boss does a Seal
   attack. A WaterVeil Ar would also help, since it can perform a Fire Ether
   too. Preferably on Andvari; since it's equipped with RX Metal 60 he won't
   have any Ether Armor. Keep going North and open the door. After a
   sequence you'll fight the main bald guy at last.

   Boss:
   Shakhan
     HP 18000 (of a maximum of 20000, Exp 21735, G 30000. Leaves Ether Ar+1.
     Gear-sized. Floating Gear whose lower torso and legs are replaced by a
     sphere. Its left hand is a fork and its right one a shield with the
     Ethos symbol.
     When not attached to the Gate:
     Uses "Seal Punch". Seal attack for about 2000 damage.
     Uses "Start absorbing gate energy". Attaches itself to the Gate.
     Uses <No Name>. Counters any attack by attacking physically for about
     1200 damage.
     When attached to the Gate:
     Uses "Can't reach to hit you". Counters any attack by trying to attack
     you, but can't reach. In other words, this does nothing.
     Uses "Absorbing gate energy". Restores 1000 HP.
     Uses "Absorbing gate energy". Counters any attack by restoring 1000 HP.
     Uses "Ignas Storm/Fire Eth". Ether attack for about 2500 fire damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Retracts the cable.

   This is a VERY difficult fight. Start by turning Booster on. Shakhan will
   attach to the Gate right away, but this first time that's no problem
   because he won't counter by healing yet, instead he'll unsuccesfully try
   to attack you. Still, he'll heal when his turns comes. When he unplugs,
   just keep attacking. He'll counterattack every time, but you have no
   choice. You want to damage him as much as possible before he plugs to the
   gate again.
   When he attaches himself again, DON'T attack him. He'll heal 1000 HP each
   time, and it's very unlikely you'll inflict more damage than that. What's
   worse, he'll cure himself in every one of his turns. There's nothing you
   can do about that, just turn booster off, charge fuel and pray he
   disconnects quickly. Once he unplugs again, start attacking again. Don't
   bother to turn Booster on because he'll attach himself to the gate
   shortly, and besides, you need the fuel to heal. Repeat this pattern and
   you might win. Your best hope is the Andvari: with a DeathBlower1
   equipped, he can inflict 2000 damage each two turns by means of its T,X
   Skill.
   For the record, when I managed to beat him it was before he connected for
   the second time. I was also using Elly to demonstrate that you could do
   it even without a strong character as the third.

   When the battle is over, just go South to exit the cave. Many sequences
   will lead you to...


        =================================================
        E P I S O D E   4 1   :   G a t e 2   - B a b e l 
        =================================================


            W o r l d   M a p   ( B l e d a v i k   A r e a )

   You can enter Bledavik if you want. You have access to all areas now,
   including the castle. Most every person has changed their speech, and
   there are even new people (returned soldiers mostly). Going through a
   passageway between the two Northwest stalls will lead you to a rather
   cute representation by some kids. You can now get any items that you
   left out earlier if you want (like I did with the kitchen's meat), but
   chances are they'll be as useful as Blizzard 1 against Shiva by now.
   Also, Shakhan Square has been renamed Bartholomew Square, but the fair is
   gone :(.
   You can also land the Yggdrasil upon the Ft. Jasper, but it won't be of
   much use either.

   Enter the Yggdrasil and head for the Babel Tower.


                       B a b e l   T o w e r

   Once you dock here, you'll switch to Bart and be prompted to make a party
   of three people. Then you'll switch again to Fei's group. You have to
   make your way to the computer room you saw in your first visit here. In
   case you don't remember, you have to go East, South and into the pit,
   then get out of your Gears and open the small door. BTW, there don't seem
   to be any enemies around here anymore
   After a short sequence, you'll face Dominia and Kelvena (which might or
   might not have actually been spelled "Cherubena").

   Boss:
   Bladegash
     HP 4000, Exp 25512, G 5000. Leaves EP Drive.
     Gear-sized. Red and white Gear wielding a Sword.
     Uses "Wind Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack wind-elemental and more
     damaging.
     Uses "Fire Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack fire-elemental and more
     damaging.
     Uses "Earth Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack earth-elemental and
     more damaging.
     Uses "Water Sword". Makes Bladegash' next attack water-elemental and
     more damaging.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 1600 HP.
   Marinebasher
     HP 5000 (of a maximum of 6000), Exp 25512, G 5000.
     Gear-sized. Blue Gear-ish swordfish.
     Uses <No Name>. Water-elemental attack on all for about 1200 damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 2400 HP.

   Not too difficult, even though you only have Fei and Elly. Dispose of
   Dominia (Bladegash) first, it's a lot faster than Marinebasher and it has
   less HP, plus it heals less often. If you try to defeat Marinebash first,
   Bladegash will probably mince you in the meantime. You'll have to fight
   this and the next battle once again each before being able to heal, so
   manage your resources well.

   After that, your other group will have to fight the other two Elements,
   Tolone and Seraphita.

   Boss:
   Skyghene
     HP 5000 (of a maximum of 6000), Exp 25512, G 5000. Leaves ETH Drive.
     Gear-sized. Yellow and blue Gear-ish pterodactyl.
     Uses <No Name>. Flyies up and dives thrice for about 1000 physical
     damage each time.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 2400 HP.
   Grandgrowl
     HP 6000, Exp 25512, G 5000. Leaves VIT Drive.
     Gear-sized. Red and white Gear-ish winged lion.
     Uses <No Name>. Restores 2400 HP.

   Not too difficult either. It would be best to start off with Skyghene:
   again, it's the biggest threat and has the less HP.

   Then, you'll have to fight these battles again.

   Boss:
   Bladegash
   Marinebasher

   It's exactly the same battle as before, right down to the Exp, G and
   items won, so refer to the stats above. However, for some reason
   Bladegash seemed to parry and evade quite a lot more than before, to
   the point of becoming annoying. Maybe it's just me.
   Of course, there IS something different... you're not at full HP/Fuel.
   Be careful, especially if you used Booster.

   Boss:
   Skyghene
   Grandgrowl

   Same as before too.

   After this, there'll be a sequence and you'll be in the Yggdrasil.


        =======================================================
        E P I S O D E   4 2   :   G a t e 3   - T h e   D e e p

                        Y g g d r a s i l

   Head for Thames and dock in.


                      T h a m e s   D o c k

   Go to the bridge to talk with the man of the sea, I mean, captain. He'll
   quite conveniently fix your Gears so that they can stand high pressures.
   He'll also tell you to check the Gear shop in the Northeast corner of the
   Supply Entrance. It actually has stuff that's new to you, so go check it.

   Items in this area: Mermaid Mail, Dark Rod, DeathBlower2.

   Enemies in this area:
   Medusoid <type 2>
     HP 400, Exp 7500, G 0. Leaves Mica.
     Gear-sized. Same description as a Medusoid <type 1>. Jellyfish-looking
     creature.
     Uses "Charging". Loses a turn, but uses "Flash" the next one.
     Uses "Flash". Causes "Camera Damaged".
     Uses "Electric Atk". Electricity-elemetal attack for about 600
     damage.
   Merman   
     HP 2300, Exp 9504, G 500. Leaves Insulated Ar.
     Gear-sized. Blue spear-wielding Gear with a missile on its back closely
     resembling a submarine.
     Uses "Electric Atk". Electricity-elemetal attack for about 1000
     damage.
     Uses <No Name>. Launches the missile on its back for physical damage.
     After launching it, Merman becomes Significantly weaker in all
     respects.
   Aragonite
     HP 800, Exp 14888, G 3000. 
     Gear-sized. Blue, somewhat bulky, swimming Gear with a thee-fingered
     right claw and a launcher on its left arm.
     Uses "Electric Atk". Electricity-elemetal attack for about 500
     damage.
   Salvager
     HP 2500, Exp 7200, G 0. Leaves Gold Nugget.
     Gear-sized. Short, fat Gear, not unlike a submarine with legs and arms.
     Uses "Found a Gold Nugget!". Digs in the floor, then jumps happily. I
     thought it would give these items when defeated, but no. I have no clue.
     Uses "Found Insulated Armor!". Digs in the floor, then jumps happily. 
     Uses <No Name>. Digs in the floor, but finds nothing.
   Death Scythe <type 2>
     HP 9000, Exp 30321, G 0. Leaves Fang.
     Gear-sized. Same description as a Death Scythe <type 1>. Purple,
     humanoid cross between a shark and a ghost.

   During this dungeon, you can press the jump button (Triangle) at an even
   pace to swim. Used in conjunction with holding down the run button
   (Circle), it will make you go quite fast.

   If you go South you'll be given the option of returning to the Yggdrasil.
   However that wouldn't be very heroic would it? ^_^; Go North and in the
   intersection go East (the West path is a dead end so ignore it). In the
   next crossroad, go East. When you see light above you, jump repeateadly
   while going South. You'll surface in an air-filled cave. Get the Mermaid
   Mail (if Elly is in your party you should equip it on her). Save in the
   Memory Cube, then dive back into the pool.

   Go back South to the intersection, and take the West path now. In the next
   junction, a strong current from the East will push you to the South. You
   have to cross to the West branch when it stops briefly, using the "hold
   Circle, tap Triangle" technique described above. It will probably take you
   some tries though.

   Keep going North and eventually jump up to reach another cave containing a
   Dark Rod you'll promptly grab, and another treasure chest which will
   deactivate the current. Go back to the junction and take the East tunnel,
   which is covered in seaweed (isn't this getting a bit scary? ^_^;).
   The tunnel will suck you (don't worry, you can still go back... I think).
   Get an awesome DeathBlower2 from the chest and equip it to whoever is
   in conditions of performing the T,X Skill. Now cross the door. It's boss
   time.

     HP 14800, Exp 253260, G 10000. 
     Gear-sized. Slim Gear without arms. Instead, it has two blue wings
     coming out from its head.
     Uses <No Name>. Emeralda uses any of her Ether attacks for about 1500
     air, fire, earth or water-elemental damage on one or all, depending on
     the Ether used.

   Useless fact: the BGM playing during this boss fight is "Mermaid of the
   Godless Month", also known as "June Mermaid", since the godless month is
   how one of the twelve months is called in Japan. I have conflicting
   reports as to which month it is, but since most people translate this BGM
   as "June Mermaid"...

   Well, this fight will last a bit, but it's still quite easy, considering
   you'll have an almost full-healed party when you arrive. Just keep going
   and take advantage of the DeathBlowers.

   You'll appear in the central chamber of the Shevat palace. At this point,
   Emeralda has become a member of your party.
   Emeralda's initial equipment: Devil Dress, EtherStoneLg, SpeedRing.
   Crescens's initial equipment: Power Magic, Magic Guard, Pilot Shield.
   Engine : S50-6600. Frame: CRES-14000. Armor: Z Alloy60/25.

   There's something really important that you should know: this is one of
   these "points of no return" in RPGs: once you talk to Queen Zephyr and
   tell her you're ready to go to Solaris, quite some time will elapse and
   several things will happen before you return to the world map (if at all,
   mwa ha ha). Therefore, I reccomend you tie up everything you haven't done
   yet, buy everything you need, level up if you want, etc..., then save the
   game in a different slot than your main game and don't overwrite it.
   Kinda like you did in the Floating Continent in FF6.

   Anyhow, when you're ready, head back to the palace and enter Queen
   Zephyr's chamber. Tell her that you are ready to begin the assault on
   Solaris.


              S o l a r i s   W o r k e r   A  r e a

   Items in this area: Work Permit, Aquasol DX.

   Go West until a scene activates near the tube-like thing. Make use of the
   Memory Cube. Exit the tube and a scene will trigger. Explore this zone at
   will. You can hop onto the green elevators and press Cross to activate
   them. The first one (not counting the one you came from) will lead to a
   character and an event will happen when you leave him. The second one
   leads to a sequence. Tell Samson you'll follow him, then exit back out.
   Then next elevator leads to a bit more dialogue, but the one after that
   finally leads to Elly.

   Return to Samson (if you forgot, it's the first elevator before the bend,
   the one leading to 12-3-6). He'll give you a Work Permit (where did he
   get it?) and leave. Exit and talk to the guard in front of the elevator,
   which happens to be Samson (where did he get that uniform?).

   Proceed through the door Northeast. Keep going and you'll find an
   elevator. Ignore it and keep going Northeast until you find another
   elevator. Take this one instead, as it'll save you some walking. Go
   Northeast through the door.

   In this area, not being seen by the probe is the name of the game. If you
   are detected, you'll be sent back to the last room where Samson was, so 
   don't worry too much, though. Go Northwest and Southwest, but keep in mind 
   that the probe sees in all directions, so you need to have a wall between 
   you and it at all times. Intensive use of L1 and R1 to change the camera 
   view is in order.

   Once you're through, use the elevator in here. The first elevator you'll 
   find leads to an Aquasol DX. Keep going and take the second elevator, then 
   cross the door. A scene will trigger. Take the elevator Northeast, then go 
   Northwest. Talk to the people here if you want, then go Northeast.

   Items in this area: Tickets.

   This place is somewhat big so feel free to explore at your leisure. In
   the Northwest wall of this area (you need to cross the bridge) there's a
   superstore of sorts which sells:

   Character Equipment:
   Matchlock             12000
   B&JM10X Ammo             60
   B&JM686XAmmo             80
   ShotG70 Ammo             90
   MatAero Ammo            150
   MatTerraAmmo            150
   MatPyro Ammo            150
   MatHydroAmmo            150
   Crimson Vest           2800
   FeatheredCap           1200

   Get the Matchlock right away and plenty of ammo for it (the ammo, as
   always, is quite cheap). Also, the Crimson Vest and FeatheredCap should
   be better than anything you should have equipped except for Maria, and
   they're cheap too, so get some (I'd say four of each, you never seem to
   run out of money in Xenogears).

   Another clerk in the same building sells:

   Character Items:
   Aquasol S               100
   Aquasol DX              300
   Alphasol               1000
   Rosesol S               300
   Rosesol DX              800
   Sigmasol               1500
   Zetasol                 100
   Physimentsol             50
   White Star              500
   Brown Star              500
   Red Star                500
   Blue Star               500
   Hard Star               800
   Speed Star             1000
   Omegasol                 50
   Survival Tent           150

   Exit the store. From here, go Northeast round the circular section to its
   end. Go South and a guard won't let you pass, triggering an event. Ignore
   the elevator, it just takes you down to the street in which you can't do
   much. Instead, go back to the building with rorating doors in the
   Northeast wall of the circle and enter it (it's like a real rotating
   door, so push the right pane). Enter the door Northwest and you'll find,
   of all people, Big Joe (or at least someone identical to him). He'll
   ignore you though, so go back and take the elevator leading up. Here,
   take the Southeast door. Talk to the lady in red and she'll nicely offer
   her Tickets. Decline them... just kidding. Go back and enter the door
   leading Northwest. There's a Memory Cube here, and a man who'll at the
   very last tell you what the hell are those cubes. Save and go back to the
   guard that didn't let you enter the ceremony.

   Here, you'll meet Kain at last. He will give an speech in which he will
   tell the people that the Gazel have opened "the the door to 'Mahanon'"
   ^_^; You'll also be introduced to one of the most important characters in
   the game, Krelian (Kareruren in the Japanese version). Also, you'll have
   the first of a series of quite revealing flashbacks about Fei's past...
   Anyhow, you'll en up in...

   Run West as fast as possible to avoid fighting the robot cubes. Battle
   details following:

   Battle:
   Security Cube x2
     HP 180, Exp 1500, G 1000. 
     Character-sized. Triangular, slab-like, white and red floating robot.
     Uses "Def UP/Eth Def DOWN". When Raises its defense rating, lowering its
     Ether defense. Will use this at random if not attacked or if attacked
     with a physical attack.
     Uses "Eth Def UP/Def DOWN". Raises its Ether defense rating, lowering
     its defense. Will use this at random if not attacked or if attacked
     with an Ether attack.

   This must go as the worst security mechanism ever. They hit you for 1 HP,
   and they keep announcing defense modes happily for you to know. Pathetic.
   Wait for them to switch to a defense mode and attack them with the
   opposite.

   As for the level itself: go to the South walkway, go through the barrier.
   Switch to the North one, cross another barrier. Leap over the block, drop
   down and taker the red ladder up (I think it's impossible to jump
   directly from the block). Keep going and jumping over more blocks, then
   switch to the South walkway and jump over the step. Now you can either
   go over the cables, or drop down and take the ladder. Keep going and
   evading the columns. Take the South walkway. Go up the step and up the
   ladder. Switch to the North walkway. You can go back through it to get
   the Aquasol DX or not, as you wish. In any case, keep going West. There's
   more cables in here, but this time you have no choice but to cross them,
   as the ladder is in the East wall of the pit. Continue through the South
   walkway, then cross to the North one. If you go back you can get a
   Feathered Cap. Keep going, step and ladder again, cross to the South, and
   finally, take the ladder up to the exit. Phew!

   Approach the big door to the Northwest to trigger a scene. Enter the
   house. After the long sequence, you'll be in Elly's room. Use the Memory
   Cube to save. Explore around if you want (you can even enter the shower),
   then exit it via the door to the Northeast.

   The door in the Northwest wall leads to Elly's father's room. Her mother
   Medena won't let you enter it though.

   The door to the Northeast leads to a room with a maid in it. Talk to her
   and she'll give you the Psycho Rod. I don't think I have to tell you to
   equip it, have I? ^_^;

   The big double door to the Southeast leads to the courtyard, but the
   gate is closed.

   So enter the door to the Southwest and talk to Medena. Then, when she
   leaves the house, enter the room of Elly's father. Check the computer
   over the desk and you'll be treated to one of those "here, let me try the
   first thing that comes to my head as the password... hey, it worked!"
   scenes. Followed by some more cool character development, which leads
   to Elly leaving the party.


        S o l a r i s   2 n d   C l a s s   C i t i z e n   L e v e l

   I bet you forgot Fei doesn't speak a word of Solarian, didn't you? ^_^;
   Anyhow, you remember where the exit of this place was, don't you? That's
   right, Southwest. So go there! A scene will trigger in which Fei suddenly
   understands Solarian... not really.

   After reuniting with Citan, go back all the way to the start. Go down the
   elevator. The next elevator leads to the Aquasol DX you already got, so
   take the next one. Go through the probe zone (which is now most noticeably
   probe-less) and take the first door. Take the elevator and exit Southwest.

   In the familiar worker area, head for the elevator you entered Solaris
   from, the Southeasternmost one. Citan will tell you to head for the dust
   chute, it's the hexagonal thing in the bend of the main hallway. Check
   the green blinking light.

   Army Cardkey, then more scenes will follow.

   If you want to rest and save, you can check the red light in the opposite
   wall to unfold a ladder leading to the main worker area (in which you can
   save where you always do). Otherwise, check the green light again and
   you'll be sucked by the dust chute. You can still go back, though.


               S o l a r i s   D u s t   C h u t e

   Items in this area: Hob-Steak, Aquasol DX.

   Enemies in this area:
   Dorothy
     HP 150 (of a maximum of 300), Exp 17829, G 184. Leaves Rosesol,
     Rosesol DX.
     Character-sized. Same description as Phobia. Blue woman which has fins
     coming out of her dress.
     Dorothy absorbs all damage dealt to her as HP, and is damaged by effects
     that restore HP.
     Uses <No Name>. Causes "Confusion" on all characters.
     Uses "HP 1". Reduces one character to 1 HP.
   Orphan   
     HP 3200, Exp 8829, G 1. Leaves Aquasol, Alphasol.
     Character-sized. Same description as a Rotten Sod. Huge, embryo-like
     mutant.
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs HP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum HP. Orphan uses this both as a regular attack and
     as a counter against physical attacks.
     Uses <No Name>. Absorbs MP on an amount equal to one fifth of a
     character's maximum MP. Orphan uses this both as a regular attack and
     as a counter against physical attacks.
   Security Cube

   Since you'll be fighting Dorothy's and Orphan's quite frequently from now
   on, I better give you some hints about the fastest way to beat them.
   Dorothy's are easy: just cast Sazanami or InnerHealing on them and
   they're gone. Orphans on the other hand can be quite tough. I've found
   that the best way to beat them is to have Citan cast Renki, then Yamiga
   (on all, thanks to Renki). This will raise your attack power a lot, so
   use your best Deathblows to beat him (Citan should deal more than 1000
   damage each turn). The best part is that, though Yamiga lowers your
   defense power, it doesn't matter at all, since Orphan's attacks do damage
   proportionally to your maximum HP (thus defense has no effect at all).

   Go Northwest through the door. Go up the ladders (for some reason, if
   you're running you'll teleport to the top of the first one ^_^;).
   Finally, enter the door Southeast. Here you'll see a large fan in the
   floor: jumping over it while it's spinning isn't a wise idea, as you'll
   be punished with 50 damage for each character in the party (you can,
   however, stand on its axis ^_^ ). You have to push the piece of debris
   that's Southwest of the fan into it, causing it to stop and allowing you
   to continue through it. Beware! however, because you mustn't happily
   throw yourself into it: hug the wall as you fall so you can land on a
   thinner ring, which contains a door to the Northeast (if you fail you'll
   return to the first room in this dungeon).

   Continue Northeast, then Southeast. The hallway Southwest leads to a
   chest with a Hob-Steak. Proceed through the one leading Northeast and
   enter the door. Check the boxes in this room for a comment on Fei's part.
   The chest to the North contains an Aquasol DX. When you try to leave by
   the door Northwest, a scene will take place. Then, cross that door.

   Enemies in this area:

   Orphan   
   Security Cube

   Go up the ladder. Head Northwest and take the chest with a Hob-Steak.
   Cross the door to the Northwest.


                S o l a r i s   C o m p u t e r   R o o m

   Items in this area: Gold Bullion, Gold Nugget.

   There're two computers in this room, one near the door, which gives you
   a code (0101 in my game, I think it's the same always) and another one to
   the Northeast that asks for input.

   What you have to do is to set the bottom line of squares of the screen
   (hereafter "result") to 0101, the code they give you in the other
   computer. 0101 means, obviously, that the second and fouth squares have
   to be lit, and the first and third have to be off. Not only that, but
   there's an extra in the form of two chest that appear if you clear all
   squares and lit all of them. One of these operations yield a Gold Bullion
   and the other a Gold Nugget. But what dictates the results?
   The computer seems to do the logical XOR (exclusive OR) of what it has
   and what you input, which means that the first square in the result would
   be lit if either your first square or the first square on what was there
   before is lit, but not if both or none of them are. Confused? Well, the
   worst part is that this rule doesn't even apply all the times, as the
   behavior of the computer is quite erratic, at best (sometimes it won't
   even turn on/off a square when you select it). Either it's some kind of
   twisted logic that I wasn't able to master, or there's a bug ^_^ that
   causes the upper line to be displayed incorrectly. In any case, and
   assuming the game worked 100% correctly, to clear them all, make it so
   that what you input is equal to what is there; and to set them all, input
   the opposite to what is there. Once you have both chests, make it so that
   the result is 0101.

   Once you deactivate the scanner, you can go through the conveyor belts.

   Items in this area: Hob-Meat, Gold Nugget.

   Enemies in this area:
   Dorothy
   Orphan   
   Security Cube
   Solaris Guard

   Get onto the Southeasternmost conveyor belt and step on the little square
   platform that's a bit Southeast of it (ignore the ladder down, it leads
   nowhere useful). Get the Hob-Meat and go all the way back to the conveyor
   belts. This time hop onto the Northwesternmost one and go Northeast,
   using the walkway when you can go no further. On approaching the door, a
   scene will take place. Continue through the door.

   After the scene, go Southeast, take the Gold Nugget in the chest and
   cross the door Southwest. Save at the Memory Cube. Go Southeast and
   activate the elevator.

   Enemies in this area:
   Dorothy
   Orphan   
   Security Cube
   Solaris Guard

   After the long way up, you'll be in a room with doors to the Southwest,
   Northeast, and up a spiral staircase. Both the Southwest and the
   staircase ones are locked, so take the Northeast one. The Southeast path
   of the next junction leads to a room which has an Aquasol DX and a
   computer; grab one and turn on the other (don't know what this is for
   though, I hoped it would unlock the locked doors, but they're opened
   later). Then keep going Northeast. Another junction (this time Northwest)
   leads to a room filled with Memory Cubes (here's where they are made, we
   can guess), one of which is functional. A chest here contains a Survival
   Tent, and a computer can be used to make some Cubes spin (with no
   apparent result). Return to the main hallway and keep going Northeast:
   the last doorway in this section will lead to an interesting room.

   Here, turn on the switch in the walkway for a scene, then take the
   opposite door. Cross the Southwest door to enter the next section of
   Krelian's lab.


         S o l a r i s   K r e l i a n ' s   L a b   J a i l s

   Items in this area: Hob-Meat, Muscle Belt, Scales, Angelic Robe, Eyeball,
   Hob-Steak.

   You'll find several cages throughout this place, holding what once were
   humans. Inside each cage there will also be chests, and near it, a switch
   to open it. It's up to you whether to open any of them or not.

   First cage:
   Battle:
   Neo Wels x4
     HP 200, Exp 6338, G 125.
     Character-sized. Same description as Wels. Brown mummy-alike.
     Uses <No Name>. Self-destructs, causing about 30 damage to one party
     member (don't be afraid, the 300+ displayed is the damage to HIM ^_^;).
   Chest: Hob-Meat.

   Second cage: (the guy in this cage is the one which had a dog in Nortune's
   rooftops):
   Battle:
   Orphan
   Chest: Muscle Belt.

   Third cage:
   Battle:
   Neo Wels x4
   Chest: Scales.

   The elevator to the Southeast is locked, so take the door leading
   Southwest, then in the next room use the door again. You'll be in another
   cage filled room. From Northeast to Southwest:

   First cage:
   Battle:
   Dorothy
   Chest: Angelic Robe.

   Second cage:
   Battle:
   Neo Wels x4
   Chest: Eyeball.

   Third cage:
   Battle:
   Neo Wels x4
   Chest: Hob-Steak.

   Equip the Angelic Robe on Elly, then proceed Southwest through the door
   (again, the elevator is locked).


               S o l a r i s   K r e l i a n ' s   L a b

   Items in this area: Extra Ar+6, Eyeball, Gold Nugget, Hob-Meat, Aquasol
   DX, Aquasol DX, Survival Tent, Silver Ar+1, Aquasol DX, Ether Veiler,
   DeathBlower 3, Dark Helm, Dark Armor, B&JM686SAmmo, Survival Tent, Extra
   Ar DX, Extra Ar +6, Silver Ar+1, Sonic Wave, Silver Ar+1, Gold Nugget,
   Speed Ring S.

   Enemies in this area:
   Dorothy
   Orphan   
   Security Cube
   Solaris Guard

   In the next room, you can open the purple translucent doors. Go through
   the first one, and enter the first door to the Northwest. Take the Extra
   Ar+6, then leave and enter the next door. Pick up the Eyeball, leave and
   go back to the main hallway. This time cross the other purple door and
   repeat the process to harvest a Gold Nugget and a Hob-Meat. Once back to
   the main hallway, go Northwest, then turn to the right, and take the
   single door to the Southeast. Here grab the Aquasol DX over the table and
   check the computer to deactivate the security system. Go back and
   continue Northeast, then cross the newly-unlocked door.

   It will lead back to the room with the spiral staircase. The door you
   just crossed is one of those that were locked, so go up the staircase and
   open the other. Take the Aquasol DX and the Survival Tent in the chests,
   then keep going.

   The Southwest and Norhteast arms of this cross-shaped room lead to the
   elevators in the jail rooms, so ignore them. Instead, keep going
   Southeast through the doors. In the next room filled with macabre
   experiments, there's a Silver Ar+1 in the Southwest wall, behind the huge
   torso. Keep going Southeast, and Southeast again. In the room with the
   laser-like surgery implements, grab the Aquasol DX in the South corner,
   then take the Southeast door. Here you can save; do so, then return to
   the other room and enter the Northeast door. Here you'll see a jail with
   quite a lot of people. All of them, as boefore, are monsters. You can
   open the jail and some of them will pursue you, while others will ignore
   you. Inside the jail there are an Ether Veiler and a DeathBlower 3. Both
   of these are extremelly useful and rare Gear equipment, so I highly
   suggest you open the cage. Besides, all of these enemies are rather easy
   to beat. Below is a chart of the jail's inhabitants.

   Red cyclops (it's the one that speaks to you. Pursues you).
   Neo Wels x4

   Grayish-blue guy with handkerchiefs around neck and head (pursues you):
   Neo Wels x4

   Brown guy with long ears (pursues you):
   Neo Wels x4

   Orange teddy-bear like guy with cap (ignores you):
   Neo Wels x4

   Blue cyclops (ignores you):
   Neo Wels x4

   Blue fish and lion-like woman (pursues you)
   Dorothy

   Blue guy with tail and some kind of hood (pursues you):
   Battle:
   Orphan

   Green frog-like guy (pursues you):
   Orphan

   Mole-like guy (ignores you):
   Orphan

   Gray cyclops (ignores you):
   Bloody Bros x2
     HP 4242, Exp 25701, G 3000.
     Character-sized. Same description as Redrum. Scary, bony mutant with a
     huge bone claw.
     Uses "Murder/steal all HP". Kills a character by draining all of
     his/her HP.

   All of these fights are pretty easy. Yes, including the Bloody Bros. They
   will use "Murder" on the first round, forcing you to revive two of your
   characters, but from there on they'll just do 1 HP attacks! It's worth
   beating them for the Exp and G, in my opinion, but you decide. In any
   case, go back to the room with the Memory Cube, and this time continue
   Southeast. Keep going Southeast until you can go no further (this
   includes opening a door that doesn't look like a door). Then turn
   Southwest. Follow the winding hallway, and at the next junction turn
   Southwest again.

   In the next room, activate the panels to show... something (angel
   larvae? Or what are these?), as well as play some notes that will be
   important shortly (you can play these by checking the lone panel too).
   Also, get the Dark Helm in the chest to the West.

   Go back and keep going Southeast. Enter the hallway and room to the
   Norhteast. Get the Dark Armor and leave. Keep going Southeast to another
   door. In the next room, get the B&JM686SAmmo. Here, BTW, is a
   representation of something that will be quite important later... Exit
   the room and go back all the way to the starting point (no, not Lahan,
   the first junction in this room, duh!) and this time go Northeast. Again,
   follow the winding hallway to a door. Trying to open the door will prompt
   you to enter a musical code. That's right, it's the one you heard before.
   For the musically challenged, it's up, down, up, left, right.

   In the next junction, go Southwest. Enter the door Northeast and follow
   the green walkway up to a Survival Tent, then keep going up and exit by
   the door. Get the chest to your Northwest with an Extra Ar DX inside,
   then go back and past the door you came from, and enter the second door.
   Go down the walkway and get an Extra Ar +6. Then go back up (don't go
   further down or you'll end up in the room you just were in). Once back
   up, go southeast to enter the third door in this wall. Go down to get a
   Silver Ar+1. As before, go back up and exit to the hallway. Keep going
   Southeast until you see a detour to the Southwest; go along it and
   through the door. Here, you can go down by one side and get a Sonic Wave
   (a whip for Bart). Do the same in the next two junctions (to the
   Northeast and Southeast) to get a Silver Ar+1 and a Gold Nugget. Keep
   going Southeast, then Southwest and enter the detour to the Southeast.
   Here'll be a scene, then you can check any of the holograms to display
   Solaris' data about that character. Oh, and don't forget to get the
   Speed Ring S on your way out. Keep going Southwest and check the door.
   After the sequence, take the Southeast path and open the door. And be
   prepared for the beginning of Xenogear's best part of the plot.

   Your party has been changed to Fei, Bart and Billy. Just keep going
   Southwest. After the sequence, more Southwest. When you can go no
   further, you'll see a (somewhat hidden) door to the Southeast. Here
   you'll find a lot of friends, as well as a Memory Cube and a novelty: a
   blue one, which will allow you to change party members. Also, talking
   to Hammer will allow you to buy items and accesories.

QUICK GEAR RIDE  ________________________________________________________
by Jego Herve  <hjego@hotmail.com>

While in the world map or any area in which you can go around in your 
gears, you can press L2+R2 to get into / out of your gears instantly.
This might not seem like much, but believe me, not having to go to the 
menu screen saves a lot of time.


YGGDRASIL'S REVERSE GEAR  _______________________________________________
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>

While flying around in the Yggdrasil, you can hold R2, then press the action 
button (Circle) to fly backwards. Quite useful for those accurate landings.


IN-GAME MUSIC TEST  _____________________________________________________
by Tatsushi Nakao  <uni@dragonfire.net>

Apart from the music test in Shevat, which lets you listen only to some
themes, there's another one close to the end of the game. If you go to
Kislev's Battling, which is still operative, you can choose to fight against
other Gears for Battle Points. The Battling will be explained in a later
version of the FAQ, but you can use David Johnson's walkthough for details
about it.
Anyway, one of the items you can exchange for battle points is a M Disk,
which lets you hear most of the game's BGM in the jukebox in the same
Battling. I've listed the BGMs along with the Action Replay number
corresponding to them.
BTW, you can use my Infinite Battle Points Action Replay code to get the
M Disk easily. Unfortunatelly, it seems that using the AR to get the disc
itself won't work, though. (note: this code will be released when I get that
far into the game).
Also, it seems that you can't only play BGMs that have already been played
throughout the game, but since when you reach there you'll have listened
to most of it, that's not much problem.
I'm not using the official American translations for the tracks' names but
rather a mix of these and the direct translations of the Japanese taken from
Soundtrack Central.
A couple of additional notes. First, BGM titles in < > have no official
names and are thus from me. And second, for each track, I'm also including
it's corresponding Action Replay code number and track order in the
XenoGears Soundtrack CDs, as shown below:

  n/a   - n/a -  2/19 - Small Two of Pieces - Restored Shards

"Awakening" and "One who Bares Fangs at God" are the BGMs for the last two
bosses, so you couldn't have heard these before playing the M Disc (a real
pity, because both are excellent). Stars of Tears was cut out from the game
itself (check the Miscellaneous section for more info). As for the other
three, they belong to FMVs so they can't be played separatedly.

Please don't reprint these codes without attributing them to their proper
authors/creators.
Also, please don't ask me how to use any of these codes. I've put them as
clearly as I've been able (not that much, I know).

These codes were created and tested using a Comms Kit. This device allows
you to enter codes instantly into the game, as opposed to a regular Action
Replay or Game Shark which enters the code from the beginning. If you have
any problems with these codes, try turning off the Action Replay / Game
Shark right after entering the codes, then turning it on just before you
need them (for example, only turn on codes that should be used in a battle
if you are in a battle).

ITEM SELECT                                               8006F65A - xxyy
by Ignacio de Lucas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the times you'll be using this code to just get a Debug Item and
Debug Skill: these items give you almost all items and techniques in the
game! (and even some that aren't in there). BTW, using the Debug Item
generates Debug Skill, so you don't even need that one. The Debug Item
won't give any of the Event Items, though.

The Debug Skill will also put all characters in the "global party", just
as if the "party select" code had been used with 07FF (see below). This
is bad, however: it will cause the game to freeze when shopping, since
it will try to display the faces of all characters on the shopping screen.
So correct it with a Party Select code.

The Debug Item and Debug Skill have the numbers 21 and 22.

xx = Item in first slot, right side.
yy = Item in first slot, left side.

Item numbers will be mapped in a future revision.

INFINITE MONEY                                             8006EF58  C9FF

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone asked me in the Japanese version why I hadn't made this code. There
are two reasons: I could say that I don't usually use AR codes to make the
game easier, preferring instead the ones that have interesting effects. But
the main reason is that I forgot ^_^;

At last, this much-anticipated code. It will give you massive amounts of
both Current and Total BPs, enjoy.

FAST LEVEL UP - FEI                                        8006D8E4  0001  
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>                  8006D8E6  0000  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this one made you gain a level each battle. I haven't made any
more of these (just Fei's) or tested it further because of the above
reason of making the game easier.

FEI ALWAYS RUNS                                            8005A0FC  0040
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful for lazy players (like me! ^_^;) who don't want to even hold X
to run around. The code doesn't have any side effect either (i.e. the 
X button works just fine).

Apparently, the game uses different addresses each time to store your
character's position in the world map. None of those two codes will work
all the time. I'll try to look further into this matter whenever I have a
little more time...

by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inspired by the code of the same name someone made for FF7 (I later made
that same for the US version of FF7). Like it says, the game always
considers you to be on a Memory Cube. The most amazing bit about this code
is that it actually works, that is, you can load the saved game and you
will appear where you saved. It will mess up in some places, however:
one of them being the Babel Tower. So I'd reccomend you always keep at
least one "traditional" save game (i.e. don't overwrite it using this 
code).

I've also had some problems with this code, specifically being unable
to boot the game with it active. Until I check it some more, I'd reccomend
you turned off the Action Replay as soon as you enter the code, and turned
it on only when saving.

I've finally reached Shevat's music player so I've been able to make this
code. You need to enter or exit a place which changes music in order to
start playing the selected BGM. Also, the music of the place you use will
affect the quality of the BGM when played: in some places you will only get
quite unpleasant noise for all BGMs. If that happens try another place.

Also, for all BGMs I've put their order number when played in the Battling
jukebox and the order in XenoGear's Soundtrack CDs.

PARTY SELECT                                               8006F364  0xyz
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>                  8006F366  FFFF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of my favorite codes, it allows you to freely configurate the members
of your "global" party, i.e. the members in your current party and those 
in the reserve. You can then change party members normally as often as 
you want.

Keep in mind that there are only 9 members slots at any time (three in your
current party and six in the reserve) and there are 11 characters, so if you
choose all of them, Citan with Katana and adult Emeralda will not show up.
What's worse, if you choose all characters, the game will slow down to a
halt whenever you enter a shop's menu, as the game will try to display all
characters' faces at once. So in sum, do NOT choose more than 9 characters

Note also that the Debug Skill item will configure your party as having all
characters, so this problem will also arise. Fortunatelly, you can use this
code (party select) to select a 9-character party (or less, if you want).

In other words, you must leave two characters out. During a normal game,
these are obviously regular Citan when he gets a Katana, and young
Emeralda when she grows up. I sort of liked ol' good Citan though (more than
Chu Chu anyway ^_^;).

The way of calculating the number that you have to put instead of the xyz
can be tricky if you don't know hexadecimal / binary. I'll try to make it
simple though.

The "x" controls whether Maria, Citan with Katana and adult Emeralda
are in your global party.

            Maria   Citan   Emeralda 
         0  No      No      No
         1  Yes     No      No
         2  No      Yes     No

         6  No      Yes     Yes
         7  Yes     Yes     Yes

The "y" controls whether Billy, Rico, young Emeralda and Chu Chu are in 
your global party.         
         
            Billy   Rico    Emeralda Chu Chu
         0  No      No      No       No
         1  Yes     No      No       No
         2  No      Yes     No       No
         3  Yes     Yes     No       No
         4  No      No      Yes      No

         7  Yes     Yes     Yes      No
         8  No      No      No       Yes
         9  Yes     No      No       Yes

         E  No      Yes     Yes      Yes
         F  Yes     Yes     Yes      Yes

The "z" controls whether Fei, Elly, Citan and Bart are in your global
party.

            Fei     Elly    Citan   Bart
         0  No      No      No      No
         1  Yes     No      No      No
         2  No      Yes     No      No
         3  Yes     Yes     No      No
         4  No      No      Yes     No
         5  Yes     No      Yes     No
         6  No      Yes     Yes     No
         7  Yes     Yes     Yes     No
         8  No      No      No      Yes
         9  Yes     No      No      Yes
         A  No      Yes     No      Yes
         B  Yes     Yes     No      Yes
         C  No      No      Yes     Yes
         D  Yes     No      Yes     Yes
         E  No      Yes     Yes     Yes
         F  Yes     Yes     Yes     Yes


Some interesting parties are:

07BB : Citan with Katana, adult Emeralda, Maria and Chu-chu (my fave).
077B : Citan with Katana, both Emeraldas, Maria but not Chu-chu.
073F : Both Citans, adult Emeralda, Maria but not Chu-chu.
067F : Both Citans, both Emeraldas, but without Maria nor Chu-chu.

In all of these all of the other party members (Fei, Elly, Bart, Rico and
Billy) are also included. However there's lots of combinations and with
a little thinking you can make your favorite.

Additionally, I've received a mail asking me how to REMOVE characters from
your party. Well, it's just as simple as forming a party that doesn't
include them.

CHARACTER SELECT                                           3006F368  00xx
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>                  3006F369  00yy
                                                           3006F36A  00zz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually, the only reason now to use this code, is to change characters
when you still can't change characters (early on the game). You will
therefore always use this code in conjunction with the former one, since
when you can't change characters is when you have only three or less in your
global party, so you wouldn't be able to select anyone anyway. So you'd use
the "Party Select" to put the character you want in your global party, then
the "Character Select" to put it into your current party. Clear enough? I
hope so, because that's about as clearly as I can put it.

Beware when selecting a character that you haven't already obtained
normally, as most of the times they won't be equipped with a Gear, or even
be equipped, as in adult Emeralda's case, with the Yggdra4, which tends to
crash the game. For these, remember to use a "Gear select" code (which, of
course, I kindly provide :) ).

In these, xx is the first character, yy the second, and zz the third. If you
are using a Comms Kit to activate these, remember you can't enter codes
starting with 30 with it; instead, you must use:

8006F368  yyxx
8006F36A  00zz


The character numbers are:

00 - Fei
01 - Elly
02 - Citan
03 - Bart
04 - Billy
05 - Rico
06 - Young Emeralda
07 - Chu-chu
08 - Maria
09 - Katana-wielding Citan 
0A - Adult Emeralda

Well, I made this code mainly for being able to make the skill lists 
without the enemies dying all around, but maybe someone might find 
this useful.

Silly me, I forgot that the above code could be as well used to put the
enemies down to 1 HP. And THAT would be useful ^_^;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like it says. Beware that this causes EXTREMELLY weird things to happen when
inside your Gear: namely, you will use your character's Skills instead of
the Gear's!  It will use the animations for your Gear's attacks but it looks
really cool! The "beware" part is that it tends to crash the game.

INFINITE HP / EP
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each character, there are four codes listed. They are HP, Max HP, EP and
Max EP. One note though: some of these will not work, especially for the
later characters. It seems that they're not always equally distanced, and
I've not bothered to try them all. Most should work, though.

Beware that if your character doesn't have an Infinity Level attack he/she

0F : Xenogears
10 : Heimdal
11 : Bart 01 (crashes)
12 : Yggdra (crashes)

Gears marked with (crash) tend to crash the game (surprise). They can still
be used in battle and they won't crash much (well the Yggdra does a bit
^_^;), but they will definitelly crash if their graphic is to be displayed
in the map. I.e. don't enter or exit any location with any of them active
(I'm afraid exiting from a battle counts as well, though).

HAVE ALL ABILITIES
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice, huh? Each one of the five codes for each character gives all abilities
of a certain type for that character. These are: Skills, Ethers, Gear
Skills, Gear Ethers, and Gear Options, in that order. Actually, you might
just as well use the Debug Skill item to get all abilities, but keep in mind
that the Debug Skill doesn't give you all abilities (for example, Fei's
"Hell Fire" Gear option). If you use Debug Skill and don't get all Gear
Skills, use the third code for each character, which is the one which gives
Gear Skills.

These codes will also give you tons of non-existing abilities though,
which can make anything from crash the game to nothing at all. To make 
sure one of these exists, just check it in the official lists.

HAVE WON FOUR STRAIGHT RPS GAMES                           800C3E7A  0004
by Ignacio de Lucas  <de_lucas@yahoo.com>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who just can't beat that darned guy at Rock, Paper,
Scissor in Lahan, here's the right code. This will make the game think
you've won four times in a row, so you just have to win a fifth time and
he'll give you the RPS Badge (remember you have to talk to him after you
win). Even if you lose, the game still thinks you've won four times, so
just try again. Easy.

(Sigh) They changed the button layout in the US version. It's a mess to
make out at first, especially when I go back to play any other RPG game in
which Triangle goes to the menu screen, as usual. If you played the Japanese
version (or FF7), Square and Triangle are switched as are Cross and Circle.
Of course, the notations in ths FAQ correspond to the US version, don't
worry.

Skill Menu   = This screen shows you all the skills you can learn at the
               moment.  If you've learned a skill, the Ability Points
               (AP) required are shown along with the button command.
               (For instance, Fei's Senretsu costs 5 AP and is inputted as 
               T,T,X).

               The numbers and bars tell you how close you are to learning
               a new skill. If it's at 100% and you haven't learned it yet,
               it means that your level is still too low to get it, but 
               you'll learn it automatically once you reach the appropriate 
               level.

Ability Menu = See 'Main Menu: Ability'
Equip Menu   = See 'Main Menu: Equip'


MAIN MENU - EQUIP  ______________________________________________________

The box in the upper left shows this:

Weapon   (currently equipped)
Accessories  (currently worn)

Accessories include armor (hats, clothing), and items similar to those
found in FF7 (Stamina Ring, Glasses, etc.). You can only wear one armor-type
accesory at a time, and the same applies to headwear-type ones.

The box in the upper right shows what unequipped items can be worn.

The box in the lower right shows the same stats from the 'Status'
screen.  When you equip an item, the positive (red) or negative (blue)
impact on certain stats is displayed.

                   Billy's Equipment Screen

Of special mention is Billy's Equip menu. Since he uses fireguns as his
primary weapons, he must equip ammo in order to attack. By pressing Right
on the control pad when you are in his Equip menu, you'll have access to
a sub-screen in which you can select the type of ammo for each of his four
guns: the Handgun, the two Ether Guns (left and Right) and the Shotgun.

Ammo for the Ether Guns is unlimited, but the others come in clips of 100
bullets a piece. Unfortunatelly, the only way to see which ammo is left on
the equipped clips is during a battle (it will be displayed when you
select Attack).

Also, if Billy has exactly 100 bullets in the currently equipped clip, the
clip will be stored in the item list if you change ammo (as usual), but
if there are 99 or less bullets in it, ALL of them will be lost once you
change! So don't change ammo unless you are full (you didn't shot the
current clip) or you don't have much left and you have to reload.


MAIN MENU - ITEM  _______________________________________________________

The main box shows all the items you've accquired so far.  Items that
are highlighted can be used currently; items in dark lettering cannot
be used at the moment.  The lower box will give you a description of
the item, as well as tell you what type of item it is.

You can sort items by pressing X over an item once, finding a place,
and pressing X.  In the case of highlighting another item, the two will
switch places.  To use an item, double-select that item with X and then
choose the applicable character(s).


MAIN MENU - ABILITY  ____________________________________________________

The main box shows all learned abilities, and how many Ether Points (EP)
are required to use that ability.  The box in the lower left gives a
brief description of that ability, and the box to the lower right tells
you what type of ability it is.  Finally, a small box below that shows
you your current / maximum EP count.


MAIN MENU - GEAR  _______________________________________________________

This menu isn't available unless you have a Gear and are using it outside
of a battle.

The menu is similar to the Status screen, but with some differences:

FL = Current amount of Gear fuel / Maximum amount of fuel



Characteristic     Determines
Weight             Affects Agility
Attack             Damage inflicted with physical attacks
Defense            Damage received from physical attacks
Ether Defense      Damage received from Ether attacks
Response           Chance of hitting with physical attacks
Agility            Time between turns
Ether Amplifier    Damage inflicted with Ether attacks



The 'Weapon' and 'Accessory' sections on this screen apply to your Gear,
not you :)  As for the other options:

Get ON/OFF  = Choose if you want to walk or ride in your Gear.
Gear Option = Devices that can be used by your gear. They cost fuel.
Ability     = These are Abilities that you can use while in your Gear 
              They also cost EP.  
Equip       = For equipping weapons and accessories on your Gear.


MAIN MENU - FILE  _______________________________________________________

When selected, this screen loads up all the files on your Memory Card(s),
including the little animated pictures.  Nice.

If you're standing near a Memory Cube or are on the Field, you can choose
to save your game.  Otherwise, your only option are to copy an existing
file or delete a file.  Note that you can copy and delete non-Xenogears
files as well :)


MAIN MENU - EXIT  _______________________________________________________

As opposed to pressing Circle, you can also choose this option to exit the
Main Menu.

Sleeping in an inn restores all HP and EP, pretty much as always.

Like inns, shops can be found everywhere.  Sometimes, you can buy things
from just people standing around instead of people inside buildings.
When the shopping menu pops up, you'll see a list of items for sale and
the amount of gold they cost will be displayed on the right.  The window
on the top tells you more about the item.  To buy an item, press left or
right while on it to indicate how many of that item you want.  Then
press X to buy it.  A subtraction table on the right will show you how
much gold you have remaining.  When buying an equippable item, portraits
of your characters will be shown, and if that item can be used by that
character, their portrait lights up.  Below that are indicators letting
you know how that item affects your Weapon Power (top) and Defense
Power (bottom).

You can also sell items in shops; just choose items you want to get rid
of and the price offered will be shown.  Not all items are salable.

You can also buy items for your Gear and maintain or upgrade it.  Not
a lot of people can do this for you (Old Man Bal is one of them).  On
that menu:

TUNE UP MENU  ___________________________________________________________

Here, you can improve your Gear's stats:

Fuel   - Restores your lost fuel.  Increases fuel and HP to maximum.
Engine - You can purchase a new engine. This affects the Gear's attack
          power (first number in the engine's name), as well as the 
          amount of fuel it can carry (second number multiplied by 100).
          Unfortunatelly, more powerful engines use fuel faster when
          using Booster.
Frame  - You can purchase a new frame. The Frame of your Gear affects 
          the amount of HP it has. The HP a frame has can be obtained 
          by multiplying the number in its name by 100.
Armor  - You can purchase new armor (for better defense). If there are
          two numbers in its name, the first is the Defense value and the
          second the Ether Defense value.

BUY MENU  _______________________________________________________________

You can buy Weapons or Accessories (Parts) for your Gear.

SELL MENU  ______________________________________________________________

You can sell Weapons or Accessories (Parts).

The battle system in Xenogears is quite similar to that of so many other
Square games (especially FF games), the ATB (Active Time Battle) system.
This system consists of a separate time bar for each character and enemy,
which fill simultaneously as time goes on. When one character's bar is full,
he/she may choose an action to perform, then wait until it fills again.

The system in Xenogears is the "immediate fill" variant, as in Final Fantasy
Tactics. That means that, instead of the bars actually filling up slowly as
real time passes, the game will skip straight to the next character's turn,
and consequently filling up the other characters' bars too according to the
time ellapsed and their speed. Also like in Final Fantasy Tactics, you have
all the time in the world to pick your choices, as the other characters'
bars don't fill up while making selections. To sum it up, there's no
real-time factor, thus making strategy a heavier component of battles.

OK, if you didn't understand, you will once you fight a couple of battles,
if you pay a little attention to the bars. It's a lot simpler than it
sounds.


THE BATTLE SCREEN  (Character Battle)  __________________________________

Shown on the top are the portraits of your characters and their current
and maximum HP.  Below that is shown their Time Bar and amount of
stored Attack Points (AP).

Your character(s) and the enemy or enemies are shown in the middle against
an appropriate background.  Depending on the location and progression of
the battle, both enemies and characters may move to different spots on the
screen.  When you're selecting a target for commands and attacks, a red
arrow appears that you can direct over an enemy or friend with the
directional key.  If you have multiple targets, multiple arrows will show,
with darkened directions indicating that you can press in that direction to
highlight a new target.

When one of your character's time bar it's full, a ring-shaped menu will
appear. This is quite similar to that option of FF5 and FF6 in which you
could arrange the commands in a cross shape, so you could highlight any of
them with one directional press. Only thing is, there are more than four
commands this time, which means there is another ring that can be accessed
by pressing a direction again when you are already highlighting that
direction's command. To select any command, press Cross.

Below that is a tall vertical meter.  This is the graphical representation
of your currently usable Attack Points.  When you're creating your own
chain of attacks, a small numerical counter is also shown to the right of
that showing current AP / maximum AP usable at the moment.  Certain attacks
and combinations require more AP than others (we'll get to all that in a
moment).


BATTLE COMMANDS  (Character Battle)  ____________________________________


      Main Ring:                            Secondary Ring:

     < ABILITY >                               CALL GEAR

DEFENSE        ATTACK                    ESCAPE         COMBO

        ITEM                                      ITEM



                          A T T A C K

 - The basis for Xenogears' battle system is combining three different
   types of attacks to perform a string during each character's turn. The
   attacks are performed by pressing the Triangle, Square and Cross buttons.
   The player has (almost) full freedom to combine these three attacks in
   any way he/she desires.

 - Once you select the "Attack" command, your character will run next to
   the nearest enemy and wait for you to input further commands. At this
   point, you can:

   Press Circle to cancel and go back to the Ring Menu.

   Or press any direction in the D-pad to select another target, if
   available, as mentioned above. 

   Or press any of the attack buttons to start attacking the enemy.
   The attack buttons are the Triangle button (Weak Attack), the Square
   button (Medium Attack) and the Cross button (Strong Attack). Performing
   an attack will immediatelly deduce its cost from your remaining AP for
   that turn, this cost being 1 AP for the Weak Attack, 2 for the Medium
   and 3 for the Strong.

 - However, as mentione above, one of the most notable differences between
   Xenogears and other RPGs is that you can perform more that one attack
   per turn. Assuming you still have enough AP to perform another attack,
   you may do so, and keep attacking until you run out of AP or some other
   circumstance prevent you from doing so. These circumstances include:

   If you perform a Skill (which will be explained later), the string will
   finish immediatly.

   If you pause after an attack, and the enemy has 0 HP, it will die, thus
   ending the string (what, you wanna punch the air?). Note however that
   if you enter all attacks in a quick succesion the enemy won't die until
   you end the string.

   Finally, if you press Circle instead of an attack button, you'll end
   the string prematurelly.

   In any of these three cases, your turn will be over and any remaining
   AP you might still have will be stored in your Combo Bar. The use of
   this bar is discussed under the "Combo" command description.

                              Skills

 - Skills are specific button combinations that result in the final attack
   in the string, which is always a Cross (strong) attack, resulting a
   graphically impressive special attack that will cause much more damage
   than the regular Cross attack would have. Needless to say, they should
   be performed as often as possible, as they have no drawbacks.

   In addition of showing all Skills available to each of your characters
   when you select the Skill option in the Status screen, the game also
   displays, during battle, which Skills are available to you within a
   two button presses range from your current input. Say, with Fei you
   do "Triangle, Triangle". Assuming you don't kill the enemy, the game
   will pause and display the "Cross" ender (so the complete string, from
   the beginning, would be T,T,X) and the "Square, Cross" ender (T,T,S,X),
   but not the "Triangle, Triangle, Cross" one (T,T,T,T,X), as it is three
   button presses away.

 - Skills you haven't yet, but can be learnt (this usually means you have
   enough AP to perform them) are usually displayed grayed out in the Skill
   list, along with a percentage indicator. This percentage will go up
   faster depending on which strings you use during battle. Although it
   seems that performing the string that would result in the Skill you want
   to learn does raise this percentage, sometimes it seems to get stuck and
   other strings are needed. The exact relationship between strings used
   and Skill learning is largely unknown at the moment, unfortunatelly.

 - In any case, having a 100 in a Skill's indicator doesn't neccesarily
   imply the learning of the Skill, since there's also a minimum level
   requirement. However, if you have 100 per cent, you'll automatically
   learn the Skill when you reach that level.


                         A B I L I T Y

   Pretty similar to other game's Magic, each character can learn different
   Abilities as they level up, and use them in battle (and sometimes outside
   it, such as in the case of healing ones). These abilities consume Ether
   points, that can be replenishing either by sleeping or consuming certain
   items (mostly Rosesols). Each character's Ability command receives a
   different name: Ether, Chi, Arcane, Controls or Spells. Refer to the
   Ability lists for details on individual Abilities.


                         D E F E N S E

 - A defending character does not perform any action this turn, but his/her
   Defense Power will be effectivelly doubled until his/her next turn. This
   is mostly useful as a way of not doing anything.


                           I T E M

 - Use one of your items during battle. Note that there are quite some
   items that can't be used during battle (food, for example). BTW, both
   Item commands (the one in the Main Ring and the one in the Secondary
   Ring) are identical.


                           C O M B O

 - You can store up to 28 AP points total. You can then use the Combo
   option to release the stored APs in the form of a string of Skills,
   each one costing as much as the whole string you have to perform normally
   to use it (even though you are actually performing only the "Cross"
   ender each time). Still, this results in dealing huge amounts of damage
   as the Skills are by far the most damaging parts of the strings, and
   look like you're trashing your enemy (the Skills will be performed in
   Fast Forward).
   Skills susceptible to form part of a Combo include all Skills your
   character has learned, excluding any 7 AP Skill.


                        C A L L   G E A R

 - This command allows your character to get inside his/her corresponding
   Gear, assuming that he/she does have one, and that you are in open space
   or in a wide enough place. The advantages to this are immediate, as
   Gears' Attack and Defense Power are obviously unmatched by humans, not
   to mention they have a lot more HP too. Unless you're fighting weak
   enemies for your Level, you'll most likely get trashed by Gears if you
   go on foot, and converselly you'll trash any character-sized enemy if
   you're in your Gears.

 - Disadvantages? There are two. The first one reflects the unavailability
   of Gear resources, as both their Fuel and HP can only be restored in
   certain places (you can use Fuel to heal HP if you're equipped with the
   appropriate Gear part, but...). Humans' HP, on the other side, can be
   easily restored by quite some items, Ethers, etc...
   The secong, and subtler, disadvantage, is that you can't learn Skills
   while on a Gear. This will be explained later.


                          E S C A P E

 - Your character will try to run away from battle. If he/she is successful,
   everyone will flee. However, if he fails, any other character may try
   again during his/her turn.



THE BATTLE SCREEN  (Gear Battle)  _______________________________________

This screen is similar to the normal battle screen, with the following
differences:

 - Shown below the Time Gauge is the Fuel Meter.  Fuel is used in lieu
   of AP while in a Gear.  Without Fuel, you cannot perform commands in
   battle.

 - The graphical and numerical representation of AP now represents
   your amount of Fuel.

 - There is a box to the right showing the status of your Gear.

 - There's an Attack Level icon available.  


BATTLE COMMANDS  (Gear Battle)  _________________________________________



      Main Ring:                            Secondary Ring:

    ETHER MACHINE                           SPECIAL OPTIONS

CHARGE         ATTACK                    ESCAPE         BOOSTER

        ITEM                                     ITEM



                        A T T A C K

 - A Gear is noticeably heavier and slower than a human, and therefore its
   attacking speed is more limited. This means that a Gear may only be able
   to perform either a single attack or a Skill each turn. Furthermore,
   Gear Skills are significantly different from character ones. For one,
   they don't have to end in a Strong (Cross) attack. Also, the string
   which forms a Skill is only two attacks long (the second being the
   Skill). Consequently, ALL strings are Skills. However, Gear Skills
   can't be performed at any time, like character ones: you need a high
   enough Attack Level.

 - Every time you attack, but not perform a Skill, you gain a level in
   your Attack Level meter. Skills starting with Triangle require and
   consume one Attack Level, ones starting with Square cost two, and ones
   starting with Cross cost three. This means that you have to attack
   three turns and not perform a Skill to be able to do a Cross-starting
   Skill. Also, as mentioned above, the amount of Fuel recovered with
   Charge is multiplied by one plus your Attack Level.

 - Like character Skills, if you press a button and can perform a Skill
   off of that button, a diagram showing you the total Fuel Cost as well
   as what button can be pressed to perform that Skill is shown. Of course,
   you can always press Circle to cancel and just do a normal attack (useful
   for building up Attack Level). 

 - Gear Skills are closely related to character ones, in the sense that
   learning one character Skill makes you learn one Gear Skill (at least
   until your third 7 AP character Skill). Since you can only learn
   character Skills on foot, it comes to happen that you need to be on
   foot even to learn Gear Skills!

 - In addition to the Skills you can learn normally (T,T, T,S, S,T,
   S,S, X,T and X,S), there are three accesories that allow you to use
   one additional Skill per level (T,X, S,X and X,X respectively).
   These Skills are extremelly useful as not only do they more damage
   than a regular Skill, but they also cost much less fuel. Thanks
   to David Johnson (johnsonr@compuserve.com) for this info.

                     Infinite Attack Level

 - Of special mention is the Infinite Attack Level.  For a start, it
   isn't achieved normally (i.e.  you don't automatically enter it
   when using a single attack from Level 3).  Instead, each turn you
   SPEND in Level 3, there is a chance of you getting to Level
   Infinite.  This chance is shown as the Hyper Level in the bunch of
   indicators at the right.  So if it says Hyper Level 30%, each turn
   you spend in Attack Level 3 (not counting the one you reach it)
   you have a 30% chance of getting to Attack Level Infinite. And
   note that you don't have to attack or do anything else to raise to
   Infinite Level: you could as well charge fuel while you wait.

 - Now, where does this chance come from? Well, while some Gears seem to
   have an initial Hyper Level value higher to 0%, generally speaking it
   seems to be solely affected by your current HP level.  The least HP you
   have, the greater this chance is.  Keep in mind, though, that even at
   almost 0 HP, this chance doesn't seem to raise above 45% or so.  Also,
   the Weltall 2 has a Gear option that puts it automatically in Infinite
   Level, and the Xenogears is always at 99% Hyper Level. This makes the
   Xenogears the most powerful Gear in the game, since it can reach Infinite
   Attack Level in four turns every time and let hell break loose.

 - Infinite Attack Level wears of after three turns, so you better
   make the most of it. What are your options when in Infinite Attack
   Level?  For a start, you can use Infinite Level Gear Skills, which
   deal a huge amount of damage (about twice as much as a Level 3 Skill)
   for a mere 10, 20 or 30 fuel. Since these won't wear your attack
   level, you can just use them three times in a row (until Infinite 
   Level wears off). You can also charge, and will get ten times as much
   fuel as normal each time. This usually means 300 fuel, but equipping
   an A, S, X or Z charger will get you 500, 1000, 2000 or a whopping
   5000 fuel back!

 - Note also that you can't reach Attack Level Infinite until you have at
   least one Infinite Level Skill. I'm pretty sure that these correspond
   (as seen above) to the 7 AP Skills of the Gear's pilot.


                    E T H E R   M A C H I N E

 - This allows you to use your character's Abilities when inside his/her
   Gear. Not all of a character's Abilities are available when inside a
   Gear, though. Also, some Abilities function and look different when
   you're riding a Gear. For one, all "HP recover" Abilities restore Gear
   defense when used inside a Gear (there are quite some enemy attacks
   that lower defense: this will be reflected in the Armor Loss percentage
   indicator).

 - The only exception to this rule is Chu-chu's "Forest Dance S", which
   recovers not only characters' HPs, but even Gears', making it 
   extremely useful as it is the only way to recover a Gear's HP without
   using Fuel in the whole game.


                         C H A R G E

 - This is the only way of restoring Fuel during battle. The amount of Fuel
   restored is 30 by default, but certain Gear parts, the A, S, X, and Z
   Chargers increase that amount to 50, 100, 200 and 500 respectivelly.
   Also, the amount of fuel recovered varies depending on which Attack Level
   you Gear is in as well. Thanks a lot to Brian Youn (bwa@us.ibm.com) for
   pointing out my wrong assumption of that Levels 1, 2 and 3 multiplied the
   basic amount recovered as Level Infinite did. Rather, they just add 20,
   40 and 60 to this basic amount.


   Level   Recover    Basic   A Charger   S Charger   X Charger   Z Charger
     0                 30         50         100         200         500
     1       +20       50         70         120         220         520
     2       +40       70         90         140         240         540
     3       +60       90        110         160         260         560
 Infinite    x10      300        500        1000        2000        5000

   Finally, equipping the Cleaner will allow you to remove all status
   ailments when charging.

 - It has the same effect that the character command of the same name.


                        B O O S T E R

 - Activating or deactivating the Booster will take you a full turn.
   When the Booster is active, your Gear will consume Fuel each turn,
   but it's Speed will dramatically improve as well, resulting in almost
   twice as many actions performed as before.


                S P E C I A L   O P T I O N S

 - Some Gears receive special devices during the course of the game which
   cost Fuel to activate. Most of the times they are awarded as the story
   progresses, but there are some Gear parts that allow you to restore your
   Gear's HP via one of these commands. These are the Frame HP XX, where
   XX is the percentage of the Gear's HP restored. Of special interest is
   the fact that, while if they are activated in battle they will restore
   the nominal amount of HP, if they are used in the menu screen they will
   only heal a fraction of that percentage, costing much less Fuel as well.
   This is in order to allow you to fine-tune the amount of HP restored.

CHARACTER STATUS EFFECTS  _______________________________________________


  Physical status effects

Stop                 Time bar stops filling. Character can't perform any
                       action until this status is removed
Defense Down         Defense rating is lowered. Character takes more damage
                       from physical attacks
Attack Down          Attack rating is lowered. Character causes less damage
                       with physical attacks
Blindness            Accuracy and Evade ratings are lowered. Character
                       misses more often and evades physical attacks less
                       often.
Slow                 Time bar fills slower, as if Agility had been lowered
Poison               Character's HP decrease steadily


  Mental status effects

Confusion            Character becomes uncontrollable and attacks randomly
                     Not too worrying since he/she will only use single
                     regular attacks or Abilities
Forget               Character can't use Abilities
Sleep                Time bar stops filling until woken up by an attack



GEAR STATUS EFFECTS  ____________________________________________________

Armor Damage         Defense rating is lowered until end of battle or until
                     healed with an Ability (most HP-healing abilities
                     recover Armor Damage instead when used inside a Gear)
Stop                 Time bar stops filling
Slow                 Time bar fills slower, as if Agility had been lowered
Power Loss           Attack rating is lowered
Fuel Leak            Character's Gear loses fuel at a steady rate
Camera Damaged       Both Accuracy and Evade ratings are lowered
Ether Machine        Character loses EP at a steady rate
  Out Of Control
Ether Machine        Character can't use Abilities
  Shutdown
Pilot Confused       Character becomes uncontrollable and attacks randomly



EQUIVALENCES  ___________________________________________________________

As you might have noticed, there's a parallelism between character status
effects and Gear status effects. Their equivalences are as follows:


Gear status                         Character status
-----------                         ----------------
Armor Damage                        Defense Down
Stop                                Stop 
Slow                                Slow
Power Loss                          Attack Down
Fuel Leak                           <No Equivalent> 
Camera Damaged                      Blindness
Ether Machine Out of Control        <No Equivalent>
<No Equivalent>                     Poison
Ether Machine Shutdown              Forget
Pilot Confused                      Confusion
<No Equivalent>                     Sleep

SMALL TWO OF PIECES LYRICS  _____________________________________________


If you have finished Xenogears, you'll have had the extreme pleasure of
listening to "Small Two of Pieces", the staff roll theme which is one of the
best songs I've had the joy to listen to (it's an arrange of the Music Box
theme, which I also love). Well, in case you'd like to have its lyrics
handy, Tomo has been so nice as to let me include here the lyrics for this
song, which I got from his page. BTW, I take advantage of this occasion to
advise you to check it out: it has the lyrics for the entire Xenogears album
and the "Creid" arranged album among a lot others, and it's a really nice
page too. It's URL is:

     <http://members.aol.com/tomo1657/music/index.htm>



            Xenogears Ending Theme
            "Small Two of Pieces"


Run through the cold of the night 
As passion burns in your heart 
Ready to fight, a knife held close by your side
Like a proud wolf alone in the dark 
With eyes that watch the world 
And my name like a shadow on the face of the moon 

Broken mirror, a million shades of light
The old echo fades away
But just you and I
Can find the answer. And then,
We can run to the end of the world
We can run to the end of the world 


Cold fire clenched to my heart
In the blue of night
Torn by this pain, I paint your name in sound 
And the girl of the dawn
With eyes of blue, and angel wings 
The songs of the season are her only crown 

Broken mirror, a million shades of light
The old echo fades away
But just you and I
Can find the answer. And then,
We can run to the end of the world
We can run to the end of the world 


We met in the mist of morning 
And parted deep in the night
Broken sword and shield, and tears that never fall 
But run through the heart 
Washed away by the darkest water 
The world is peaceful and still

Broken mirror, a million shades of light
The old echo fades away
But just you and I
Can find the answer. And then,
We can run to the end of the world
We can run to the end of the world
Run to the end of the world...




And now that we're into soundtracks, I'd reccomend you to check the "Creid"
arranged version of Xenogears' soundtrack. It contains really good arranges
of already awesome BGMs.
Oh, and the Xenogears Original Soundtrack also includes a track which 
wasn't included in the game: "Stars of Tears", an awesome arrange of the
overworld theme, with English lyrics (as well, of course, as "Small Two
of Pieces"). The Creid album does include "Two Wings" and "Mebius", the
Japanese versions of "Stars of Tears" and "Small Two of Pieces", but IMHO
they're not as good as the English versions (especially "Mebius").

BTW, it's not exactly true that "Stars of Tears" wasn't included in the
game. It is played during a FMV composed of different FMV bits from the
game. The problem is that I don't have a clue about how to play it except
by using CDFind and PSXVideo. Oh, and just because I know you, don't mail me
asking where to find neither of these utilities! :P



XENOGEARS MEASUREMENT UNITS  ____________________________________________
by Pauzanes Neto (shinji08@geocities.com)


I'm just quoting (and editing a bit) Pauzanes' rather interesting text:


With the "help" of the people at Square USA, I was able to calculate the
real world equivalents for the measurements form Xenogears. Square has set
up a page for XenoGears, and there they have tables with Gear data. Their
own ratios, however, won't match up a 100% [Ignacio's note : because of
truncation]. Nonetheless, the accuracy rate of my conversion factors is of
aproximately 99.36%.  So, I guess we can use it. =)

  Here we go:

   1 Sharl  = 0.964 meters  = 3.1629 feet
   1 Karn   = 1.080 tons    = 2381.4 lbs.
   1 Repsol = 0.970 km/h
   1 Zeitle = 0.017 hours


Ex: Let's use Weltall.

Its height is of 16.3 sharls. The conversion factor is: 1 Sharl = .963
meters.

                            0.964 meters
    (1)    16.3 Sharls  x   ------------
                              1 Sharl
    (2)    16.3 x 0.964 meters          [ Sharls cancel ]
    (3)    15.71 meters. So Weltall's actual height is of 15.71 meters.

Square USA says it is of 15.811 meters. The Percentage of Accuracy is of:

    (1)    Percent of Accuracy = (Actual / Theoretical) x 100%
    (2)    Percent of Accuracy = (15.71 / 15.811 ) x 100%
    (3)    Percent of Accuracy = 99.361%

Questions for parts of the FAQ not yet covered.
   How am I supposed to help you in a place I've not been to yet? Duh.

Questions for parts of the FAQ already covered.
   Questions about important bits left unexplained in the FAQ are quite
   rare, and I'd like to think it's because my walkthrough is comprehensive
   enough ^_^; However, if you have a good point, I'll revise that part in
   future versions.

Contributions for parts of the FAQ not yet covered.
   After much thinking and pondering, I've finally decided that I will
   ignore these. There are two reasons for this:
   First, it's not fair for people that wait until I reach that point to
   tell me, not to mention it's not fair for ME, who most of the times could
   have found the thing for myself (you'd be surprised to hear what some
   people contribute).
   Second, these questions form the bulk of the 200+ mails in my account,
   since for some reason everybody seems to have found a extremelly well
   hidden secret in places I've not yet been to (but very few do in places
   I've already been in, surprisingly).
   Since I already told not to send me these contributions in version 0.3
   of the FAQ, I feel I have every right to ignore them from now on. Sorry.
   You might be wondering why did I put the "Three Shevat Stones" thing
   then. Well, I wish I hadn't... 

Contributions for parts of the FAQ already covered.
   When I'm able to read them (which will take quite a lot of time, as you
   already know), I'll file them and add them to the FAQ later (not
   neccesarily for the next revision, since I'm currently browsing and
   separating mail). Note that I won't mail you back to thank you, but rest
   assured, you have my sincerest gratitude, and I'll thank you properly in
   the FAQ itself.


 S p e c i f i c   q u e s t i o n s   r e g a r d i n g   t h e   g a m e


"Could there be any other characters than the ones listed in the FAQ?"
   No. I knew all of them thanks to my Action Replay even before playing
   the game through, so I knew who would show up beforehand, and there's
   no one else.

"Booohooo! But Ramsus/Id/<insert NPC name here> is soooo cool!"
   Sorry.

"Boohoo!"
   Oh, do shut up.

"The measurement unit ratio by Pauzanes Neto isn't correct. If you
divide Weltall's height in meters by it in Sharls you get 0.97."
   Yes it is. He didn't use Weltall to OBTAIN it, and due to rounding
   there's no way to get all conversions to match 100%. Think, people.

"Where's <insert item name here> which's mentioned in your item lists but
not in your walkthrough?"
   The item lists were made using an Action Replay. Even so, most of these
   items have been confirmed by contributors, but I'm not putting them until
   I reach that far into the game. Of course, if they are obtained in a part
   the walkthrough already covers, then I've, ohmygosh, completelly missed 
   them. So if you happen to have found them, please be so kind as to send 
   me their locations, thank you kind reader.

"I've found that in the Duneman's Desert..."
   AAAARRGHH! Shut up already!! I know!! Sorry people, but for some reason
   everyone has thought it fit to bomb me with info about the couple of
   items I left out in the mini-guide for that place.
   The thing is, that part was from the Japanese walkthrough. Back then I
   didn't double and triple-check things as much as I'm doing now with the
   Walkthrough, so I missed some items (OK, I just followed Tatsushi Nakao's
   guide step by step and didn't bother to explore on my own, I own up
   ^_^;).
   I guess it as much as proves that "if you are going to do something,
   better do it through", so I've decided to remove all parts not yet
   covered by the American walkthrough. Namely, the Duneman's Desert, since
   all other parts have been incorporated into the walkthrough.

"Why does it say 'Episode V' at the very end of the game? Are there another
four Xenogears games?"
   Of course. Didn't you know? The other four episodes were released for the 
   SNES and were major hits in Japan, but they weren't released in the US, 
   in favor of US-developed games like "Final Fantasy Evermore" and "Secret
   of Mystic Quest". 
   Just kidding. Seriously, this is the first and so far the last Xenogears 
   game Square has ever made. Believe me on this, I can recite the whole 
   Squaresoft ludography (hey! a new word!) back from Rad Racer times off the
   top of my head, and not a single Xenogears game makes an appearance. I
   seriously doubt this is a reference to any other Square game either.

"Very nice. So, umm... what the heck IS that 'Episode V' thing, then? :\ "
   Good question. And one that's been in the minds of everyone since 
   Xenogears was first released in Japan. Your guess is as good as mine.
   The only coherent explanation I've heard contains, unfortunately, a 
   spoiler, so I'd rather not list it here (besides, it's still highly 
   unlikely in my opinion. I'm afraid we'll never know.



   S p e c i f i c   q u e s t i o n s   R e g a r d i n g   t h e   F A Q


"Hurry up and finish the dang walkthrough!"
   Go bother someone else. Oh, if you get stupid enough you might get a
   place along with ProPimp9 in the Idiot List.

"Can you send me new revisions of your FAQ?"
   For some reason, this is the single most asked question (with all its
   "send me your FAQ now" etc... variations). Well, in a word, NO. Even if
   it's to put it up in your cool huge megahit page, I will only send new
   revisions to GameFaqs and K.M.'s page.

"Can you notify me when you update your FAQ?"
   Sorry, but no. You don't seem to realize that you are hundreds and I just
   can't spare the time.

"Can I put your FAQ in my page?"
   You don't need to send me these, as I'll always grant you permission to
   do so (no need to ask nor even notify me) AS LONG AS you don't edit or
   otherwise modify this document, and as long as you assure you'll get new
   revisions of it from the above pages.

"You said that your saved game was wiped. Mine was too. Does XenoGears have
some kind of anti-unofficial memory card protection?"
   I've received quite a lot of these too. Well, first off, my game was 
   wiped because it was stored in a crappy multipage Memory Card. It was by 
   no means the first time it happened to me: in fact, if you have one of 
   those Memory Cards, you'll know it happens all the time (I've had two 
   different models so far; everything they might say about that being "an 
   isolated problem" etc... is a plain and big LIE to sell it to you). I 
   always back up important game saves in the PC's hard drive with my Action 
   Replay and the Comms Kit (THAT method is 100% safe). It's just that I 
   delayed doing so until it was, well, too late ^_^;. But I'm straying off 
   the topic. What I want to say is that my Memory Card problem was 
   completelly unrelated to XenoGears itself. However, the very fact of 
   having received that many mails regarding this issue might indicate that 
   there is some truth to that after all... 
   BTW, if you have storage problems, I'd reccomend Blaze's 2 MB or 4 MB 
   Cards. It has just two pages, but they are real, because the card uses 
   no compression. To change between pages, just remove the card, switch it,
   and insert it again (no wait). And it costs the same as an official 
   Memory Card. OK, talk about straying off the topic... ^_^;

"Your grammar and spelling aren't too great. You should have someone check
them"
   I received just one of these, but it bothered me somewhat so I though
   I'd address it in a separate paragraph.
   1) I'm Spanish. This FAQ is about all the English practising I'm doing
   now. Try to write a FAQ in Spanish, and then you tell me about errors,
   OK? Besides, I honestly think that my English is quite acceptable for a
   Spanish.
   2) Because of living in Spain, I don't have access to any spellchecking
   program in English. Don't go offering me any of these, though: even if
   I had one, it's probably too much work to bother.
   3) Finally, if you're that much concerned about grammar and spelling, how
   about sending in some (shock!) corrections? Or is it too much bother for
   you?

"Can I co-write / translate to other language / htmlize / spellcheck the
FAQ?"
   In one word, no. I accept no co-writers, nor do I support any translation
   or HTML version of the FAQ (and bear in mind that since my work is
   copyrighted, you can't do any of these without my permission). BTW, I
   really am Spanish and talk in Spanish, but I decided to write this FAQ in
   English so it would reach more people (you need to know English to play
   the game anyway). There's no Spanish version of the FAQ and again I won't
   support one.
   Finally, since I can't support a whole spellchecked FAQ from anyone
   without comparing both FAQs word by word (and that, I assure you, I'm not
   going to do), I'll pass on the latter one as well. With that said,
   individual corrections of any kind will of course be accepted and much
   thanked.

"Hi! Remember me? I'm <insert name of former contributors I started to chat
with>. How are you doing?" (and sometimes, not unreasonably "Are you still
alive?" ^_^;)
   These will (sob) have to be (sniff) temporarily delayed, because I have
   my hands full with just reading all the mail. I've not talked with even
   K.M. or Zhou Tai An for the last four months or so, so sorry and be
   patient ;_;. I know this sucks (hell, one of the main reasons I write
   walkthroughs is to talk to people who share my tastes...).



==========================================================================
   1 2   .   H O W   T O   C O N T A C T   M E
==========================================================================


Well, to make a long story short, I receive just too much mail regarding
this FAQ to be able to answer to all of it and have a life at the same time.
Though some of you might ask what use is having a life anyway, I've decide
that I won't answer any of them. Yup, that's it, no replies at all. So that
means that your questions won't be answered directly, and your contributions
will not be thanked personally. I know it sucks, but it's the only way.

In order to stop the tide of mails, I've put the most frequent reasons to
mail me and the results they will bear in the Frequently Asked Questions
section. However, in case you miss it, you should know that questions, 
contributions, etc... for parts of the game not yet covered by the
walkthrough will be I G N O R E D. This also includes items which are
obtained or used in these parts, even if their use is wrong in the item
lists.

Unfortunatelly, as of revision 0.5, I must ask you not to send me ANY mail
AT ALL. This, believe it or not, is because I'm so late in reading mail that 
I wouldn't be able to even read, sort out and include everything I've
received so far in at least a year (and just between you and me, I don't
actually think I'll still writing this FAQ a year from now). I've been VERY
busy since I started working six months ago (I'm late in even serious duties)
and I don't think it's going to get any better. So it's either that or
stopping the FAQ completelly (you'll already have noticed how slow it's
progressing compared to before). Sorry, and thanks for your support.

Just to prove my lack of time, I have Final Fantasy 8 from over a month, and
I'm not even halfway disc one yet. To think I completed FF7 in a week! ;_;

If you MUST send me some information, and you don't care if it's read by my 
grand-grand children, then send it to:

  < de_lucas@yahoo.com >

 - For keeping me updated with his awesome translations of the Japanese
   version, which you can find at Gamefaqs if you are wondering. Also for
   notes on character and Gear battle, and general all around assistance :).
   But mainly, for being a great guy and one hell of a friend.

Whoever at Square who translated the US version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Thanks for saving this AWESOME game from the clutches of the former
   Square translator (shiver). Xenogears' best point is its story, which 
   would have suffered no end. Also, he/she managed to translate every 
   item with both faithfulness and inventiveness, a true feat given the 
   space and language constraints. Congratulations! 



And of course, a huge Thank You to:

 - Where to start? For being the original co-writer of this FAQ (and thus
   being the source of a lot of the info in it), for hosting this and others
   FAQs of mine, for being an awesome friend and a great guy... do I forget
   something? ^_^; Oh yes, for his hyper-complete FF7 FAQ, but that's
   another story...



THE IDIOT LIST __________________________________________________________

Yes people, the section you all love from K.M.'s FF7 FAQ (we love you K.M.)
makes a return in this FAQ. There's only one idiot so far, but give them
time...

Right after getting a new Internet connection, I started to reply to mail.
One of the first that reared its ugly head was this one:

> Come on, when the hell are you gonna get the fuckin disc 2 walktrough,
> come on, im at like near the end, and want a walktrough, cant your sorry
> ass finish it!!!!!
> one you finally finish it, mail me.... ProPimp9@aol.com

Well Mr. ProPimply, if you "want a walkthrough" so bad, could you please
explain to me what's holding you from writing one yourself? Maybe it's just
that it's far more easy to download it from the 'net than to devote hours
and hours to write it?

I know that K.M. wouldn't have judged this guy to be worth putting in his
idiot list, but you know, I'm not as nice as him.

Since my "please don't mail me" rant has already been covered in the "How
to contact me" section, there's not much to say here ^_^;
