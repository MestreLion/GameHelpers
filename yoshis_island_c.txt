1.                               Introduction

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yoshi's Island is the sequel to Super Mario World on the SNES. This game is set 
in the past, when Mario is a baby, and is dropped by a stork onto Yoshi's 
Island. The Yoshis get together and decide to return Mario to his parents, but 
Bowser interferes, and sends a huge range of enemies out into the many levels 
of the game. Unlike previous Mario games, you control Yoshi instead of Mario.

This game has excellent graphics, from the start of the game all the way to the 
end. The screen scrolls left and right very smoothly, and gives quite a zoomed 
out view to allow you to see quite far into the distance before you even get 
there. There is great detail on the foreground as well as the background, and 
though all of the levels are different from one another, they all retain the 
same amount of detail.

In all, there are six worlds in this game, each of which contain eight normal 
levels and one secret level. Add to that one tutorial level, and there are 
fifty-five levels! Quite an incredible statistic for a game, considering the 
size and detail in each and every level, most of which contain new enemies and 
all of which contain new and original backgrounds, items, and tasks to do.

At the end each level, you're given a score depending on how many of the 
required items you picked up on your journey through the level. More often than 
not, these items are hidden high up in difficult to reach places. Finding them 
all in a single level can be difficult, especially when you have an abundance 
of enemies rushing at you from all different directions. But if you do happen 
to get 100% in the eight normal levels on a world, the secret, extra-difficult 
level will be unlocked.

Overall, Yoshi's Island is a superb game. It's one of the few games that I've 
bought for my SNES which I still play occasionally. The originality and size of 
the game are incredible, with 55 huge levels and 127 enemies. Try not to be put 
off by first appearances, as what may first seem to be a simple game will soon 
turn into one of the most complex and difficult platform games on the SNES.

2.                                  Moves

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eat
  Upon pressing Y, Yoshi sticks his tongue out. Providing he's close enough to 
  an enemy, Yoshi will usually grab them. From here, you can either spit them 
  out or swallow them.

Hover
  Hold B in the air to hover. This move can be used to travel long distances, 
  and to reach places that you wouldn't be able to with a normal jump.

Jump
  The basic jump.

Run
  Continue to hold left or right, and Yoshi will run fast in that direction.

Shoot
  Providing Yoshi has at least one egg, tapping A to display the egg target, 
  and then releasing A, Yoshi will shoot an egg in the direction he's facing.

Spit
  When Yoshi has an enemy in his mouth, tap Y to spit them out. This is useful 
  for defeating other enemies and opening winged clouds.

Stomp
  While in the air, press down to stomp the ground. This can be used to defeat 
  strong enemies, but as it's quite a slow move, it can be very difficult to 
  hit the faster enemies.

Swallow
  When Yoshi has an enemy in his mouth, tap down to swallow them. Yoshi will 
  receive an egg.

3.                                Walkthrough

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===============================================================================
                       Intro: Welcome To Yoshi's Island
===============================================================================

This introductory level is here to give new players the chance to get used to 
the controls of the game before the first level. As this is a tutorial level, 
there isn't too much to worry about in the way of enemies and other dangers, so 
I'll use this section of the guide to explain about some of the basic controls 
used in the game. For more specific information, hints and advice on playing 
the game, hit the various message blocks in the game.

At the start of the game, press right on the D-Pad and scroll through the 
messages that pop up on screen. Run past the red arrow on the right to come to 
the first enemy in the game: a Shy Guy. There are various ways to beat enemies 
in this game. As enemies get more difficult later on in the game, some ways may 
work better or worse than others, or may not work at all. Here are all of the 
ways to beat the Shy Guys in this section of the level:

Option 1: Jump
  This is the most basic option for beating most of the easy enemies. Just jump  
  up by pressing X and land on top of the Shy Guy.

Option 2: Pound
  Jump up over the top of the Shy Guy and press down to make Yoshi stamp on the 
  floor. This is more powerful than the jump, but is much slower. For slow 
  enemies such as the Shy Guy in this section of the level, this is fine, but 
  you will need to be accurate.

Option 3: Spit
  Get close to the first Shy Guy and press Y to grab him. Press Y again to spit 
  the enemy out. This is useful for defeating a second enemy, such as the 
  second Shy Guy in this section of the level.

Option 4: Egg
  Get close to the first Shy Guy and press Y to grab him. Press down to create 
  an egg. With the egg, face the second shy guy and press A to bring up a 
  target. Egg throwing is one of the most useful features for defeating enemies 
  in the game, but can look quite confusing at first. When the egg target comes 
  up, wait until it points toward the second Shy Guy, and then press A again to 
  shoot the egg. To pause the egg target, press either the L or R button. To 
  bring up the target and not shoot an egg at all, press down on the D-Pad or 
  press Y to cancel the egg.

With both Shy Guys out of the way, continue right to come to a platform 
consisting of five blocks, with some coins high above. The middle block is 
purple, and increases in size when hit. Hit the purple block, and then jump up 
to the top of it. You can now collect the coins that were too high to reach 
before.

Jump off the right side of the purple block and land on the rock. Jump up to 
the next rock on the right to land near a message block. Hitting the block will 
give information on the Hovering Jump, which can be used to cross large 
distances or gain extra height in jumps. Run right until you come to the edge 
of the path, and then jump high into the gap. Hold up, right and X to hover up 
to the top of the high rock on the other side.

Walk right to come to a small spring ball. Spring balls are used to help Yoshi 
bounce much higher than a normal jump. For a spring ball to work, jump high and 
then jump again as soon as you land on the ball. Launch up to the rock high up 
on the right, and then run right to come to a large spring ball. This is 
similar to the small spring ball, but it launches Yoshi much higher. Use this 
ball to launch up to the rock on the right.

Go right after landing to arrive near two Shy Guys. Use any of the four 
possible attacks shown earlier in this level walkthrough to defeat the Shy 
Guys, and then run right to exit the level.


===============================================================================
                       Level 1-1: Make Eggs, Throw Eggs
===============================================================================

                                 - Flower 1 -

Run right when the level starts, and pass under the message block to come to 
two Shy Guys. Eat both Shy Guys to create two eggs, and continue right until 
you see a platform above with a Shy Guy on it. Jump up to the platform and eat 
the Shy Guy to make a third egg, and then jump off the right side of the 
platform to collect the first flower.

                                 - Flower 2 -

After landing on the blue rock, eat the Shy Guy and jump high off the right 
side of the rock to avoid a Pirahna Plant. Run under the second message block 
to arrive near a platform with a winged cloud above. Jump up to the platform, 
eat the Shy Guy, and shoot an egg at the cloud, which will create some steps 
leading up to the left. Climb the steps to the long platform at the top, and 
collect the middle row of six red coins. Go to the far left side of the 
platform to collect the second flower.

                                 - Flower 3 -

As soon as you collect the second flower, a Fly Guy holding a winged cloud will 
appear up on the left. He doesn't stay for long, so quickly shoot an egg at him 
to burst the cloud, which will make five stars fall down to the platform below. 
Collect the stars, and then jump back up to the platform on the right. Run 
right and go down the steps to the platform at the bottom. Drop down off the 
right edge to activate two Pirahna Plants. Shoot an egg at the bottom plant, 
and go down the pipe on the other side.

After arriving in the cave, go right and drop off the edge to land near an egg 
block. Hit the block to collect eggs, and then go right. Before collecting any 
of the items above, push Chomp Rock all the way to the wall on the right to 
defeat two Shy Guys. Leave the rock near the wall, and run back left to the 
start of the cave. Shoot eggs at the six red coins in the area, and shoot the 
two Fly Guys to make them each drop a red coin.

Shoot an egg at the Baron Von Zeppelin holding the extra life, and push Chomp 
Rock back over to the wall at the right side of the cave. Shoot an egg off the 
ceiling so that it rebounds into the open tulip, which will throw out eight 
stars. Collect all the stars, and run right. Jump on Chomp Rock, hop up to the 
ledge on the right, and then go up the pipe. After emerging from the pipe, jump 
over the wall on the left to collect the third flower.

                                 - Flower 4 -

Walk up the small steep slope on the right, and jump across the gap to land on 
the blue rock. Shoot an egg at the Pirahna Plant that appears, and then jump 
down to any one of the four purple circling platforms. When the platform goes 
low, drop down off the right side of the platform to land on a long platform. 
Collect all four red coins on the platform and run over to the left side to 
collect the fourth flower.

                                 - Flower 5 -

Jump back on one of the circling platforms and jump off to land on the blue 
rock up on the right. Run down the slope to find a pipe which Shy Guys are 
jumping out of. Eat the Shy Guys until Yoshi has six eggs, and then shoot an 
egg up at the winged cloud above, collecting the five stars that fall. Jump 
over the pipe and continue right, eating both Crazee Dayzees along the way.

Shoot an egg at the winged cloud, and climb up the left side of the newly 
created beanstalk. Near the top of the beanstalk, jump off to land on the rock 
on the left, and continue left to find a winged cloud off the edge of a rock. 
Shoot an egg at the winged cloud to reveal the fifth and final flower. Jump off 
the rock to collect the flower, and hover right to land on a rock below.

Although it seems there is nothing on this rock, run right to reveal a hidden 
winged cloud. Shoot an egg at the cloud to reveal five stars, and then drop 
down off the left side of the rock. Go right and climb back up the beanstalk to 
the top, but this time jump up to one of the purple circling platforms above. 
Collect the two red coins when the platform gets to the highest point, and then 
jump over to the blue rock on the right.

Go right to find Chomp Rock. Push it down the hill on the right to defeat two 
Shy Guys and a Pirahna Plant. Jump over Chomp Rock to land on the blue rock on 
the other side. Shoot the neabry winged cloud for five stars. From the rock, 
run right and jump over the five Shy Guys to come to the goal ring. Jump 
through the goal ring to complete the level.

===============================================================================
                           Level 1-2: Watch Out Below!
===============================================================================

                                   - Flower 1 -

Run right at the start of the level and jump up the small step. Go up the slope 
and drop down the other side to arrive near two Shy Guys. Eat both Shy Guys and 
continue right. Go up the slope and jump at the top to collect the first 
flower.

                                   - Flower 2 -

From this point in the level to the first middle ring, Chomps will jump from 
the background to make gaps in the floor. The first Chomp will make a gap in 
the floor just after the first flower. Jump the gap and eat the Crazee Dayzee 
on the other side, and then continue up the slope to the top. Jump over the 
small ledge to land near six coins, then quickly hold right and stop under the 
third and fourth coins, which are red coins.

Jump up to collect the red coins, and continue right, jumping over the various 
gaps along the way, to come to a winged cloud. A Chomp will fall down and 
create a gap under the winged cloud, so don't go near it just yet. When the 
Chomp has created the gap, shoot the winged cloud to reveal the second flower, 
and jump over the gap to collect it.

                                   - Flower 3 -

Go right and drop down the step to land near six more coins. The red coins are 
the four middle coins, but be careful as Chomps can create gaps under the first 
and fourth coin. Use a Hover jump to collect the coins, and continue right to 
come to a post. Jump over the first post and eat both Shy Guys, and then shoot 
an egg up at the winged cloud to receive five stars. Collect the stars, then 
jump over the second post and continue right to pass the Middle Ring.

Go right to come to a Shy Guy pipe, and eat Shy Guys until Yoshi has six eggs. 
This will stop the Shy Guys coming out of the pipe, so you can have some time 
to look around. Shoot an egg at the fluffy ceiling above and collect the four 
red coins that are up there, and then shoot an egg through the fluffy wall on 
the right. Shoot a final egg up through the ceiling to make the spring ball 
fall down. Go and collect some more eggs by eating the enemies coming out of 
the Shy Guy pipe, and then bounce up to the next area by using the spring ball.

After landing on the platform, two red arrows will be pointing right. Although 
you can go left, it only leads through a hidden tunnel in the wall to an area 
with an expansion block. So follow the arrows advice and go right through the 
hidden wall. Jump up the two platforms to come to a junction. If you choose to 
go right here, you can follow a path along to a hidden winged cloud which 
contains a 1UP. Apart from the 1UP though, there's nothing else of interest, so 
go left at the junction to come to two more platforms. Jump up the platforms 
and go left at the junction to pass through the second middle ring in the 
level.

After passing the second middle ring, go right and jump over the small gap. On 
the other side of the hidden tunnel, run under the message block and enter the 
hidden tunnel on the right. Bounce off the small spring ball and exit the 
hidden tunnel high up on the right. Go down the slope on the other side to 
arrive near a message block and a Metamorphosis Bubble. Touch the bubble to 
transform into a helicopter. Fly right and go under the first hidden tunnel 
section to collect two red coins. Go up after collecting the final coin to 
collect the third flower.

                                   - Flower 4 -

Continue right after collecting the third flower, and pass through the set of 
coins that lead down and right. After these coins, there will be a section of 
wall which has three hidden entrances, one on the left, one on the right and 
one at the bottom. Go up through the tunnel at the bottom of the wall to find 
the fourth flower.

                                   - Flower 5 -

Exit the tunnel and then fly up and right past the Gusty. When you see the 
floating island over on the right (which has arrows pointing down and right on 
it), go right along the island and then go up and right at the end. When you 
come to the two red arrows on the ceiling that point down, go up close to the 
arrows and then fly through the hidden tunnel on the right. Follow the tunnel 
down and right to collect three red coins, and then fly down and left after 
exiting the tunnel to hit the Yoshi Block, which will return Yoshi to normal. 

Run right to come to a pipe, but don't enter it just yet. Instead, jump up to 
one of the platforms on either side of the pipe, and then jump up into the 
small hidden area just above the platforms to collect two more red coins. Drop 
down to the pipe and go down it.

After arriving in the final area, shoot an egg at the winged cloud to reveal 
the fifth flower. Quickly shoot the Fly Guy holding the 1UP, and then jump up 
to collect the flower. Run right and hover jump over the Pirahna Plant to 
collect the three red coins. On the other side, eat the nearby Shy Guy, and 
shoot an egg at the winged cloud to reveal five stars. Run right, eating the 
Crazee Dayzee and Shy Guy along the way, and watch out for the final Chomp 
which creates a gap just left of the red arrow. Jump over the gap, and jump 
through the goal ring on the other side to complete the level.

~~ Items ~~

1UP
  After passing the first middle ring, use the large spring ball behind the 
  wall on the right to jump up into the area above. Go right at the first 
  junction, and right at the second junction. Continue right and drop down off 
  the edge of the path next to the arrow pointing left. After landing, continue 
  right and run through two hidden walls right to reveal a hidden cloud near a 
  third wall. Shoot an egg at the cloud to receive a 1UP.

  first hidden tunnel section to find this flower.

Flower 4
  About half-way through the journey from the Metamorphosis Bubble to the Yoshi 
  Block, there will be a set of coins leading down and right. After these 
  coins, there will be a section of wall. Go up through the hidden tunnel at 
  the bottom of the wall to find the fourth flower.

Flower 5
  After arriving in the final area of the level, shoot an egg at the first 
  winged cloud to reveal this flower.

  first hidden tunnel section to collect these red coins.

3 Red Coins

  but don't touch it. Instead, go straight up to the ceiling with the arrows 
  pointing down, and then fly right to enter a hidden tunnel which contains 
  these coins.

2 Red Coins
  At the end of the area with the helicopter, there is a pipe which leads to 
  the next area. There is a small secret area above the pipe which contains 
  these coins.

===============================================================================
                        Level 1-3: The Cave Of Chomp Rock
===============================================================================

                                   - Flower 1 -

This level starts outside, with a green pipe on the right which leads down to 
the cave. Jump on top of the pipe to activate a Pirahna Plant over on the 
right, and providing you have some eggs left over, shoot an egg at the plant. 
With the plant defeated, jump over to the ledge where it used to be to find a 
hidden winged cloud. Shoot the winged cloud to receive a 1UP, and then go down 
the pipe.

As soon as you arrive in the cave, a Chomp Rock will start rolling down the 
slope up on the left. Let the rock push you down the slope to the post at the 
bottom, then jump over the post and stomp the crate on the other side. Collect 
all six stars, and continue right to find a fluffy wall. Eat the Nipper Plant, 
and then jump up to the top of the wall. Walk over to the middle of the wall, 
and stomp the post two times to receive a single red coin.

Run right and eat the Shy Guy up on top of the mushroom. Jump up to the 
mushroom, and hover jump over the Nipper Plants below to collect the top four 
red coins. On the other side of the Nipper Plant pit, run right up the steep 
slope and drop off the end of the path to land on a mushroom. A Chomp Rock is 
visible over on the right, but don't go there just yet. Instead, drop down to 
the lowest mushroom, and then go down the gap below it to land in a tunnel. 
Follow the tunnel down and along, and collect the first flower and the two red 
coins at the end.

                                   - Flower 2 -

Eat the two Lantern Ghosts if Yoshi needs more eggs, and then run back up the 
tunnel and jump out of the gap under the mushroom. Climb up the steps on the 
right to the Chomp Rock at the top, and push it down the slope. Follow the rock 
down until it collides with a second Chomp Rock, and then continue following 
the first rock down the path on the left. Push the rock along the path to 
defeat two Nipper Plants, and collect the second flower and the two red coins 
at the end.

                                   - Flower 3 -

Head back to the right, noticing the door above with the keyhole along the way, 
and push the Chomp Rock down the slope on the right. Follow the Chomp Rock down 
into the small cave, and jump up to the mushroom. Collect all four red coins, 
and shoot an egg at the winged cloud to reveal five stars. Collect the stars 
and exit the cave on the left. Run up the small slope and jump up to the first 
slope on the right. Run up the slope in the path, and jump over to the mushroom 
on the left. Jump up to the platform on the left and pass through the middle 
ring to receive 10 stars.

Drop down off the right side of the platform and continue right up the path to

Jump up the small step at the start of the level and stomp the post two times 
to collect a red coin. Jump onto the see-saw platform on the right and run over 
to the right side to collect the red coin. Jump over to the fluff and wait for 
the Woozy Guy to bounce up from the lower section of fluff on the right. Eat 
the Woozy Guy and then drop down to the fluff on the right.

Eat the eggs coming out of the Egg Plant until Yoshi has six eggs. Jump up the 
two steps in the fluff on the right and jump over to the see-saw platform. 
Quickly jump off to the right side of the platform to land on the block of 
fluff. At this point, Lakitu will appear.

Jump to the next see-saw platform and then jump to the small fluff path on the 
right. Eat the Shy Guy on the path and continue moving right before Lakitu 
starts throwing enemies at you. Jump to the next see-saw platform and run over 
to the right side to collect a single red coin. Jump over the fluff wall on the 
right and land on the fluff path on the other side.

Eat the Woozy Guy that bounces toward you and then run down the two small 
steps. Eat the Shy Guy at the bottom of the steps and then shoot of Lakitu. 
With Lakitu gone, shoot an egg at the Fly Guy to make him drop the coin, and 
shoot an egg at the winged cloud to reveal the first flower. Collect the red 
coin and shoot an egg up at the first flower to collect it.

                                   - Flower 2 -

Continue right and jump over the red shell on the fluff wall. On the other side 
of the red shell, shoot another egg up at Lakitu if he's appeared, and then eat 
the green shell. Wait for the tulip to open, and then shoot the green shell 
into the tulip to make it throw out eight stars. Collect the stars and continue 
right. Jump over the small wall at the end of the fluff path and land on the 
see-saw platform on the other side. Run to the right side of the see-saw 
platform and jump onto the small platform outside of the tunnel on the right.

Go right to enter the tunnel and jump up to eat the red shell on the ledge. 
Drop back down to the left and shoot the red shell out of the tunnel. Shoot an 
egg up the first gap in the tunnel to reveal a winged cloud. Shoot the winged 
cloud for five stars and then jump up to the ledge on the right. Drop down the 
other side and eat the Shy Guy. Shoot an egg straight up into the gap after 
landing to reveal another winged cloud. Shoot this winged cloud to receive a 
red switch, and then stomp the red switch to make the red blocks appear over on 
the right.

Quickly jump up to the ledge on the right and knock the green shell right. Drop 
down onto the fluff and follow the green shell right as it hits into the Shy 
Guy. Jump up the small step in the fluff and jump over the green shell before 
the step down. Drop down the step and continue right to come to some tiny fluff 
platforms leading over a crate. Eat the Woozy Guy and then jump up to the 
highest fluff platform. Stomp down through the fluff and land on the crate to 
receive a key. Quickly collect the key and jump out of the left side of the gap 
to land back on the fluff.

Continue left back to the winged cloud near the exit of the tunnel. Shoot an 
egg at the winged cloud to receive five stars, and then walk right. Eat the 
eggs coming out of the Egg Plant until Yoshi has six eggs, and then shoot an 
egg up at the red coin at the left side of the egg plant. Go right and jump up 
the small step. Shoot an egg up at the winged cloud for five stars.

Shoot an egg up at the red coin just left of the green shell, and then run 
right to the tiny fluff platforms. Jump up and over the platforms and eat the 
Woozy Guy that bounces up from the other side. On the other side of the tiny 
fluff platform, collect the second and sixth red coins in the line and then 
shoot an egg through the fluff steps to collect the second flower.

                                   - Flower 3 -

Jump over the gap in the steps and climb up to the top. Pick up the green shell 
at the top and walk over to the right side of the top step. Jump straight up 
and shoot the green shell at the winged cloud to receive five stars. Run down 
the steps to come to a Pokey throwing a Needlenose. Collect the red coin at the 
left side of Pokey and then eat the Needlenose to defeat the Pokey. Jump over 
to the other side of the Pokey and eat the Woozy Guy. Walk right and open the 
blue doors with the key.

In this train area, there is a large train track which leads to the flower. 
I've created a map, found at the top of this level walkthrough, which lists the 
locations of the Metamorphosis Bubbles as well as the coins. Read the next 
paragraph for the text walkthrough to this area:

Hit the first Metamorphosis Bubble to transform into a train and follow these 
directions to the flower and the Yoshi Block: 2nd Right, Up, 2nd Right, Up, 
Right, 2nd Up, Right (to collect the third flower), Down, Right, Up, Right, 2nd 
Down (to land on the path near the Yoshi Block). Go left after landing on the 
grass path to hit the Yoshi Block. Walk left and go through the blue doors.

                                   - Flower 4 -

After returning to the first area, jump up to the platform above. Jump up to 
the grass path on the left and run left. Drop down the two platforms at the 
edge of the grass path and drop out of the tunnel to land near a Chomp Rock. 
Push the Chomp Rock slowly to the right until it is under the tunnel leading 
up. Jump onto the Chomp Rock and then jump up to the ledge on the right. Go 
through the blue doors.

After arriving in the second area, run right and pass through the middle ring. 
Shoot an egg at the winged cloud near the post on the right and collect the 
five stars. Jump up and collect the red coin above the post. On the other side 
of the post, jump over the Crazee Dayzee and then quickly shoot an egg up at 
the second Fly Guy on the right holding the red coin before he flies away.

Walk back to the left and shoot the remaining Fly Guy to receive another red 
coin. Jump up to collect the red coin above the red side of the yellow flowers, 
and then jump up to the ledge on the right. Eat the Shy Guys coming out of the 
pipe until Yoshi has six eggs, and then drop down to the grass path on the 
right. Eat the Crazee Dayzee and continue right to come to a small spring ball.

Around this point in the level, Lakitu will reappear. Bounce on the spring ball 
and Eat the Fly Guy that flies down holding the red coin. Collect the red coin 
and then jump on the spring ball. Bounce up to land on Lakitu so that he leaves 
his cloud, and then jump up to land on the cloud. On the cloud, fly left under 
the three blocks of fluff and then fly up and left to land on a high ledge 
above the entrance to this area.

Run left on the ledge to reveal a winged cloud. Shoot the winged cloud to 
receive five stars, and then walk right off the edge of the path to drop onto a 
post. Stomp the post two times and run into the cave on the left to reveal 
another hidden winged cloud. Shoot this winged cloud to find a red switch. Jump 
on the red switch and then jump onto the small post on the right. Jump up to 
the ledge on the left and press down on the red arrow.

After arriving in the secret area, there will be a long drop down to the path. 
On the path, run right along the tunnel to come to a high room with fifteen 
rotating platforms. Jump up all the platforms to the top and then go up the 
pipe to exit the area.

After returning to the second area, run right to the small spring ball and jump 
up to the ledge on the right. Eat Lakitu and then fire an egg over at the 
Bubble Dayzee on the right. Jump over to the small fluff ledge on the right and 
eat the Fly Guy holding the red coin on the other side. Jump straight up and 
tap down. Yoshi will stomp through the fluff but will stop shortly after 
revealing a winged cloud.

Jump over to the path on the right and collect the red coin, then face left and 
shoot an egg at the winged cloud for five stars. Jump over the pipe on the 
right and eat the Bubble Dayzee on the other side. Jump over the gap to the 
ledge on the right and shoot an egg straight up to reveal the flower. Shoot an 
egg up to collect the fourth flower.

                                   - Flower 5 -

Jump over the gap to the path on the right and shoot the winged cloud at the 
left side of the three posts for five stars. Shoot an egg at the Cactus Jack 
and then shoot an egg at Lakitu. Go right and jump onto the posts. Stomp the 
middle post three times to reveal a winged cloud, and stomp the right post 
twice for a red coin. Shoot the winged cloud for a 1UP, then run right and jump 
over the gap. On the other side of the gap, continue right and eat the Bubble 
Dayzee. Shoot an egg up at the first winged cloud to reveal the fifth flower 
and then shoot another egg to collect it.

Continue right and jump onto the first post. Stomp the post twice to collect a

stars. Jump up to collect the middle red coin at the left side of the Bubble 
Dayzee up on the ledge, and then run right through the small tunnel. On the

After arriving in the third castle area, run right along the first tunnel and 
drop down into the sloped water tunnel at the end. At the bottom of the water 
tunnel, immediately run right to avoid the Hootie the Blue Fish that is lurking 
on the left. Continue to run right to drop down into a wider tunnel. Jump up 
the two white platforms on the right, and then jump right into the gap to 
collect the third flower.

                                   - Flower 4 -

Walk left to exit the gap, and run right after landing on the floor below. Jump 
over the neabry Hootie the Blue Fish, and continue right to the end of the 
tunnel. A Wild Ptooie Pirahna will be over on the right, so don't exit the 
tunnel just yet. Instead, wait for the second plant to shoot a Needlenose 
toward you, and then eat the Needlenose to get an egg.

When Yoshi has six eggs, shoot three eggs to defeat the first Wild Ptooie 
Pirahna. Eat three more Needlenoses, and then defeat the second Wild Ptooie 
Pirahna in the same way. After the second Wild Ptooie Pirahna has been 
defeated, jump over to the platform on the right and pass through the middle 
ring.

After passing through the middle ring, walk off the right side of the white 
platform and drop into the water below. Swim left in the water to the other 
side, and jump up to the white platform to land at the start of a secret path. 
Run down the slope on the left, and stop at the bottom. Eat the Nipper Plant 
and the Aqua Lakitu on the left, and then run under the first Pirahna Plant.

Eat the next Nipper Plant and the second Aqua Lakitu when he appears from the 
water, and continue left under the second Pirahna Plant. Go down the slope in 
the tunnel to find a Hootie the Blue Fish orbiting a block. Wait for the fish 
to move to the left side of the block, and then run left to find a Caged Ghost. 
Shoot six eggs at the Caged Ghost, and jump over the small blob that remains. 
On the other side, face right toward the Caged Ghost. Eat six Shy Guys that the 
ghost spits out, and then continue left along the tunnel.

In the room with the three Hootie the Blue Fish, jump up to the first platform 
when the first fish is at the left side of the block. Jump up to the platform 
above when the second fish is above the block. Jump up to the block on the left 
when the third fish is below the block. From the block, jump up to the start of 
the path on the right, and shoot an egg at the Pirahna Plant. Shoot the winged 
up on the right to receive five stars, and then jump up to the white platform 
on the left to collect the three red coins.

Watch the Hootie the Blue Fish below. When the fish moves to the bottom of the 
block, drop down to the platform at the right side of the block. Jump onto the 
long block, and run off the right edge to drop down to the tunnel below. Run 
right along the tunnel, and stop just before the Caged Ghost, which will start 
spitting out Shy Guys. Eat the Shy Guys until Yoshi has six eggs, and then 
shoot the Caged Ghost six times. Jump over the blob, and face left.

When the Caged Ghost appears, eat six more Shy Guys, and then run right along 
the tunnel. Go up the tunnel and run under the two Pirahna Plants, and then go 
up the next tunnel and drop into the water. Swim right under the two large 
blocks, and jump up to the white platform at the right side of the second 
block. Jump over to the white platform near the tunnel entrance on the right, 
and then jump up two white platforms. Shoot an egg at the Pirahna Plant above, 
and then jump into the tunnel on the right.

Wait at the start of the tunnel for the three Paranipper Plants to drop down 
and transform into Nipper Plants. Eat the three Nipper Plants, and then enter 
the tunnel. Jump up the three white platforms, and jump into the the next 
tunnel leading right. Run along the tunnel, and stop after entering the small 
room. Shoot three eggs at the Wild Ptooie Pirahna over on the right side of the 
room, and then drop down into the room. In the room, eat the Nipper Plants, and 
then run over to the far right side of the room to collect the fourth flower.

                                   - Flower 5 -

Run left to exit the room after collecting the fourth flower, and run left 
through the tunnel. Drop down at the end of the first tunnel, and then run left 
off the white platform at the end of the second tunnel to drop down to a 
slightly longer platform below. Run right from this white platform to land at 
the start of another tunnel.

Run right through this tunnel and jump over the Hootie the Blue Fish near the 
Caged Ghost. Eat the Shy Guys that the Caged Ghost spits out until Yoshi has 
six eggs, and then return to the tunnel on the left. Face right, and wait for 
the Hootie the Blue Fish to pass by. When it does, go back to the right and 
shoot six eggs at the Caged Ghost to defeat it. Jump over the remaining blob, 
and face left on the other side. Eat six more Shy Guys when the Caged Ghost 
appears, and then run along the tunnel on the right.

When the tunnel dips drops down slightly, shoot an egg at the Pirahna Plant, 
and then continue right to the end of the tunnel to arrive near a small room. 
Eat the two Nipper Plants that bounce toward you from the white platform, and 
shoot an egg down and right into the water to defeat the Pirahna Plant. Drop 
into the water and swim right onto the block. Drop into the next small section 
of water and jump up to the higher block on the right.

A Wild Ptooie Pirahna will be down on the right, but the Needlenoses it spits 
can't hit you from the platform. Walk to the middle of the block, and shoot 
three eggs down into the water on the right to defeat the Wild Ptooie Pirahna. 
Drop down into the water on the right and jump over the block to the next 
section of water. Jump up to the white platform, and jump up again to collect 
two red coins and the fifth flower.

After collecting the fifth flower, run down the slope in the tunnel on the 
right, and wait for the three Paranipper Plants to land. Eat the three Nipper 
Plants, and then shoot an egg of the right wall so that it bounces off the 
ceiling into the red tulip. Collect the eight stars from the tulip, and then 
continue right along the tunnel to the red doors. Enter the red doors.

                       - Boss Fight 6: Naval Pirahna -

After sliding down the tunnels and landing in the water, swim right in the 
water and jump up to the far left edge of the white platform. Before Kamek 
appears, shoot the small Pirahna Plant to win the boss fight. To win the boss 
fight fairly, read below:

When Naval Pirahna puts his head down, he will start to charge toward you. Jump 
over him as he charges from right to left, and then face left. He will then 
spit out three Paranipper Plants. Wait for the plants to land, and quickly eat 
the three Nipper Plants to get three eggs.

Jump over Naval Pirahna as he charges from right to left, and then move over to 
the left side of the platform. Shoot an egg so that it bounces off the wall 
into the water, and hits the bump on the pirahna which has the 'X' on it. 
Repeat this process of jumping over Naval Pirahna when he charges and then 
hitting the bump with an egg. Hit the bump three times to defeat Naval Pirahna.
