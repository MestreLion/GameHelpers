Note, that if you've asked me for permission but don't see your site on the
list above, don't worry about it, as it's a real pain to update each time
everyone asks me to use this guide on their site. So as long as you've
asked me, yes, you can put it up on your site. The sites above are the
ones that don't have to ask to use them.

Chrono Trigger is copyright Squaresoft  1995. Please do not leech any
of this to make your own FAQ out of it. Unless you have MY permission DO
NOT take anything at all from this guide. Don't edit, don't do anything to
it and submit it without e-mailing me with permission first. You can
print it out, but only for personal use, no selling this! Summing it
up, do anything for your own personal benefit (apart from reading it)
without asking me, AND YOU'LL BURN IN HELL!!!!!
                   ---====================---
To get in touch, e-mail me at dc3131@yahoo.com.au
My ICQ# is 34601221
My webpage is http://www.dcmagus.com
My MSN contact is dcmagus@hotmail.com, but any email sent to that
   address will most likely be ignored, as I don't check that
   account
My AIM name is dcmagus

Be warned that I'm only on the net twice a week, don't expect replies
from me which are ten minutes after you've sent the mail. Here's some
guidelines about sending me mail:

1.Make sure you put the title of the game you're asking about in the
  subject. I've made a fair few FAQs, and it's a bit hard to work
  things out sometimes.

2.If it's an FAQ, make sure that it's not already in the guide!!! If
  it is, I'll do my best to ignore it.

  If it's not in there, make sure that the details you provide
  are, well, DETAILED, and not sketchy. Examples are "Hi need to know
  how to get past this part, i'm in a room and stuck", I need to know
  where you are, etc.

3.Ask nicely. So far, most people have, but if your mail goes along
  the lines of "Hi, need code for B2, reply within the next hour
  otherwise I'll bomb you" will not get you anywhere.

That's it. Sorry for being a pain, but it had to be said.

From Cosmo2-
In the triple tech section, you confused Blue Rock and Silver Rock.
The locations are correct, but Blue Rock invokes Omega Flare and
Silver Rock invokes Spinstrike.

From Teferi-
You forgot to switch the characters as well.

DC: Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Party Ratings
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 37 possible parties you can make. I'll give you the pros
and cons of each one. Instead of wasting KB, I'll put the character
descriptions here.

Ayla is very strong and fast, can steal things off enemies but her
magic is limited to damage spells, while she does have a heal spell,
but it's not too effective. Triple Kick and Dino Tail are very
useful though.

Crono is a very good attacking character, with not only his sword but
also with his magic (Lightning). There will be more than a few
situations in which you will find his various offensive spells
useful. However, that's about it, the only other spell that doesn't
deal damage is Life, but that's quite useful. If he could heal, it
would be great.

Frog is a very versatile character. He has a great selection of
Water magic, a nice attack power and he can heal when he needs to.
While the effect of Heal cancels out his Frog Squash, both are
useful when used separately. A great all rounder.

Lucca is a good offensive magic user (Fire). Most of her spells
deal damage and it's the later ones that make the difference in
battles (Flare is devastating). But her physical attack strength
isn't that good, and her non offensive magic isn't too useful.

Marle is a versatile magic user. She has healing spells, some
various effect spells, and a couple of offensive spells (Ice). You'll
be wanting her in your party for her plethora of healing spells, as
she won't do much good in the attacking department.

Magus is probably the best offensive magic user (Shadow). Not only
does he have a large selection of Shadow spells to choose from,
he also has the Fire/Ice/Lightning 2 spells, which are invaluable.
He is also a decent physical attacker.

Robo is like Frog, he's versatile all around. Not only can he cure,
he has spells that can deal a lot of damage, and he is also a great
physical attacker. When you've got spells like Uzzi Punch, Shock and
Heal Beam all on the same character, you can't lose.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Crono, Frog
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good physical attack power. Frog and Ayla can heal to some
extent, so if you're low on HP, you can turn to something other than
items. All three have some power magic spells that they can use.
But I suppose they could do with a better healer. Their triple tech
is great as it deals Shadow damage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Crono, Lucca
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Good magical strength. Ayla can heal to some extent, but I wouldn't
rely on Ayla for healing... Ayla and Crono have good physical power,
but Lucca really isn't the sort of person you'd use for attacking.
All three have their big magic spells that can really hurt. The
triple tech that these guys have is very handy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Crono, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This party is pretty good as they are strong magic wise. Crono has
good offensive magic spells and is a great attacker, Ayla is a great
attacker and has some damaging magic spells, and Marle is the best
healer in the game. Ayla and Marle can also use their Twin Charm
to good use, and the Final Kick Triple tech is pretty handy as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Crono, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This party is not only strong physically, but magically as well.
Crono and Magus will take care of all of your magic and attacking
needs, and Ayla is great with her fists as well. Just don't think
that you can really heal yourself to a point of safety by using
Ayla's weak healing spell.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Crono, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite a useful team. These guys can all attack and use their magic
well. And with Robo in, you can heal with Ayla and Robo to a certain
extent as well. Their triple tech is kind of useful, but it's not
the best triple tech there is.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Frog, Lucca
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This party's strength is in Frog's and Lucca's magic, and Frog's and
Ayla's attack power. Otherwise, they're weak at healing, and while
the magic is good, the physical attack power isn't that strong.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Frog, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite a useful party. Ayla and Frog can dish out damage physically,
while Marle can heal and damage the enemy magically. Ayla and Marle
can also use Twin Charm when needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Frog, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite a strong team offensively, as Ayla, Frog and Magus can attack
well, and Frog and Magus (especially Magus) have powerful magic
spells they can use. One downer though is that Ayla can't heal very
well, and you really need Frog to be doing something other than
healing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Frog, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A very nice team. They all pack a punch physically, and Robo's
healing spells are better than Ayla's. However, you'll mainly be
wanting Robo to get up there and smack the enemy's lights out, along
with Frog and Ayla, either magically or physically. This team can
do both.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Lucca, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's the all female team! (Cue Charlie's Angel's music). Here, the
attack power may be a little weak overall, but magically, Lucca and
Marle can really do some damage. Marle is also a great healer, so
that's one problem fixed. Use Ayla to attack, Lucca to cast her
Fire spells and then have Marle heal or use Ice spells.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Lucca, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is alright. Magus is a great offensive character magically
and physically, Lucca is great magically, and Ayla is great
physically. However, Ayla can't hea; very well so you'll need to
stock up on healing items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Lucca, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, Ayla can dish out damage physically, Lucca can cast those hot
spells, and Robo can a)dish out damage with his fists, b)cast big
spells, and c)heal when needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Marle, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A pretty good pairing. Ayla is great with her fists, Marle can heal,
and Magus absolutely canes in the magic department. The only thing
missing here is a good overall attack power.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Marle, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite evenly balanced team here. Ayla is a good attacker, Marle can
heal and do some magic damage, and Robo can heal/attack/do magic
damage. A well balanced team.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayla, Magus, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is okay. They can all deal good damage physically, and
Magus and Robo work well in the magic department. Robo can heal as
well, but you really need him to be attacking, and Ayla's healing
magic isn't that good.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Lucca
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, Crono and Frog are great attackers, and Lucca is good with her
magic, and Frog can heal to some extent, but you really want him to
be dealing damage instead of healing. However, Delta Storm is a
very handy triple tech.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a quality team. Crono and Frog can really pack a punch, both
physically and by using magic, while Marle can heal and deal some
magical Ice damage every now and then. Arc Impulse is also a great
Triple Tech.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is also quite a good team, it just lacks a quality healer. Frog
can heal, but he shouldn't be healing when he can whoop some ass.
These three are all strong magically and physically, and you should
be able to whoop some ass with this group.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very handy team to have. They are all strong physically
and can all whoop some ass magically. Robo and Frog can heal as well,
so it's more versatile than having to wait for one character's turn
all the time. And Triple Raid is very effective.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

What this party lacks is a good physical attack base, as you've only
got Crono to do that for you. However, Crono, Lucca and Marle all
have some nice elemental magic, and Marle can heal. Plus you've got
the very nice Delta Force tech.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The party would be good if Lucca was a good healer. This party is
very strong in terms of magic, decent in terms of physical attacks,
but in terms of healing, suck because there are no healers here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team can really give out a whipping by using their powerful
plethora of magic spells, and Crono and Robo are good attackers as
well. Robo is your healer here, but you really need him out there
kicking some butt instead of healing, so maybe use Lucca and some
items. Fire Zone is a decent Triple tech.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Marle, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is pretty good. Both Crono and Magus can really kick some
arse magically and physically, and Marle is there to heal and join in
the magic fest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Marle, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a pretty handy team to have. Crono and Robo are good
attackers and magic users, while Marle and Robo can heal, so if one's
not free, you've always got someone else to rely on. The triple tech
Lifeline can really save your butt in most situations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Magus, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is all power. They can all deal some great damage
physically and magically, and Robo can heal. It's hard to see you
failing with this team...but sometimes Robo can get tied up healing
instead of dealing damage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Lucca, Marle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is OK. They lack in physical attack power but they make it
up for their strength in magic. Marle is a great healer and can deal
some damage with her magic, Frog can attack and use his magic well,
plus heal if needed, and Lucca is great with Fire magic. Many of
this group's dual techs really kick butt.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Lucca, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This party is very good in the magic department, Frog and Lucca have
great Water and Fire magic, and Magus is a magic powerhouse. However,
your only healer here is Frog, and when he's healing you might be
needing him to attack or use magic, so that's a drawback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Lucca, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, this party is strong in the magic department, as all
three are capable of casting big damage spells. Frog and Robo can
also deal good damage with their weapons, and both of them can heal,
so you've always got one person to back the other up.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Marle, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very destructive team. While Marle sits back and heals
(occasionally use her Ice spells), Frog and Magus can cut sick either
physically or magically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Marle, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Kinda the same as the Frog-Lucca-Robo party, except that now you've
got three healers. You should mainly use Marle to heal, and just
attack with Frog and Robo, dipping into your magic inventory every
now and then.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog, Magus, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a power team. These three all all pretty good in physical
attacks and magic, and both Frog and Robo can heal, so you don't
have to keep relying on one person.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lucca, Marle, Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a decent team. Here, you have Lucca to use her powerful Fire
magic, Marle to heal and use her Ice magic, and Magus to attack and
use his Shadow and elemental magic. The thing that lets this team
down is that their physical attack rating isn't too good.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lucca, Marle, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This team is kinda like the one above, except this time, Robo has a
better physical attack power but less variety in magic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lucca, Magus, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very strong team. Magically, you have three very capable
characters that can hurt the enemy real bad. Physically, Magus and
Robo should be able to handle the situation. Robo can heal to some
extent as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marle, Magus, Robo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is like the team above except that now it's got a main healer,
so you don't have to worry about breaking Robo's attack pattern.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: 200g

It's morning, and your Mum is asking you to wake up...pass this
sequence, and when you are downstairs, talk to your Mum to recieve
200g. Now go outside, and I suggest you head into the Guardia Forest
(to the left) to build your levels up to about 5 or 6. You don't have
to, but it will make it easier for you later on. Once that is done,
head to Leene Square (up the top).

into money, or used at other mini-games. My suggestion is to either
keep on betting at the races (in the middle of the first screen you
enter) to get Silver Points, the top left screen to fight Gato, or
to go to the top right screen and enter the soda drinking contest.

*********************************************************************
                YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING EVENT!!!!!!
*********************************************************************

Either way, gain up some Silver Points (more than 40 will do) and
head to the tent at the right of the first screen. This is the House
of Horrors. Play the second game, and it is to copy the clone's
movements. This is vital for later on, you'll see why. Once you copy
his movements, you will acquire a clone of Crono. You'll need it if
you want to...oh, I don't want to spoil it for you.

**********************************************************************
Now you can exchange the rest of your SP for money, and if you want
you can buy a Lode Sword from Melchior, in the middle of the first
screen, as it will help a lot. Now go up, and you will bump into
Marle, your next party member. Talk to her, then pick up her pendant
and give it to her. When she asks if she can go with you, answer no.
When she asks again, answer yes. Now follow these steps:

Go to the right, and talk to the girl who is missing her cat. Go to
the left, and talk to the cat once (don't eat the stuff on the
table!!!). Lead it to the girl. Now, if anyone asks, don't convince
Marle to trade her pendant.

Go back down the bottom and talk to the girl on the fountain. Lucca
will have set up her invention, so go up and on the way, Marle will
want some candy. Just wait, and when she is done, keep on going up.
Talk to Lucca, try the machine (left pod unless you are on a super
high level, 80+) and then talk to Marle. She will try it, but
something will go wrong. Go in after her. Now if you are playing a
New Game +, you may want to enter the right pod to face Lavos
straight away! It's the quickest and hardest ending. Good luck.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
600 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Power Glove, Tonic

You'll be warped to a canyon. Go left, into a large screen. Work your
way through to the bottom, collecting two chests on the way, and exit
to the map. Head to the Market (lowest building on the right) and buy
a few Tonics, you can afford it. Then head into Guardia Castle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardia Forest/Castle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Power Tab, Shelter, Tonic, Ether, 100g,
                        Bronze Mail. For the items in Guardia Castle,
                        I suggest returning to 1000 A.D to collect
                        there first before picking them up in 600 A.D

In the castle, watch the scene and go up. Speak with the King, then
if you want to rest, go left and downstairs. If not, go right, go up
the stairs until the very top. Leave the chests alone, open them in
1000 A.D. Go and speak to the Queen, who is actually Marle. She will
disappear and then get out of here. On the way you'll meet Lucca.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cathedral
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Tonic x3, Ether x2, 100g, Revive, Naga-ette
                        Bromide, Maiden Suit, Steel Saber, Speed Belt,
                        Heal, Mid-Ether, Shelter, Defender, Iron
                        Sword

Now get out, and go to the cathedral to the left of the castle. Talk
to the nun at the top left, and they will all turn into enemies. Kill
them, and another one will appear. It will get killed by Frog, your
next party member.

Head to Guardia Forest and build up until you get the Flame Tech for
Lucca, Slurp Cut for Frog, and Slash for Crono. Now rest at the Inn
if needed, and go back to the cathedral. Go up to the organ in the
upper left, and press A to play it. A door will open up, enter it.
Here is another good place to build your levels, 7+ is sweet. First,
go to the right and pick up the treasures. Go up the stairs, enter
the room and collect the treasures, and then go to the drawers and
press "A" to collect a Naga-ette Bromide. Some enemies will rush in,
kill them. Now go up, to the left of the spikes, and press the
skull. The bucket on the left has a Magic Tab. Get it by pressing A,
and return to the bottom floor.

Don't go up the middle yet, go to the right and up the stairs. Go
into the upper door, and try to leave. Beat the enemies, and then
enter the secret door on the right wall. It will be a Magus shrine
(a shrine to me...how cool...kidding.). Pick up the treasures and
leave. You may have to battle the enemies if unlucky. Now return to
the bottom floor and go straight up into the middle door. Save, and
head up the stairs, and slide down the ones on the right. Head up,
press the skull, and go up. Keep going left, and head down twice.
Go up the stairs, grab the treasure, and head into the room you just
opened up.  Defeat the enemies, grab the treasure and play the organ.
Now go all the way around again, except there will be an opening on
the wall. Enter, go up the top, save, and enter the next room. You
will now battle Yakra.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are 7+, this is easy. Just keep on attacking, and use Crono
and Frog's X Strike. Also heal with Frog, this one is over very
quickly.

Wvyern's Tactic:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Lucca
Have Crono/Frog use X-strike and Lucca use Flame Toss.


Open the chests (the REAL chancellor is in one), and head back to
Guardia Castle. Go back up to the Queen's room to get Marle back. Go
back to the canyon where you came from, and talk to the blue thing
(a gate) to get home.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1000 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Ether x3, Mid Tonic x5+(number of guards you
                        knocked out), Shelter x2, Lode Sword, 1500G,
                        Bronze Mail

You'll land back in Leene Square. Head back to Guardia Castle. That
stupid Chancellor is at it again, and he will send you to jail. But
first, a trial. If you followed the steps I told you to follow in
Leene Square, you should get off okay. Answer the questions
truthfully, and the verdict makes no difference: you will be sent
to jail. There, the Chancellor will change the verdict to execute
you!

In the cell, if you were charged not guilty, you will have a pack
and a mug to take. The pack is an Ether, the mug is a free source of
HP/MP. Now, if you want to gain some levels (maybe) and acquire lots
of items, keep annoying the guards out front until they come in. You
will kill them both and are free to explore. Otherwise, you can wait
until Lucca saves you.

If you do get out, go free and explore. You can kill guards in one
shot by waiting until they face away from you, and pressing A. Search
their bodies for a Mid Tonic, better than beating them. Somewhere,
you will find a prisoner, help him. He will prove useful later on.
Also, there will be a path leading you outside. Scale the walls
downward to get some items. In that room, there is a black hole,
press A to climb down and receive some more items. Eventually you
will find the exit; the supervisor will give up 5 Mid Tonics if you
search him. Go out and face the Dragon Tank.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Tank
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First, aim all attacks at the head (normal attacks). Heal when needed
too. When the head is gone, start attacking the body. 8+ is a fine
level, and this is too easy.

Wvyern's Tactic:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Tank
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca
Use regular attacks on the head until it dies, then use Cyclone or
Fire Whirl.

Now you will run, with Marle, out to the Guardia Forest. Go right and
you will find a gate... go in it, and get transported to...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. When i walk into the Trann Dome in Chrono, all I can see is smoke.
Is that how it is supposed to be? It's a ROM. Would that have anything
to do with that, or is that how it looks in the SNES cart? Please
help!!!

A. No, use the 1-5 buttons on the keyboard to change the graphics
settings, it's like that. But when you take the fog off, you can't
see the text. Bummer.

From Xerain:
Rather than turning off the offeneding background using ZSNES, it is
better to change the video mode. Go under config and select video.
Put it to one of the 16B settings.
Use the 640x480x16B VESA2 setting, and if it runs slow, use the
320x240x16B VESA2 for similar effects, but lower resolution.
These are general ZSNES tips for all Roms. I am aware you may know
them (If you even use the rom, that is), but your readers may not.
If I come up with any more tips I'll be sure to let you know.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Iron Helm

The year 2300! Whoa! Head outside and to the structure below. It's
the Trann Dome. Buy what you need, rest in the Enertron. Now exit,
and go to hte upper right to reach Lab 16.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lab 16
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Lode Sword, Lode Bow, Ether, Berserker

This is full of thieving rats. So avoid them. This is a great place
to build up your levels as well....there will be chests along the
way so pick them up too. Usually the direction is to go up, if not,
to the upper right. You will exit soon, and meet another huge
structure, the Arris Dome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Arris Dome
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Mid-Ether x2

There will be lots of people surprised to see you. Use the Enertron
before going downstairs. Go to the left, and through the girder maze.
At the end, you will face the Guardian.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardian
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 9+ is sweet...just use normal attacks, maybe Crono's Cyclone
tech if needed. First, kill off the two Bits, as if you attack the
Guardian first they will all do a super move on you. Once they are
gone (it won't take long), pummel the Guardian with normal attacks.
The Bits will revive, so take them out again, and repeat once more to
kill the Guardian.

Wvyern's Tactic:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robot Dude
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle
Kill the bits with normal attacks, then concentrate on the body.
Fire/Lightning do 0 damage. Hitting the body while the bits are still
alive results in a delta counter.

Enter the door at the top. You will see a dead person, and grab some
seeds off him. Open the chest, head back to catch the rat. Hold B
down to run, and A to catch it. Once you do, it will tell you that the
passcode is L&R&A.

Go back, re-surfacing to use the Enertron if needed, and then enter
then passcode at the console with a sparkling thing on it. A passage
to the door on the right will appear, enter the door.

*********************************************************************
From Alan Berck:
Hi! I'm here just to say that you have very nice FAQ. I would like to
point out that on some emulators, the keyboard will read the L + R
then A password as the L and R repeting.To make it work, get a
joystick, joypad, any other controller with 2 buttons. then plug it
in, and setL to one button and R to another. then press all 3 in the
correct order.

From Mitchell Mebane:
I read your Chrono Trigger FAQ, it is one of the best, and I've got
a few tips for you.

You stated that many people have said that they can't push the L+R+A
sequence, at the Arris Dome in 2300 A.D. Well, the problem isn't your
ROM, it isn't your emulator (this only occurs on emulators,) it's your
KEYBOARD.I had a heck of a time with this, until I read the ZSNES
help file(ZSNES.FAQ). The problem lies in the way the PC keyboard
sends its data tothe computer. You can only press a certain number
of buttons at a time, orthe keyboard cancels out the others. A couple
ways around this are: assignthe L, R, and A buttons to one key, such
as Page Up. Then, pressing that keyenters the code. Another way is to
assign them to the Ctrl, Alt, and Shiftkeys. Since the PC keyboard
accepts any combinations of the modifier keys,this works also. The
final way, my personal favorite, is to simply use ajoystick. I've got
a Microsoft SideWinder gamepad, and it is SWEEEET! Its buttons are
almost exactly the same as the SNES gamepad. Also, you can connect up
to four SideWinder pads together, this, in combination with the
keyboard, lets you use all the players in a MultiTap game. A Gravis
eXterminator gamepad would work well, too. (I'm not sure if you can
chain them, though.)
Another way to fix this is to emulate on a Mac. The Mac keyboards
don't have this problem (at least the iMac keyboards don't.)

DC: Which means...assign L,R and A all to one key on the keyboard,
and press that to activate the door! It's so simple! (Lucky I've got a
good keyboard :-)

There's also a combo input button for ZSNES, in the Misc section I
think. Go into Misc, then Key Comb. and muck around there to figure
it out. Thanks Alan and Mitchell!!!
*********************************************************************

Fight your way through this small room, and enter the next big room.
BTW, with the Enertron nearby, this is an excellent place to build
up your levels. No crap. In the big room, work your way to the top,
more on the left side. Enter the door and you see a record of what
happened..in 1999. The destruction of the world by Lavos!!! Now
you're on a mission to stop that from happening.

Go back up to the top, and talk with Doan to recieve a Bike Key.
You'll need it to get through Lab 32 safely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lab 32
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Race Log

Go to the upper right to reach Lab 32. Inside, talk to the bike
thingy, and robots will come out. Then a racing dude will appear,
fend off the robots and challenge you to a race. This is easy, just
keep circling around him and save your boosts till the end. You can
also walk through the path instead of racing, you will gain some
levels and acquire the item which records your speed when doing the
race.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Proto Dome
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: None

Now head to the building at your lower right. Defeat all the enemies,
go up and find a robot (Robo), who will be your next party member.
Lucca will repair him and you will have to leave a character behind
(I chose to leave Lucca behind, it's up to you). Then head out and
up to the Factory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Factory
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Shelter, Hammer Arm, Titan Vest, Plasma Gun

At the Factory, use the panel in front of you. An enemy will drop
down, just use attacks to defeat it. Now go up, and to the right
elevator. Take the ladder to the lower floor, go left and grab the
Robin Bow. Now get on the conveyor belt, and get through three rooms
of enemies. Then hold down so you can get off. Go down, and up the
ladder. Go up, and to the right to pick up the chest. Go into the
door, and get the codes (B,B and X,A). Grab the chests, go out, and
into the door on the left. Get through here, and you will be at the
control panel. Enter both of those codes, and then go down the ladder
and left. Go up the door to get another code, XABY. Now return to the
entrance (you may want to go back to Proto Dome for the Enertron).

This time, go into the left elevator. Follow the path, and activate
the panel in the room with the lasers. Grab the chests, and either
go down the ladder or elevator. Enter the code, and turn the power
back on. Something goes wrong, so escape, using the ladder (elevator
doesn't work). On the way out, you'll meet Robo's "friends". They'll
beat him up, and the turn on you.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo's Pals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca/Marle (Lucca works better)
Use Fire Whirl on the center of each line. Two per line should wrap
it up.

Use Marle to heal, and use Crono's Cyclone. When they are gone, you'll
head back to the Proto Dome. Lucca will repair Robo, and then you'll
head into a gate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
End of Time
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: None

Whoa! Weird. Talk to the guy in the middle. Whenever he says "Hey",
he's got something to say. Try to leave and he'll say hey, and tell
you to go into the door above. There you'll meet Spekkio and learn
magic. You can also try to beat him to recieve some items. Once that
is done, you can either go back to your own time, or gain up lots
of levels.

To go back, go in the portal which says 1000 A.D. To build up, go
into the 65 Million B.C one, and once in there, go to the map. Go
right and when you reach the village, head to the upper right, you
will find a Hunting Grounds. Find the Nu (either at the top platform
at the bottom right, or at the top left or right, it's random). He
will take you down to 1 H.P with his attacks, but he won't kill you.
Everytime you beat him, you get like 30 tech points, and heaps of
EXP, so do this until you think you are ready to move on. Return
here often to build up.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1000 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Speed Tab, Magic Tab

Ok, barge in on someone's house...Anyway, get out and head to the
south-east, that's where Melchior's Hut is. Before you do, you may
want to look around, first in the Elder's House for some items, then
to the Market to laugh at prices higher than what Bill Gates earns.
Once you reach Melchior, he'll tell you there's a vortex which will
take you back to Truce, so head into the mountains above (Heckran
Cave).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heckran Cave
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Ether x2, Mid Ether, Magic Scarf, Taban Vest

This should be easy for any RPG gamer to get through, just that in
the middle of the cave, where you can either go into the door at the
bottom left or bottom right, go in the bottom right first to grab
some treasure, then into the bottom left. There, walk through the
water and save. Now you'll have to face Heckran. He's quite easy,
level 12-15 or so is good. Just don't hit him when he challenges
you to, otherwise he'll counterattack.


Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heckran
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle
Use Lightning and Antipode. When he says, "Go ahead and attack," wait
for a counterattack break or you'll get a waterwave down your throat.

When you beat him, jump in the whirlpool and go to into Lucca's House,
speak to Taban and take the armor. Now go to Leene Square, and warp
back to the End of Time. Now, you can either go to 600 A.D or be a
psycho like me and level up major in 65 Million B.C (Level 18?
Hmm...). Levelling up will help a lot, though. To Level 16 or 17 is
good. Once you've done that, head to 600 A.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
600 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Shelter, Ether, Jerky, Power Tab, Shelter,
                        Gold Helm

Get out of the canyon, and go downwards towards the bridge. Speak
with all of the knights there, and head up to Guardia Castle. Go
right and into the kitchen, speak with all the people there too. Now
leave and when you do, the chef will give you a Jerky. Take that to
the knights at the bridge. Make sure your party is Crono, Marle and
Lucca (with the Ice Sword and Fire Sword techs), then go across the
bridge. You will see Ozzie, and he will send skeletons after you. If
you have Lighting 2 for Crono, this should be too easy. Keep going
until you get to the end, and face Zombor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zombor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As I said, make sure you have Marle and Lucca with you. Use Fire
Sword on the lower body, and Ice Sword on the upper body. The person
which isn't required for a tech can damage the other part or heal,
and the last person to hit him will get all of their MP stolen.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zombor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle (the robot sucks!)
Use Lightning on the bottom (?) and physical attacks on the top. Heal
up, this guy's a pain.

Go to the nearest Inn, rest. If you got the Naga-ette Bromide in the
Cathedral, the north most house on the west block will contain a guy
who wants it, talk to him and then open the drawer for a Tab. Now go
east and enter the Denadoro Mountain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Denadoro Mountain
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Ether, Mid Ether x4, Revive x2, Mid Tonic x2
                        500G, 300G, 600G, Shelter, Hero Medal, Magic
                        Tab, Silver Erng, Silver Stud, Bent Sword


This should be quite easy to get through without directions, but
first, go straight up into the waterfall. There, you should acquire
a treasure of some sort. Then head back and go up the path to the
left, you'll meet Tata, the supposed "Hero". After that, head upwards
and follow the easy trail. Once you reach the two Free Lancers
standing on a waterfall, beat them, and then go down the left-hand
side of the waterfall. Hold left, you'll fall on a platform
containing treasure. Then fall to the right, pick up the treasure,
and head to the right, you'll appear on a path you just went on.

Keep going on past that part, when you reach the Kiwala (white
creature), keep talking to it for a Magic Tab. Keep going on until
you reach a cave, this is where Masa and Mune are. Before entering
though, make sure that you have Lucca in your party (with the Hypno
Wave tech).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Masa and Mune
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Hypno Wave straight away, and focus all your attacks on one
member. Fire Sword and Uzzi Punch worked well for me, this is just a
warm-up battle....

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Masa and Mune
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Robo (sigh)
Use Hypno Wave to put them out, then concentrate on one. They can't
operate apart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Masamune
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty tough. Whenever it says "storing tornado energy", use
Crono's Slash tech to get rid of it. Use one person to heal (Robo
preferably, he's got Cure Beam which cures multiple targets) while
the other two use an attack like Ice Sword or Fire Sword. Robo's Uzzi
Punch once again comes in handy here. It's hard, but it'll be over
soon.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
MasaMune
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Robo
Use Dual Techs like Fire Punch and Fire Sword (if you've got it) and
Slash when he stores his Tornado energy.

Once you've beaten them, you'll get the Masamune, and get warped
out of here. Go down to Porre, and head into Tata's Home. Get the Hero
Medal from Tata, and go into the Cursed Woods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursed Woods
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Shleter, Magic Scarf, Mid Tonic, Bent Hilt

Go all the way up to the top, and go down the bush to get into Frog's
home. Talk to him, but he won't join you. Open both of the apple like
chests to get an accesory and the other part of the Masamune.
Melchior's name will be on the sword, so visit him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Melchior' Hut
---------------------------------------------------------------------

He'll tell you you need a special stone to forge the Masamune back
together...so head to the End of Time and warp to 65 Million B.C.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
65 Million B.C
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Berserker, Third Eye

At first, you'll be attacked by a group of Reptites. Use Crono's
Lightning 2 to take care of them. More will come, and so will
somebody who will beat them up for you. Finish all the rest, and have
a conversation with Ayla (your new party member). After that, head
down the canyon, and left to find the village. Go into the meeting
site, and join the party! Keep talking to Ayla throughout it and she
will challenge you to a "game" to win the Dreamstone. It's a soup
drinking contest, have that turbo A button pressed down! After you
win, you'll kinda fall asleep, and next morning you will find out
the Gate Key is missing!

Before going after the thief, you may want to trade with the
merchant in the bottom-right most hut. You'll need the items he has,
but you need to collect Petals, Fangs, Horns and Feathers to trade.
The easiest way to collect them is to go fight the Nu at the Hunting
Range, he gives you three of each whenever you beat him. Ruby Vests
are critical for some of the bosses which you will fight later on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Item Name         Payment Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flint Edge        3 Fangs    3 Horns
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Helm         3 Feathers 3 Horns
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Gun          3 Fangs    3 Petals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Vest         3 Fangs    3 Feathers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sage Bow          3 Horns    3 Petals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stone Arm         3 Feathers 3 Petals

Once that is done, go south into the Forest Maze.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forest Maze
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Mid Tonic x3, Revive x2, Mid Ether x2, Heal,
                        Shelter

First, you'll meet Kino and have a short conversation. For a maze,
this is easy. Grab all the chests you can see, and if your'e stuck
at any point, search for a vine or a ramp which will take you
lower/higher. Once you get to the very bottom of the screen, first
go up to collect the treasure before exiting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Reptite Lair
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Mid Ether x2, Full Tonic x2, Rock Helm, Ruby
                        Vest, Full Ether

In this place, drop down the holes to get from room to room. Soon
you'll reach a big room with a Reptite guarding some treasure. The
room after that has a path which leads left, unless you want to go
back to the start, avoid that path and head straight. Soon you'll
meet Azala. Whatever you respond won't make a difference, you'll have
to fight Nizbel. I suggest having Robo and Marle in your party.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you'll need to shock Nizbel with Crono's Lightning to
deal any decent damage to him. Then whack him with Ice Sword, Ice
Sword 2 if possible, and use Robo to heal or use Uzzi Punch.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Whoever
Stun him w/Lightning and kill him, it's not rocket science.

After the battle, Azala will hand you back your key. Then you'll
appear back in the village, and say goodbye to Ayla. Head back to
the time gate and warp to 1000 A.D, Medina Village.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1000 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Masamune

Go to Melchior's hut and show him the Dreamstone. He'll take one of
your other members downstairs to fix it. It won't take too long,
just don't talk to them. Once the Masamune is fixed, take it to Frog.
Finally, he'll join you. Now back to the End of Time so that Frog
can learn magic, and take him back to the Hunting Grounds in 65
Million B.C to gain some levels, and if your'e good enough, to get
Water 2.

After that, take Marle into your party and go to 600 A.D, east of
the Denadoro Mountain to find the Magic Cave. Enter the Magic Cave,
and Frog will use the Masamune to get through. Pass through this
very easy section and read the soldier's note, something about
Juggler's in Magus' Lair. Then head out, and up into Magus' Lair.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus' Lair
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Mid Ether x4, Shelter x2, Barrier x2, Magic
                        Tab x2, Mist Robe x2, Slasher, Dark Mail,
                        Revive, Speed Belt, Magic Scarf, Doom Finger

Whoa...Magus' Lair! That's where I got the name of my website from
(shamless plug coming up), please visit it at http://jump.to/magus
:-)

Go inside, and go to the left corridoor first. Go up, collecting all
the treasure on the way, and then go to the right and do the same.
Something strange is going on... a save point will appear in the
middle of the entrance hall. Step on it, and that fat bastard Ozzie
will appear. He'll say something about defeating all 100 of his
monsters. If you think he's lying, I dare you to count all of them.
Defeat his henchmen and then go back into the left corridoor. Go up,
fighting enemies if you want, and soon you'll meet Slash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Slash
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Damn, he's got Crono's techs! The easiest way to kill him is to use
Arc Impulse (a triple tech, requires Crono's Spincut, Frog's Leap
Slash and Marle's Ice 2) if your three characters aren't hurting. If
they are, use either Frog or Marle to cure, and use a dual tech (if
it's Frog, X-Cut, if it's Marle, Ice Sword 1 or 2). Once you defeat
him, he'll attack again, use the same tactic.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Slash
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Robo
Triple Raid and you'll be rewarded with his nifty sword.

Pick up the Slasher, and then use a shelter at the save point. Then
head to the left corridoor, and talk to the kids surrounding the
treasure. They'll turn into Shadows, easily fried by Lightning 2
(or any other level 2 elemental spell). Grab the treasure and head
up. You'll fight Flea...rather a fake Flea. Be careful, whoever hits
him/her will have their MP drained. Then you'll be taken into battle
with the real Flea.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flea
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ouch. She/he's quite hard, as she/he (I'll just call Flea it) keeps
using status changing spells (Chaos, Sleep). This time use Frog and
Crono's techs (Spire, X-Strike) and use Marle for healing and
recovery. It will take a while.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flea
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Robo
Be careful! This chick/dude uses status-effecting magic. Store up on
the Heals and Triple Raid or X-strike whenever possible. She doesn't
have much HP.

Now go back to the main entrance. You can either head back to where
Slash was to save and restore, or just go on the teleporter in the
centre. Once you do, follow the path until you reach Ozzie.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozzie
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Extremely easy, just don't hit Ozzie! Instead move the cursor around
to target the switch chain thingies. Hit all four of those targets
and you'll win.

The right save point is a save point, the left one a teleporter. Head
into the teleporter, follow the stairs and then enter Magus' inner
sanctum, which looks extremely cool. Head into battle with him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is very hard. He keeps on changing barriers, and whatever magic
he casts is the type you have to use against him. I still used Crono,
Frog and Marle in my party. Attack him with Frog to change his
barrier, and use your most powerful type of magic on him. When he
risks casting a spell, quickly fire up Arc Impulse (Triple Tech), and
then after he casts it get ready to cure. Use Marle and Frog to cure
(Double Cure is great) and then repeat the process over again.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Marle
This is by far the hardest boss yet. Hit him repeatedly with the
Masamune, and wait for his barrier to switch to Water. Then, use Ice
Water, Ice Sword, and Swordstream to bring his HP down. When he starts
casting a spell, hit him with physical attacks until he casts Dark
Matter, then heal up and do it again. He'll die eventually, i promise.

Once you beat him, something will happen, dragging all of you into a
gate...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
65 Million B.C
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, your'e back in Ayla's place...after a few events take place,
Kino runs in and says that the North Ruins are on fire. Head there,
and listen in on Ayla's conversation. After that, get some new items
at the trading hut.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Item Name         Payment Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aeon Blade        3 Fangs    3 Horns
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream Bow         3 Horns    3 Petals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream Gun         3 Fangs    3 Petals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magma Hand        3 Feathers 3 Petals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Helm         3 Feathers 3 Horns
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Vest         3 Fangs    3 Feathers

Now head up to the Dactyl's Nest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dactyl's Nest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Mid Tonic, Mid Ether, Meso Mail

The enemies here give you some nice amounts of EXP, so level up if
you want. Follow the path, which is usually go up a ladder, around,
up a ladder again... and you'll reach the top soon. Ayla will be
there, with some Dactyl's. Take Frog and Marle out, and add Robo to
your party. Then fly south, and into the Tyrano Lair.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tyrano Lair
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Full Ether x2, Full Tonic, Mid Ether, Tonic,
                        Revive, Cera Topper, Meso Mail

Head in and go down the stairs on the right. Find Kino and follow him
back upwards. He'll open the left path. Get through the easy castle,
using switches (usually skull heads) to get through. Most of the time
you'll have the switch in a room on the right, and it will open up
the door in the middle. There'll be a room coming up with two switches,
and if you press them, monsters fall from the sky =) Exit to the
right. Soon you'll reach a very annoying teleport room, where most
tiles take you to another place in that room. Teleport around to grab
the treasure, then exit via the stairs. Now, fight Nizbel 2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy, just use Lightning like you did with the first Nizbel and
Twister (Triple Tech) if you have it. Follow the steps you did to
take care of Nizbel one and you'll be fine.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Frog
Use physical/lightning techs like Spire and Volt Bite. Charm for a
3rd Eye.

After the battle, go outside. There's three switches on the floor,
the top switch is a save point, the left switch makes the floors open
and the right switch summons enemies to battle with you. Enter the
skulls' mouth for a chest, then head in the middle door. Soon, you'll
reach a bridge which leads outside, change Robo with Lucca. Fight
Azala and the Black Tyrano.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Tyrano/Azala
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First, concentrate everything on Azala. Fire Sword 2 works very well
here. Once he's done, just attack the Tyrano until he says "Removing
Defense". He'll start counting down, whack him with everything you
have until he reaches 0. Heal, and repeat the process again.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Azala&Black Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Frog
Arm Fire armor, if available. Use magic on Azala till she dies, then
wait for the Black Tyrano to lower its defense. Attack it with your
most powerful techs, and brace yourself for the flame attack it uses
when the counter hits 0. It also bites you to steal HP.

Lavos falls to the Earth...and the Tyrano Lair is gone. Go into the
crater which is left, and enter the gate. Which will take you to..

---------------------------------------------------------------------
12000 B.C
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Black Rock, Magic Tab

Reality aside, I think this place looks cool! With all the palaces
and so forth...plus they have some pretty cool music. If I could
live somehwere, it would be here...but enough said, let's get on with
it!

Get out of the cave you are in and head east. Enter the Skyway and
stand on the teleporter to be taken to Zeal, the floating continent.
Sounds like FF3. Anyway, go into the first palace there, Enhasa.
Inside will be three books on tables scattered around the place. You
have to open these elemental books in this order: Water, Wind, Fire.
Water is on the right side of the room, Wind at the top, and Fire near
the entrance. Change your party to Crono, Frog and Marle. Go into the
door which just opened up, near the Fire book. Inside are six Nu's,
beat them by using your second level elemental spells (Lightning 2,
Water 2, Ice 2) and if you have them, use Glacier (Frog and Marle'
dual tech) to really hurt them. You'll get heaps of EXP and two tabs.

If you need to heal find the healing circle (there's one in each
palace), and then head to the next Skyway. Go in, and when you get
out, go west to reach another Skyway, which will take you to the
other side of the Floating Continent. Enter the palace of Kajar and
do the same with the books, although I've forgotten the locations of
them it should be easy :-). A door will open somehwere, go in and
grab the Black Rock from the Poyozo Doll.

Get out, and go in the caves until you reach the main castle. Here,
find the healing circle (should be to the left somewhere) and speak
to the person with the sapling, and tell her to grow it. Do this if
you want to get the *best* ending. Then go to the upper right doorway
and into the room where Janus and Schala are. After the guard comes,
follow Schala, only to find out you can't open the sealed door with
Marle's pendant. Go to the left, speak to the sleeping Nu to get
through, and then go up to the Mammon Machine. Press A to charge the
pendant, then go and open the door you couldn't before.

Before heading on further, put Lucca, Crono and Frog in your party.
Have them all equip Ruby Vests, and then continue on. You'll meet
Dalton, who will summon a Golem to get rid of you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem
---------------------------------------------------------------------

With this trick, this is easy. Whatever attacks you do are what it
does, so just use Fire attacks (see the purpose of the Ruby Vests?),
mainly Fire Sword 2. Use Frog to Heal. But if you win or lose, you
still get captured.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever
Good luck, you'll need it. You don't have to kill it, but it really
helps in the EXP. department. It copies attacks, physical being the
worst, so don't hit it. Change up elemental magic attacks as quickly
as possible, because you have a short gap between when it copies and
when it attacks.

Watch the nice little scene that goes on. But what's not nice is
that the Prophet sends you back to where you came from. 65 Million
B.C. Damn, you can't even get back in! So head to the End of Time,
and talk to the old guy. He'll tell you to go to 2300 A.D, where
there are heaps of doors just like the one you opened in 12000 B.C.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2300 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Full Ether x2, Power Tab, Hit Ring, Elixir,
                        Wallet, Charm Top, Gold Stud, Gold Erng, Magic
                        Tab, Lumin Robe

Open up the doors with the seals in Bonger Dome, Trann Dome and the
Arris Dome. You should pick up some extremely cool items, including
the Gold Stud (MP use cut by 75%! Sweet!). So don't miss out. When
you've picked them up, head to the Sewer Access, just below Lab 16.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sewer Access
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: 600G, Rage Band, Bolt Sword

The enemies here are extremely easy, and so shouldn't need too much
help here. There will be a piss easy boss on the way through, one
shot can kill him. Go through, and exit via the ladder. Then head to
the Keeper's Dome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeper's Dome
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Epoch

Ok, there's a weird ass Nu hanging around, talk to him and then go
to the north door. Inside, read all of the shiny things to read notes
on Balthasar and his creation. Once you get around, you'll see his
creation...the Wings of Time/Epoch! The Nu will come around, ask you
to give it a name, tell you the controls, and after that, off you
go!!! Just whatever you do, don't go to 1999 A.D unless you want to
face Lavos. Now remember those seals? There's a few chests just like
that, so let's head back to 600 A.D and grab them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
600 A.D-1000 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Blue Mail/Vest, Red Mail/Vest, White Mail/Vest,
                        Black Mail/Vest, Power Ring.

There are chests in these locations:

Truce Inn
Guardia Castle
Porre Elder's House
Guardia Forest
Magic Cave

Head to all of these locations and open the chests. If it says,
"Something inside is reacting, do you want to take it out" say no.
You'll get something better in the future. This is what I mean when
I say "upgrading". Now warp to 1000 A.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1000 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things you can collect: Safe Helm, Swallow

Go to all of those locations to pick the chests up, but there is no
Magic Cave. However, there is the Heckran Cave, where there will be
some chests for you. Also, head to the blue thingy (Forest Pyramid)
above Medina to grab one of two chests. One contains a really good
helm, the other a pretty crappy weapon. Take the Helm, which I believe
is on the left. Also, put Lucca in your party, and visit her home.
Talk to Taban to recieve some armors for her. Now head back to
600 A.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
600 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the chests which you said no to. Open them now to recieve a
weaker type of armor than what you got in 1000 A.D. And then head to
12000 B.C.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
12000 B.C
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Power Tab

Go west and enter the Terra Cave. It's the home of the Earthbound
Ones, as opposed to the Enlightened Ones. Don't buy weapons yet, you
need more money. Go down to the bottom and right. Put Ayla in your
party, and either Marle or Lucca. Go up until you reach the Imp and
the Beasts. Fight them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Imp and Beasts
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Ayla's Charm to steal a pretty sweet helm from the Beasts. Now
use Fire on the Red Beast, Ice on the Blue. If you don't have them,
use Lightning or some attacking techs. After you beat them, use Rock
Throw on the Imp and it's all over.


From Ryan Ham:

Hi,
Your walkthru is great, really helping me.  One thing though, on the
part just before The mountin of Woe, about the beasts and the imp.  You
said to use fire on the red, and ice on the blue, I used fire on the red,
ad it did 0 damage, when I used fire on the blue, it did at least 500
damage.  I think you got those two mixed up.

Head back to heal, then go up into the Mountain of Woe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mountain of Woe
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Shield x2, Barrier x3, Lapis x2, Full Ether x2,
                        Lode Vest, Lode Helm, Time Hat, Shelter,
                        Ruby Knife

This is a top notch place to gain levels. Put Ayla and the person
whose levels and techs you want to build up in your party. There will
be these enemies called the Rubble who only appear once. They will
lock your party down (no techs or items), but with Ayla you can kick
it's arse easily. It gives you 100 tech points, so that's sweet.
Also, you can steal great weapons here, better than you can buy at
Terra Cave.

Explore this area carefully, it should be easy for you to grab
everything. The exits are in the northwest corner for the first
screen, at the very far east for the second, northeast for the next
one and in this screen, there are no enemies, just some stuff. Put
Ayla and Robo in your party. Go north to face Giga Gaia.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giga Gaia
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this quite easy. First, he'll deal some damage, cure with
Robo and Ayla. Then use your most powerful attacks (Luminaire,
Shock) to get rid of the arms. Dual and Triple techs are great too.
Once the arms are gone, pummel the body. The arms should come back,
rinse, lather and repeat.

Hey... what the hell is Melchior doing here? Anyway, the Mountain
will collapse, so get back to the Terra Cave. You'll have a
conversation which involves that Dalton guy coming in and doing
something, along with Janus and Schala. After that, talk to Melchior
to recieve a Ruby Knife, which will help destroy the Mammon Machine.
Get out of here, go east to the Skyway and back up into the
Enlightened World, into Zeal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeal
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: None

Go into the Mammon Machine's room. You'll find out it's been moved.
So head into the main/middle corridoor, and at then end you'll find
Dalton.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton
---------------------------------------------------------------------

He's too easy. Almost the same as Golem, you should just pound him
with phyiscal attacks and your most powerful magic spells.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Ayla
He's easy, just smack him with powerful techs. He counterattacks
with Iron Orb.

After that, you can go back and heal on the healing circle, or just
head right into the gate. Which leads to the Ocean Palace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ocean Palace
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Aeon Suit, Rune Blade, Star Sword, Shock Wave,
                        Aeon Helm, Demon Hit, Elixir, Sonic Arrow,
                        Kaiser Arm

Okay, before venturing forth, here's a word of advice. Put Crono,
Lucca and Marle in your party. The enemies here are usually Scouts,
and there are three types: Blue, Red and Yellow. You can only use
Ice on the Blue, Fire on the Red and Lightning on the Yellow otherwise
they will heal themselves. Second, you'll most certainly come across
and Jinn and Barghest, kill the Barghest first as it is easier to
kill the Jinn then.

Save, talk to Masa (or Mune?) and then head into the room below you.
The way to go is into the south door, but you want to pick up some
nice treasure. The SW and SE rooms yield some nice items. When going
into the SW room, follow the left edge around to the bottom, and
then keep going right to reach a secret treasure chest. Watch out
and pick up all the treasures, they're awesome.

Once that's all done, go back into that first room and use the south
exit. Save, and then go down the stairs. There will be lots of hard
enemies and large groups of them too, so don't hesistate to use your
best spells. Follow the path all the way down, and you'll find Mune
(or Masa? Probably Mune). Go into the next room and save (use a
shelter, trust me). Then head onto the elevator, and use the
sparkling tab to get down. There are lots of enemies here, use your
best attacks (Delta Force may work nicely).

Once you are at the bottom, go up, and either to the east or west.
Destroy all the enemies in these rooms, pull the switch on the wall
and then repeat for the other room. A walkway in the middle will
open up, cross it. Save and shelter, and then make your party as
Crono, Marle and Frog. Equip the party with Ruby Vests, or things
which protect against Fire. Go up, and face the Golem Twins.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem Twins
---------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Ruby Vests, this is easy. Use Fire Sword 2, Frog to Heal and
occasionally Leap Slash. There! That's all to it.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GolemTwins
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, your most magic-resistant character.
Arm Crono and Frog with White Mail/Vest and open up with Lightning2,
then concentrate on each Golem with Spire to chew away the HP. The
third person, unless it's Ayla, should simply sit there and heal
themselves so they can gain EXP. If it's Ayla, you can use Volt Bite.

Ok, unequip Crono of the good things he has. Trust me. Go forward,
and up to the Mammon Machine. Crono will use the Ruby Knife, no, the
Masamune, and chaos will rule. You'll now face Lavos. If you want to
beat him, go ahead, if not, read on.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't matter.
You're gonna die.

Everyone will "die", and the Prophet will come along, revealing
himself to be the great Magus!!! He'll face Lavos but get his powers
drained. Crono will then wake up, go up to Lavos and press A. Then
Lavos and Crono will disappear, the "Floating Continent" will sink
into the sea, and tidal waves whack the crap out of everyone below.
Whoops.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Last Village to the Blackbird
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: None

You'll wake up without Crono. Now pick three people in your party
(put Ayla in your party though) and head to the Commons. Dalton will
show up after you talk to the Elder, and capture you and your Epoch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blackbird
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Your own stuff back

Whoo....you've been captured. Now head up the ladder and climb it.
The air ducts are your way to travel. Press A on top of the lights
to look down. Head to a ladder somewhere near the top left corner
to reach one of your member's equipment. Now use an exit to get out,
and start rampaging around everywhere, entering all the rooms to
search for your items.

If you have Ayla, head south to the door and pretend to be sick.
The guard will come and Ayla will smack him good. Go out, and left into
the room with your money. Exit, go north, and you'll find two doors,
enter the left one, and take your items back. Exit, go north and climb
the ladder, into the ducts. Move all the way east, south, east, then
north. Head west, and climb down the ladder, to get one person's
equipment back. Exit this room via the south door, head east, enter
the door and get another character's euqipment. One more. Climb the
nearby ladder, into the ducts, head west, south at the crossroads,
south again at the crossroads, then west, and climb down the ladder to
pick up the last chest. Exit the room and move north.

You'll enter a new screen soon, the room on the left has a ladder
leading up to the deck. The Turrets here use Lock All on you, but
when you kill them you get heaps of tech points and EXP. Sweet. Get
to the end, and you'll face a Golem Boss.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem Boss
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Just attack it. He can't hurt you.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GolemBoss
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever's on the Blackbird.
Hit him as hard and as fast as you can, because he never attacks and
eventually gets away. He's worth a nice chunk of EXP.

You'll see Dalton flyling below. You'll jump down and fight him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use all that you have, even though he's damn easy, it makes it
quicker. He'll call Golem Boss, but he's gone.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton Plus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Blackbird folks.
He uses opposite magic attacks on you, and a Slash-like attack, along
with Iron Orb. Not too tough.

Oh no, Epoch out of control!!! Follow the commands and you'll land
back in the Commons. From here, head to the North Cape (which is
north). Go to the shimmering dot and touch it to meet Magus. Here,
you can either get him in your party or fight him. I strongly suggest
getting him, as he has all elemental magic and VERY good shadow magic!
Now he tells you that the Guru of Time can bring Crono back to life.
So head in your Epoch (now controllable!) and fly to the End Of Time.
The Black Omen will rise up, ignore it until the very end. BTW,
always keep Magus in your party from this point onward.

If you didn't want Magus to join...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This will be one of the toughest battles yet. The secret here is to
use Ice 2 and Cure 2 as often as you can, as Ice 2 deals the most
damage and Cure 2 heals you up fully. Whenever the great one attacks,
retaliate with Ice 2, then wait to see how much his next hit does
before killing you. Of course, if you get down below 200 HP, heal.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog alone, or three others.
This is an optional battle, and I suggest you don't fight it if it's
your first time through the game. Magus will join you if you spare him,
and his Dark Matter attack is oh so sweet. But if you do choose to
battle him, use Frog, and forget the Masamune. Use a Bravesword if
you've got one. Wear magic-absorbing armor (doesn't matter what, he
uses everything equally it seems) and equip the Frenzy Band. It works
beautifully.

After the battle, pick up the Amulet, and he'll blabber on about the
End of Time, and how the Guru can help you bring Crono back...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
End of Time-2300 A.D
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Chrono Trigger

Get to the End of Time, and talk to the Old Man, who is actually the
Guru of Time! Go to Spekkio so that Magus can learn Shadow magic,
and then try to leave. The Old Man (Gaspar) will talk to you about
the Chrono Trigger, and how to use it to bring Crono back. But
bringing Crono back is a sub-quest, and is not neccessary although
I recommend you do it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquests
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Purely optional, but these quests are damn worth it. And always keep
Magus in your party, not only because he's good, but so he can learn
his Shadow magic faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 1: Saving Crono
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Head to 1000 A.D and pick up the clone of Crono at his house (I told
you you would need it!) and then head to 2300 A.D, to the Keeper's
Dome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeper's Dome
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: None

Talk to the Nu. It will execute a program, sending three dolls to
help you on your way through Death Peak. After that, turn him off,
and head outside and into the mountain to reach Death Peak. A
suggested party is Robo, Magus and Frog.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Death Peak
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Magic Ring, Vedic Blade, Wall Ring,
                        Memory Cap, Giga Arm, Brave Sword, Star
                        Scythe, Dark Helm

The three dolls here will aid you on your journey. In the first
screen, RUN to the first doll and speak to it. It will turn into a
tree, hide behind it until the wind dies down. Keep repeating this
process, remembering to always run otherwise you will get blown off.

Now explore your way through, and you will reach a flat area with a
save point. Save, then head into the left cave. You'll face a Lavos
Spawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Spawn
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DO NOT HIT THE SHELL! It will kick the crap through you if you do.
Aim all attacks for the head (Uzzi Punch, Leap Slash and Dark Bomb).
It will go soon, and there are three of these on the mountain.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Spawn
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Ayla, Marle
Charm it's head for an Elixir and use Cat Attack and regular attacks
on the head. Hitting the shell will result in a nasty needlespin
counterattack.

Go up, to the right, and re-enter the cave. Go down, hit the switch,
then head back to the Save Point. Save of course, then head up
through the middle, and when you are outside again, you'll face
another Lavos Spawn.

Go left, in this screen there will be a doll who says that it's very
slippery or something like that. My advice? Run across the ledge,
as fast as you can. Or you'll end up back at the Save Point. In the
next screen, head down into the next screen and reach the last doll.
I've forgotten what it said, but go down and kill the Spawn, and
push the shell up to the ladder you can't reach so you can climb it.
Up the top of the ladder, enter the next screen, go up the top and
watch a sequence, and you'll have Crono back! Yay! Now you'll arrive
at the End Of Time, talk to Gaspar and everyone but Crono to learn
more about the subquests.

"In the middle ages, a woman's sheer determination brings a forest
back to life" - Subquest 2

"A fugitive in the Middle Ages, Ozzie, maintains an evil
hideout" -Subquest 3

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 2: Reviving the Dead Forest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Lapis x2, Aeon Suit, Full Tonic, Hyper Ether,
                        Aeon Helm, Muscle Ring, Memory Cap, Full
                        Ether, Power Tab, Green Dream

In 12000 B.C, you talked to the woman about planting the seed,
right? Go to 600 A.D and to the continent where Porre is. There will
be a house and a whirlpool in the middle. Go into the house, speak
with Fiona and Marco, then put Marle, Frog and Magus as your party.
Head into the whirlpool.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whirlpool
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of treasure here...and enemies. Hold run to get most of them.
Head down one screen, and catch Retinite to fight it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Retinite
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Ice or Water magic on the bottom first, as it lowers it's
defense. Then attack it with all you have, and repeat with the top.
Keep curing, don't forget, and Leap Slash is handy here. Don't use
any other magic spells.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Retinite
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Frog, Crono
Kill the core with Confuse and use Ice/Water to destroy the leg/body
defense. Then use Confuse and alternate from Magus to Frog weakening
its defense. Cast spells between every Confuse and it'll drop like a
fly.

After this, grab the rest of the treasure and put Robo in your party.
Speak to Fiona, then leave him with her. Go to 1000 A.D and into the
shrine to pick up Robo. BTW, one of the nuns sells good defense items.

Go out, and you'll appear in a camp. You'll discuss something, and
you'll have control of Lucca. Go right and into the red gate. you'll
be in her room, go down the stairs and into the main room. Her mum
will be there, go to the white panel and enter L,A,R,A to stop her
from dying. Half-dying. It doesn't matter if she dies or not. Go
back into the Gate, you'll meet Robo and grab the Green Dream
(whenever you die, you regenerate. Once).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 3: Ozzie's Fort
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that green fat piece of crap? Well, he's still around in
600 A.D. Dump Ayla, Magus and probably Robo in your party, and go to
his fort. It's on an island in 600 A.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozzie's Fort
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Full Ether, Magic Tab, Sight Cap, Dash Ring,
                        Magus' Best Equipment

Head in and Ozzie will see Magus. And run. So follow him, and soon
you'll have to face Flea Plus. It's not really a boss, just whack
him and he'll run after a short while. Next is a screen with monsters
which just come and leave as fast as they came. You'll understand.
After that, you'll face Super Slash. Just attack him as fast as you
can.

After that, you'll be in a room with Ozzie and a treasure chest.
Ignore it, and head to the exit. An Imp will try to take it but die.
Ozzie will run. Grab the chest, and before exiting, go to the very
right wall and go down to reach a secret room with Magus' best
equipment. Now go out and face Ozzie, Flea and Slash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozzie, Flea and Slash
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't go for Ozzie! They'll do a triple tech on you. First, Charm an
item off each of them, then pound either Flea or Slash (Flea is who
I went for) and then the other will run, leaving just Ozzie to beat.
Use Shadow magic, Uzzi Punch and your other stronger techs.

Head up to meet Ozzie again. Hit the switch, fall down, and then
just head back into the room. A cat will come in and make Ozzie fall
down a pit.

If you go to Medina Village in 1000 A.D, everything is cheapo!!! Go
there to stock up on items and etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 4: A Ghost Named Cyrus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Toma's Pop, Tools, Hyper Ether, Elixir, Siren,
                        Valkerye, Shiva Edge, Kali Blade, Nova Armor,
                        Moon Armor, Magic Tab

Go to 600 A.D, the Choras village, and go in the Cafe. Talk to the
person drinking beer, and Toma. Then go to 1000 A.D, and to Toma's
Grave. Go behind the tombstone, press A, then go in front of it and
press A. He'll tell you the location of the Rainbow Shell (another
quest).

Now go to the Cafe and talk to the beer drinker who will say you
can borrow his tools. Go into a house nearby and talk to his wife
to get the tools. Go to 600 A.D and give the tools to the guy in
the Cafe. Go to his house and they will get to work at the Northern
Ruins.

Go to it, and defeat all of the monsters but don't open any chests.
Then go back and let them repair it again, at a cost of 2000g. Then
go back to the ruins, to the west wing and into the door there.
You'll get the Masamune upgraded when you speak to the grave.

Go back to the carpenter, he'll fix the rest of it up. Now go
through, not opening any chests but still talk to them. If they
say "something inside is reacting" answer "no" and continue on. Once
you've seen everything, go to 1000 A.D and open all of the chests
here. Then go back to 600 A.D to collect them again.

Now put Frog in your party, head to the Denadoro Mountains in
600 A.D. Go through again until you reach a part where a Free Lancer
is throwing rocks at you, Frog will catch one and it will turn into
a Gold Rock.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 5: The Sun Stone
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Sun Stone/Moon Stone, Wondershot, Sun Shades

Go to 65 Million BC and into the trader's hut. Get a Ruby Armor,
equip that, the Red Mail and Red Vest on your party. If you don't
have them, just equip Ruby Armors. Now go to 2300 A.D and find the
Sun Palace (talk to Lucca at the End Of Time to see what it looks
like). Enter and face the Son of Sun.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Son of Sun
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's like roulette. Only use physical attacks, no magic. You can't
hit him, only the fireballs around him. But only one of them is the
right one, the one which will deal damage to him. So it's a matter
of guess and whack as fast as you can before he spins them around.
With the Red/Ruby Armor/Vests it should be easy, as if you guess
wrong he'll do a Fire attack which your armor will defend. Otherwise,
if you hit the right one, go nuts and rush it.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Son of Sun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Crono, Frog
Arm Red Mail/Vest/Armor, you'll need it. Use Black Hole to off some
of the flames. It's a guessing game, pick the right flame with a
normal attack and it'll hurt him. Pick the wrong one and he'll
counterattack. Hit him and he'll counterattack with Flare, the most
powerful Fire type spell in the game. So don't do that.

After that, go up, and collect the Moon Stone. Head to 65 Million
BC, and find the Sun Keep (on an solitary island). Place the Moon
Stone there, and go to 2300 A.D, and into the Sun Keep. The stone's
gone. Go to the Keep in 600 A.D. It's there. So head into 1000 A.D,
and to Porre. There'll be a sparkling house, go into it and talk to
all of the liars. Go to the Snail Stop, buy the Jerky, and head to
600 A.D. Enter the house and GIVE the Jerky to the woman. Now back in
1000 A.D, the house will still sparkle but the guy will give the
stone to you. Place it back in the Sun Keep, then go to 2300 A.D to
get it back as the Sun Stone (you have to have Lucca in your party).

Now go to Lucca's House in 1000 A.D, she and her dad will forge the
Wondershot (a weapon for herself) and the Sun Shades (attack up by
1/4...sweet).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 6: Where Machines Originated
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Magic Tab x2, Vigil Hat, Lapis, Megaelixir,
                        Full Ether, Crisis Arm, Terra Arm

Put Robo in the lead of your party and go to the Geno Dome in 2300
A.D. Enter, talk to the machine and you will get access to the Geno
Dome. Now put the characters you want to level up in now, as this
conveyor belt is a top-notch place to build up your levels. Once that
is done, go right. If you talk to the sparkling thing it will ask
you if you want to go down the chute. Do this repeatedly to gain
lots of levels (you end up back at the entrance).

Right in front of you is a pod, press the switch to open it (for
purposes later on). Go to the west , and fight the two enemies there.
But don't go up that path, instead head to the one next to it.
You'll see a computer and some enemies, kill them. Talk to the
computer to grab some info. Next open up the pod nearby, it's a
charging station. Then go to the door on the left, and go up. Hit
the left and rightmost switches, then go back to the charging station
next to the computer. Stand in it until you have this thing wrapped
around you, then RUN to the pod below the switches. You'll open the
door, go in and grab the doll.

Get charged again and RUN to the pod above the entrance. Go in the
door that opened up and grab the treasure (plus 50000G!!) Now go
around and up on the conveyor belt, watch the robot at the top. Then
go back, enter the first room for some treasure and some enemies.
The other room is an elevator, get in there. Once out, you can head
south for a save point. Then go to the door in the north wall, and
go through the passage. There will be a voice speaking to you...
anyway, go up, defeat the enemies, and go into another elevator.

You're back in the main room. Go left just like the robot did and
hit the switch there to change the direction of the conveyor belt.
Then go back and down. Hit the laser switch, and then go back to get
charged. Now RUN as fast as you can, back to the conveyor belt, and
into the remaining pod. You'll open the door, grab the treasure and
make the robot follow you back to the place where you killed the two
enemies when you first entered this main room. Then go up, and place
the robot in front of the other to short-circuit them. Grab
everything and go back to the elevator. Go up, and save. Equip Robo
with the best things you have, and go west. You'll see his girlfriend,
Atropos, and you'll have to fight her with just Robo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Atropos
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use either Area Bomb or Uzzi Punch and you've got this one in the
bag. Don't forget to heal.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AtroposXR
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo
I hate Robo and I never use him, and I pay for it now because he
knows Heal Beam. Here's how you beat Atropos with this crappy robot.
Arm the Black Mail to absorb her Laser Spin attacks, your best Hand
and Safe Helm if you've got it, and a Frenzy Band. Works perfectly;
you might have to heal up with the beam thingy if you don't have the
Safe Helm. You're rewarded with her ribbon, which ups his Speed by 3
and Mg. Defense+10.

Run at the switch in the wall above you with Robo, it'll open and
let you in. Then go out and to the west, climb down the ladder,
into the door, through the east and pick up the treasure. Then head
back up, and continue going straight. You'll fight some Laser Guards,
and when they are all gone put the dolls on the green switches, go
forward and fight the Mother Brain. BUT before that put Robo, Crono
and Magus in your party.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mother Brain
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, full on attacks, nothing else. Use Shock, Luminaire and
Lightning 2/Dark Mist. Don't stop to heal or anything, because it's
just too easy. BTW, don't worry about the two side computers, one
Shock or Luminaire can take 'em out.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mother Brain and Display
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo, Magus, Ayla
Charm the Mother Brain for Blue Mail and use a 2nd level element
spell to knock out the Displays, then kill the Mother Brain with
your best techs. You'll get the Terra Arm (Robo's best weapon) and
the Crisis Arm (which sucks but is said to do 9999 damage on a
critical hit; never seen it myself).

When she's dead, you'll get some weapons. The dome will close down
pernamently, and that's it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 7: The Rainbow Shell
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Power Tab x3, Full Ether, Sight Cap, Blue
                        Rock, Lapis, Mid Ether, Frenzy Band

While doing subquest 4, you should have spoken to Toma, right? He
showed you the location of the Giant Claw, a cave which holds the
Rainbow Shell. Head to it in 600 A.D.

Enter, read the note, and go through the door at the bottom. Hey...
doesn't this look like the Tyrano Lair? Duh...it is! Keep on moving
through it, as it is very easy to find your way around. Soon you'll
reach a screen with three switches, the middle is a save, the left
to open up a pit and the right to drop monsters. You escape by
falling down the pit.

Soon after that, you'll end up at the previous entrance to the Tyrano
Lair. Once you fall down into the cell which held the Laruba civilians
captive, make your way to Kino's cell, save, put on fire protection,
go up, and fight another Tyrano, the Rust Tyrano.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rust Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It will use that stupid countdown attack every now and then, so be
careful. When it's counting, pound it with all you have. When it's
not, just heal and attack. Be careful, the longer the battle goes,
the shorter the countdown gets. And the bigger the damage.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rust Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Crono, Ayla
Just like the Black Tyrano, without Azala. Don't wait for it to drop
its defense, it's already down. Hit it with Triple Kick, Luminaire
and Dark Matter (basically, go for the throat). Charm for Red Mail.
Heh, coulda used that BEFORE you fought him, right?

Go forward to grab the Shell, but it's too damn heavy!!! So exit,
and you'll appear in Guardia Castle. The King's soldiers will collect
it for you. Now put Marle in your party and go to Guardia Castle,
1000 A.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardia Castle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Lapis, Hyper Ether, Elixir, Prism Helms/Prism
                        Dress, Prism Specs, Rainbow

The King's on trial...for selling the Rainbow Shell! Find the
courtroom, and try to get in. You'll fail, so head down to the new
wing of the castle, where the Shell is. You'll need to grab a piece
to show that it's all a hoax set up by the Chancellor. So get to the
Shell, read the note, grab a shard and head back to the courtroom.

They still won't let you in, but Marle will think of a way to get in.
She crashes in through a window, and then the Chancellor will reveal
himself to be Yakra number something. You've gotta fight him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra XIII
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Haste if you have it, if not, just use your most powerful Triple
Techs, and Dual Techs. He'll you some pretty powerful attacks, if
you're hurting, use Frog or Robo to heal and the other two to pound
him.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra the Somethingth
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marle, Ayla, Lucca
Charm it for something good, I forget. Twin Charm it for some dummied
item (rumor?). Well, use Antipode2/3, whichever you've got, and use
Cube Toss (best Ice attack in my opinion).

Watch the scene, and Melchior will come up and ask you to meet him
in the treasury. But, go back in the courtroom, pick up the shiny
thing (Yakra Key), and find the locked chest in one of the rooms
adjacent to the stairway. Unlock it and the real Chancellor will
appear.

Back in the treasury, at the Shell, Melchior will make you either
a Prism Dress or 3 Prism Helms. Dress is the best ladies' armour,
Helms are the best Helms. If you have the Sun Stone, talk to him
again and he'll make you the Prism Specs and Rainbow. Rainbow is the
most powerful sowrd for Crono, Prism Specs ups attack power by
half. Put them on Crono and you've got yourself a war machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquest 8: The Black Omen
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Can Collect: Megaelixir x6, Magic Seal, 30000G, Magic Seal
                        Vigil Hat, Elixir x2, Nova Armor, Haste Helm
                        Zodiac Cape, Power Seal, Speed Tab x4, White
                        Rock

To get in, fly to 12000 BC, 600 AD or 1000 AD, fly under it and get
in. If you destroy it in 12000 BC, it won't appear again, but if you
destroy it in 1000 AD, you can go back to 600 AD and do it all over
again. A very, very nice way to gain some levels.

Ok, I say make your party Ayla, Robo and either Crono or Magus. Crono
would be best for this situation as if you have the Rainbow and Prism
Specs you can do a heap of damage. Robo's the healer and Ayla can
Charm a whole heap of good stuff. The enemies to Charm off are the
bosses, Flyclops, Synchrite, Ruminator and Goon. You'll get Gold
Erng and Stud, Megalixirs and Nova Armors :-)

Before you enter, there will be Laser Guards at the door. A good
dose of Lightning 2 or a Falcon Hit will dispose of them. Inside,
you'll meet Queen Zeal and she'll bring out the Mega Mutant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mega Mutant
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, it's got lots of very damaging attacks. Every now and then it
will pull off an attack which will take you down to 1 HP, so use
techs which hit both halves of the monster.

Keep going north, and to get a save point, kill all of the monsters
there (don't forget to Charm). Then head north, and kill the panels
to continue. Keep on heading north, fight some hard battles and
step into the teleporter.

You'll be heading down an elevator now, and whenever you move you'll
be fighting a battle (well, for me anyway).Get through this next
room while picking up the very important treasures, and soon you'll
be in a room with two Nus and a save. One of them will ask you
something about do you want to wake up, if you choose wake up, you'll
be sent off the ship. The other one sells items.

Continue heading north, and you'll reach a room with a queue of
Ruminators. Kill them to get through, and follow the path around,
south past that Tubster enemy, and in the room with a teleporter,
ignore it and go west for a Speed Tab. Then go in the teleporter.

Head into the next room, north west, east past those enemies, north
and east to reach some chests. To the west of here is a save, save
and go north to face the Giga Mutant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giga Mutant
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Only use magic here, I suggest putting Magus and Crono in your party
for this one. Watch out, the top counters with a MP drain, the bottom
with a Lifeshaver. Just use your most powerful magic (Dark Matter,
Luminaire, Shock, Flare, delta Triple Techs) to get this over with.

Go back and use a Shelter, you'll need to be back to full strength.
Go north into the teleporter, onto the elevator and exit up top.
Continue north until the panels, save and face the Terra Mutant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Terra Mutant
---------------------------------------------------------------------

My strategy was to just hit the top, as the bottom is healed by magic.
Single magic attacks (Dark Bomb) work nice on the top, otherwise
use dual/triple techs which are only aimed at the top. Don't try
touching the bottom half at all.

A chest here contains the White Rock. Go north all the way to reach
a Lavos Spawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Spawn
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's twice as good as the ones on Death Peak. Hit the head only with
your most powerful attacks.

Go north, face the panels, and save. Equip some Blue armor (to your
healer) and get ready for a long fight/s. In the next room or so will
be the Mammon Machine, Queen Zeal will appear and fight you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Queen Zeal
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Having Frog here is quite useful. Pound her to death, and when she
uses Halation, have Frog use Frog Squash and have someone Cure right
after that. Always cure your party, otherwise they'll be wiped out
real quick. When you beat her, she sends you into the Mammon Machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mammon Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hard. If you physically hit it, it's defense wil go up, if you
magically attack it, it's power increases. It's also got two phases,
dormant and active. Use active to kill, dormant to heal. My tip?
Conserve MP, and use physical attacks (Crono, Rainbow, Prism Specs,
whoo-hoo!).

Now your'e on top of the Omen. If Magus is here you can watch a
battle of words go on, and if you do have Magus there his music will
play in the background of the battle (sweet!). Anyway, you'll still
have to fight her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeal
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Whoa. One head, two hands. Charm the Hands for a Prism Dress/Helm.
Killing the head will end the battle. Heal very often and use your
best attacks on the head (Triple Techs, Antipode, Ice/Fire Sword,
Swordstream, etc.) and when you half-kill it, it uses Halation and
then a MP buster. I suggest using a Megaelixir after that, then
pounding it again. Good luck.

After she's gone, she'll mumble something to Lavos, the Black Omen
will be destroyed and you'll be near...Lavos.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Final Battle with Lavos
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, four ways to get here. The first is through the Black Omen,
second the bucket in the End of Time, third the teleporter in Leene
Square and fourth the Epoch. There is also the part in 12000 BC, when
Crono sacrifices himself.

You can fight Lavos at these points in the game to get different
endings:

At the start of the game, through the teleporter
After your first trip back from 600 AD
Just after you get to the End of Time
Before getting the Hero Medal
Between getting the Hero Medal and Masamune
After you get the Masamune, before seeing Frog.
After Frog has the Masamune, before facing Magus for the first time
After beating Magus and before the Tyrano Lair
After Tyrano Lair, before Lavos in the Ocean Palace
After seeing Schala opening the door (don't charge your pendant)
At the end of the game, after the subquests

To hell with that, let's beat him! BTW, if you fight on the Epoch,
you'll lose it in the end. The Epoch, that is.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Shell
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This part only applies to those who came in any other way than via
the teleporter and at the Ocean Palace, I think. First, it assumes
the form of previous bosses. They are Dragon Tank, Guardian,
Heckran, Zombor, Masamune, Nizbel, Magus, Black Tyrano, and Giga Gaia.
After you beat each one, it will give you time to rest. Go up to the
shell to fight again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Tank
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First, aim all attacks at the head (normal attacks). Heal when needed
too. When the head is gone, start attacking the body. This is too
easy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardian
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Just use normal attacks, maybe techs to get it done faster. First,
kill off the two Bits, as if you attack the Guardian first they will
all do a super move on you. Once they are gone (it won't take long),
pummel the Guardian with normal attacks. The Bits will revive, so
take them out again, and repeat once more to kill the Guardian.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heckran
---------------------------------------------------------------------

He's quite easy. Just don't hit him when he challenges you to,
otherwise he'll counterattack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zombor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Fire magic on the lower body, and Ice magic on the upper body.
The person which isn't required for a tech can damage the other part
or heal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Masamune
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty tough. Whenever it says "storing tornado energy", use
Crono's Slash tech to get rid of it. Use one person to heal (Robo
preferably, he's got Cure Beam which cures multiple targets) while
the other two use an attack like Ice Sword or Fire Sword. Robo's Uzzi
Punch once again comes in handy here. It's hard, but it'll be over
soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you'll need to shock Nizbel with Crono's Lightning to
deal any decent damage to him. Then whack him with Ice Sword, Ice
Sword 2 if possible, and use Robo to heal or use Uzzi Punch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is very hard. He keeps on changing barriers, and whatever magic
he casts is the type you have to use against him. Attack him with
Frog (with the Masamune) to change his barrier, and use your most
powerful type of magic on him. When he risks casting a spell,
quickly fire a Triple Tech), and then after he casts it get ready
to cure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Just attack the Tyrano until he says "Removing Defense". He'll
start counting down, whack him with everything you have until he
reaches 0. Heal, and repeat the process again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giga Gaia
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this quite easy. First, he'll deal some damage, so cure. Then
use your most powerful attacks (Luminaire, Shock, etc.) to get rid
of the arms. Dual and Triple techs are great too. Once the arms are
gone, pummel the body. The arms should come back, rinse, lather and
repeat.

After all the bosses, you'll fight the Lavos Mouth, where the
teleporter people end up at. Full scale attacks are required, don't
stop. Keep pounding him with your best spells, and heal if required.

That's one part of him dead. If you came in through the bucket or
Black Omen, a Gate and save are here. The Gate takes you back to the
End of Time. If you want to know which party I used for the battle
ahead, it was Crono, Magus and Robo. Waste all the Speed Tabs on Robo,
Magic Tabs on Magus and Power Tabs on Crono. Now head up forward,
and you'll fight the Lavos Machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It will attack you straight away, heal and get rid of the arms as
fast as you can. The right arm has more HP than the left, use your
most powerful attacks and spells on it. Once they are gone, wait for
the body/head to use Obstacle and then you can attack it. Whack it as
hard as you can, as if you take too long it will use an extremely
damaging attack on you. It shouldn't be too hard though. When it's dead,
it will make a speech and watch the scene. After the scene, get ready
for the final battle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Core
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Very annoying, your'e in some sort of warp. Watch out for Rock of
Ages and Evil Star, heal right after that. Meanwhile, use your best
group attacks while healing (with Robo). Don't be afraid to use your
items up. The Core is on the right, and the others are the bits (left
is the healer, middle is the body). First, concentrate on the two bits,
and when they are gone go for the Core. It will regenerate the bits,
and then go for the Core. Once that's gone, go for the bits and they
may revive the Core. If they do, just keep hitting the Core until
it dies and go for the bits. The healing bit is a bugger, take that
out too. Persist and it will die. Then you'll be swallowed into a
time warp, and the ending will play....

Wvyern's Tactic:

i forgot where i left off, so let me just finish up...i noticed a
glitch in the tips section on some CT websites; when they say,
"Destroy the left bit first", the player automatically assumes their
left, but sometimes they mean the left of the enemy. It's never too
clear, so for future reference, I always mean the character's left or
right.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Magus, Ayla or Marle
This is the easiest boss yet. Lavos will copy previous bosses up to
the Black Tyrano; that means HP, defenses and attacks. Easy. Even
easier if you fly the Epoch to 1900 AD, but i'm sure that's no mystery
to anyone.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Again
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Magus, Ayla or Marle
 Be sure to have your status-protecting gear on, and don't bother
equipping the Charm Top on Ayla, if you've got her. She can't charm
Lavos. Instead, give her PrismSpecs or the Greendream or something.
He's a bit annoying, but not too tough, even for first time players.
He'll open up with mass destruction, so heal up with Ayla (Marle
works better). Return fire with Luminaire and Dark Matter, and Triple
Kick at every opportunity. When the arms die, wait for Lavos to cast
Obstacle (lowers his defense) and lay in on him with your muscle techs.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Core
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever you beat Lavo Again with Lavos Core can be quite difficult.
Whatever happens, do NOT cast a mass destruction spell when you first
get in the battle. He'll counterattack with something nasty like
Crying Heavens, which does somewhere around 1000 damage. Instead,
Triple Kick the left (that's your left) bit. It should die. Wait for
the right bit to lower Lavos' defense, then attack with your Luminaire
and Dark Matter. The core is only the muscle of the team, the right
bit is the brains. Kill the right bit and your worries are over.
It'll revive the others after a time, so be quick about it.

Another possible strategy, if you've killed off Magus...

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Again
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Marle
I picked this combo because of their triple tech, Final Kick. It's
quite a damage dealer. Marle comes in great handy with her curative
magic and Life2 (you should have it) is just what the doctor ordered.
Use Triple Kick and Luminaire until you've done in the arms and he
uses Obstacle, then use Final Kick (It's a good idea to have Ayla or
Crono equip the Gold Stud...I hate stopping to refill MP). Keep
Marle's turns open as much as possible as well...don't do anything
stupid like shoot Lavos with her crossbow. Her spells don't really
cut it in the damage department, so leave her open to play nurse.
That way you can go fight the Core with full strength.

Wvyern's Tactic:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Core
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Marle, Ayla
Not much different...use Triple Kick on the left bit and Luminaire
when it drops its defense. If something should happen to Ayla, a
single crossbow shto and Confuse should do the job, if you have the
Valkerye equipped. When it gets down to the right bit, use Final
Kicks whenever possible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4)Endings
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Depending on the conditions in which you fought Lavos, you can get
one of these endings:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Game Over. Lose to Lavos to get this.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Behind the Scenes. At the start of the game, through the teleporter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Something's wrong with Guardia Castle...After your first trip back
from 600 AD and before going into Guardia Castle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4.The Nu. Just after you get to the End of Time, and before you go to
600 AD again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Tata' Discovery. After Zombor, before getting the Hero Medal
---------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Assorted. Between getting the Hero Medal and Masamune
---------------------------------------------------------------------
7.The Gurus. After you get the Masamune, before you give it to Frog
---------------------------------------------------------------------
8.Frog and Magus. After Frog has the Masamune, before facing Magus for
the first time
---------------------------------------------------------------------
9.The Reptites. After beating Magus and before the Tyrano Lair
---------------------------------------------------------------------
10.The Prophet. After Tyrano Lair, before Lavos in the Ocean Palace
---------------------------------------------------------------------
11.The Girls Chat. After seeing Schala opening the door (don't charge
your pendant)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
12.No Crono. Don't revive Crono.
12a Have the Epoch
12b Don't have the Epoch
---------------------------------------------------------------------
13.Complete Ending. Do all of the subquests and revive Crono.
13a Have the Epoch
13b Don't have the Epoch

You get New Game + this way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
So there are all the endings, I won't spoil them for you. I mean, what
happens in them.

But JJL will spoil them for you right here! Thanks JJL!

The endings

There are 11 possible endings (more if you want to count all the
variations that some of the endings have).  Following is a list
containing the conditions to get each ending, a short desciption of each,
and some of the variations on each (if any).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CONDITION: Beat Lavos at the beginning of the game, before going
to 600 AD for the first time;
       OR
defeat Lavos in 12000 BC when he is supposed to kill Crono.
DESCRIPTION: You end up at the End of Time.  Here you'll find
a bunch of characters from the game.  Talk to each one (they're
actually the development team for Chrono Trigger.  Make sure to
enter all 8 pillars to talk to everyone, plus walk off the Epoch
dock to find a couple other, um...people :)
Once you've talked to everyone talk to the guy who looks like
Gaspar and you'll let you through the door that normally leads
to Spekkio's room.  Enter the door, talk to the five people in
there, then enjoy probably the fastest credit listing ever.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONDITION:  Defeat Lavos after returning from 600 AD the first
time.
DESCRIPTION: You'll end up back at Lucca's telepad invention.
Everyone recognizes Marle as the princess now.  When you reach the
bottom of Leene Square, Marle will suggest returning to the castle.
She asks the king what is the matter with the townspeople.
The kings says the found a 400 year old wedding album.
It ends showing a film of Frog and Queen Leene at the Cathedral,
and Marle screaming.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.CONDITION:  Defeat Lavos after get Robo and going to the End of Time
for the first time.
DESCIPTION: A Nu and a frog-like creature run around while the credits
are displayed.  Ends with the above two creatures and a Spekkio-like
creature falling asleep.
VARIATIONS: not likely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4.CONDITION:  Defeat Lavos after returning from 65000000 BC the first
time.
DESCRIPTION: Shows the credits along with pictures of characters
from the game.
VARIATIONS: again, not likely

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5.CONDITION:  Beat Lavos after defeating Masa & Mune, but before
getting the Hero Medal and going to see Frog.
DESCRIPTION: Starts with Robo appearing in 2300 AD.  But since
Lavos was destroyed, the Day of Lavos never happened.  Therefore
2300 AD is not in ruins.  Robo is in Truce (probably Truce Dome)
right near Leene's Bell.  Atropos comes out and bumps into Robo.
Then it shows Robo and Atropos sitting on a cliff looking out
into a valley.
It then switches to 600 AD where Tata the Hero is leaving the Guardia
Castle throne room.  He goes to Magus's Castle and when he reaches
him, it turns out to be, not Magus, but Crono, Marle, and Lucca.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6.CONDITION:  Kill Lavos after getting Frog for the second time (after
getting the Masamune fixed.
DESCRIPTION:  Starts with all the characters in Lucca's house.  Frog
exits the house and goes to Magus's Lair, defeats his 3 henchmen,
and then reaches Magus.  Then shows Frog lunging at Magus with
his sword drawn.  After that it shows the credits.  Ends with
a picture of a cloaked figure standing on top of the dragon
statue that sits on Magus's castle. (Note from Magus:Who is it? I'm
hoping it's Magus. I mean, Frog's good and all, but surely I can't
die!!! Nooo...)
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
7.CONDITION:  Defeat Lavos after defeating Magus in 600 AD.
DESCRIPTION:  The beginning of the game is replayed with the
credits rolling.  The difference is Crono, his mom, and everyone
else are Reptites :)   It seems without your help Ayla was unable
to defeat Azala, so the Reptites were able to take over and
rule the earth.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
8.CONDITION:  Defeat Azala in 65000000 BC, then defeat Lavos.
DESCRIPTION: While the credits are shown, scenes of different
locales in the game are shown, all with one or more of the
main characters doing something.  Ends with Magus (as the Prophet)
in the Ocean Palace saying he's coming for Lavos.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
9.CONDITION:  Defeat Lavos with Crono dead.
DESCRIPTION: Wake up at the End of Time.  The pillars of light are
about to close forever.  Aylas splits for her own time, as does
Robo and Frog.  Finally, Marle and Lucca go back to the present.
Back in 1000 AD, Marle is in the Moonlight Parade.  After the
parade go to the top section of Leene Square.  From this point
the ending changes depending on a few other conditions (see
variations).
VARIATIONS:
a) If the Epoch is destroyed (ie you flew it into Lavos), you'll
find all the characters waiting for you in the top section of
Leene Square.  Try to talk to each of them and they'll run up
to where Lucca's invention is.  A bunch of stuff will happen
resulting in everyone but Marle entering a time gate.  Take
Marle down to where you'll find the king.  Marle will end up
carried away by balloons.  After the credits it'll show Marle
running off toward Crono's shadow.

a1) The above will change slightly if you have the C. Trigger
before killing Lavos.

a2) If Magus is alive (ie you had him join your party instead of
killing him) the above will change a little.

b) If the Epoch is not destroyed, you'll only find Lucca waiting for
you in the top section of Leene Square.  Follow her up to Lucca's
invention.  Lucca says they should dismantle the Epoch, then
a Gate opens and Robo, Ayla, Gaspar, and some guy with long
green hair comes though.  Gaspar leaves though the gate, then
Robo and Ayla jump in.  The green haired guy starts going towards
the Gate and Marle stop him and asks what's going on.  The
green haired guy says the 'time egg' can bring Crono back.
Marle asks the guy who he is and then he jumps into the Gate and
it closes.  "Could it have been Frog?" Marle and Lucca wonder.
They then decide to go after them in the Epoch.
The bit with the king and the bell presentation takes place,
then Marle and Lucca take off in the Epoch.  Ends with Marle
running towards Crono's shadow like above.

b1) Changes slightly if Magus is alive.  Frog is still in the
form of a frog so the bit with Marle and Lucca wondering who
he is doesn't happen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
10.CONDITION:  Lose in the fight against Lavos
DESCRIPTION: Witness the destruction that takes place in 1999 AD on
the 'Day of Lavos'.
VARIATIONS: none that I know of

---------------------------------------------------------------------
11.CONDITION:  Beat Lavos with all the subquests solved and the Black
Omen destoyed.
DESCRIPTION: Crono's stay of execution is cancelled.  Marle says he
hasn't done anything and the king drops all charages.  Marle's
ancestors and descendants all come out (thanks to Lucca) and
they say how great Crono and company are.  The Moonlite Parade
takes place then you are free to travel around the fair grounds.
Go up to where Lucca's invention is and your team will go back
to their own times.  What happens next depends on other conditions
(see variations).
If you get this ending you will have the NEW GAME + option
when you reset the game.
VARIATIONS:
a) If you saved Lara (Lucca's mom) she will be standing instead
of sitting.

b) If you didn't let Magus join your party he won't go back to
his own time (obviously).

c) If the Epoch has not been destroyed Crono's mom will chase
Crono's cats into the gate and then it closes.  You're then
told to find the king.  He reveals Nadia's bell, then Crono,
Marle, and Lucca enter the Epoch to look for Crono's mom.
(The more cats you have the more Crono's mom will chase into
the gate).

c1)If the Epoch is destroyed it ends with Crono helping Marle
place Nadia's bell and Crono & Marle flying away with
some balloons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
5)Beat Spekkio!
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Like many other people I know, at first I had trouble beating Spekkio.
So here's a guide on how to beat him and what you'll get after you do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono on Level 1-19
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spekkio will have 800HP, and will appear as a white Kiwala. Honestly,
this is quite easy. Put Marle and Lucca in your party, and fire up
the elemental spells, and including the Triple Tech. You get 1 Magic
Tab and 5 Ethers for winning.

From RPGenius-
At Level 11 Spekkio is actually a frog. Magus:Okay, I made a mistake
then.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono on Level 20-29
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spekkio will have 2200 HP, and will appear as a blue Goblin. Just
use the same tactic from above, maybe use Ayla. You'll get 1 Magic
Tab and five Mid-Ethers for winning.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono on Level 30-39
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spekkio will have 4800 HP, and will appear as a red Omnicrone. I
suggest using Crono, Frog and Robo. Robo can heal while Frog and
Crono can do some serious damage via Swordstream and Spire. Triple
Raid is good too, you'll get 1 Magic Tab and 5 Full Ethers for your
efforts.

From Cosmo2-
On Spekio Level 30-39, you mentioned that Triple Raid might help,
however, all physical attacks always miss on Spekkio. Magus: I'm
pretty sure that didn't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono on Level 40-98
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spekkio will have 10000 HP, and will appear as Masa & Mune. It's
hard, now that you have Magus, wait until you get his Dark Matter
spell. Combine that with Crono and Frog and you are unstoppable.
You'll get 1 Magic Tab, 1 Speed Tab, 1 Power Tab and 10 Elixirs for
your efforts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono on Level **
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spekkio will have 20000 HP, and will appear as a pink Nu. This is
hard. But stick to the Crono, Magus/Robo, Frog formula and you will
be fine. For your efforts you'll get a whopping ten of each: Magic
Tabs, Power Tabs, Speed Tabs and Megaelixirs!!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

9)Upgrading? What? and what's this New Game +?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading is the art of waiting patiently to get better items. I'm
talking about the sealed chests. When you go up to them in 600 A.D,
examine it and choose not to take the object out. Then, go to 1000
A.D, pick up the "upgraded" item, then return to 600 A.D and recieve
the normal item.

And the New Game +. Well, to get it, you've got to complete everything
the walkthrough says, you can't skip a subquest, kill Magus, or not
revive Crono. After you're done, reset the console, and you'll get a
New Game + option that allows you to start a New Game, while retaining
the level and items, weapons, armor etc. of an already saved save
slot. Cool, huh?

---------------------------------------------------------------------
10)FAQs
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How long will this take to finish?

A. Improper, low levels, and no sub-quests will probably be 20 hours
plus. Follow the guide, good high levels and all sub-quests? 40 hours
plus, but it's worth it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. When i walk into the Trann Dome in Chrono, all I can see is smoke.
Is that how it is supposed to be? It's a ROM. Would that have anything
to do with that, or is that how it looks in the SNES cart? Please
help!!!

A. No, use the 1-5 buttons on the keyboard to change the graphics
settings, it's like that. But when you take the fog off, you can't see
the text. Bummer.

From Xerain:
Rather than turning off the offeneding background using ZSNES, it is
better to change the video mode. Go under config and select video. Put
it to one of the 16B settings.
Use the 640x480x16B VESA2 setting, and if it runs slow, use the
320x240x16B VESA2 for similar effects, but lower resolution.
These are general ZSNES tips for all Roms. I am aware you may know
them (If you even use the rom, that is), but your readers may not. If
I come up with any more tips I'll be sure to let you know.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. When I'm in the Arris Dome, entering the password, I enter it but
can't seem to go anywhere, help?

A. A door opens on the top right-hand corner, and a platform should
drop. Hold L,R and then press A, that might work. I've had many
questions about this, it's usually just the way you're pressing the
buttons.

From Alan Berck:
Hi! I'm here just to say that you have very nice FAQ. I would like to
point out that on some emulators, the keyboard will read the L + R
then A password as the L and R repeting.To make it work, get a
joystick, joypad, any other controller with 2 buttons. then plug it
in, and set L to one button and R to another. then press all 3 in the
correct order.

From Mitchell Mebane:
I read your Chrono Trigger FAQ, it is one of the best, and I've got a
few tips for you.

You stated that many people have said that they can't push the L+R+A
sequence, at the Arris Dome in 2300 A.D. Well, the problem isn't your
ROM, it isn't your emulator (this only occurs on emulators,) it's your
KEYBOARD. I had a heck of a time with this, until I read the ZSNES
help file (ZSNES.FAQ). The problem lies in the way the PC keyboard
sends its data to the computer. You can only press a certain number of
buttons at a time, or the keyboard cancels out the others. A couple
ways around this are: assign the L, R, and A buttons to one key, such
as Page Up. Then, pressing that key enters the code. Another way is to
assign them to the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys. Since the PC keyboard
accepts any combinations of the modifier keys, this works also. The
final way, my personal favorite, is to simply use a joystick. I've got
a Microsoft SideWinder gamepad, and it is SWEEEET! Its buttons are
almost exactly the same as the SNES gamepad. Also, you can connect up
to four SideWinder pads together, this, in combination with the
keyboard, lets you use all the players in a MultiTap game. A Gravis
eXterminator gamepad would work well, too. (I'm not sure if you can
chain them, though.)
Another way to fix this is to emulate on a Mac. The Mac keyboards
don't have this problem (at least the iMac keyboards don't.)

DC: Which means...assign L,R and A all to one key on the keyboard,
and press that to activate the door! It's so simple! (Lucky I've got a
good keyboard :-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I've noticed that sometimes in battle the screen will flash when I
make an attack, and the damage I do will be much more.  How do I do
this; is it random or am I doing something to make it happen?

A. It's called a critical hit. This is random, although there are some
items which up your critical hit rating (see the list).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Is there a certain level you need to be on to defeat a boss?

A. No, not really, but from the last boss you fought till the next
one, you should at least gain 3 or 4 levels, if not 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. If you have the Chrono Trigger (CT) instruction booklet, you'll
notice that under The Weapons List there is somthing called the
Fleaver. Being one of the best CT players I know, I have come to think
that it is for Crono, IF by any chance it's real. I've found
everything in the game, so I'm really anxious to find something new,
and also to see what color it is (cuz' I only keep the coolest looking
swords/weapons!)

A. I'm pretty sure (from other sources) that the Fleaver was changed
at the last moment to the Slasher. Any know the real story? Or am I
right?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Hello. I've recently downloaded Chrono Trigger for my ZSNES player
and it's working great, except that after I press the Y button to go
to the Character Swap screen, it freezes when I try to quit the menu.
Do you have any tips for me to get around this? When Ayla joins the
team, you are forced to get her on your team via this screen, so I
can't further my game until I can figure out a way around this
problem. Thank you for your time. (This problem encountered by two
people)

A.Okay, first sorry for the late response. These two mails got lost in
the mountains of mail I recieve a day. Now this seems to be a really
common problem! The only thing I can think of that is wrong is that
the site where you got this from has a dodgy ROM. If you could both
tell me the site from which you acquired the ROM, and if they
are the same, that's probably your problem.

From Tabitha Jensen-
You've got to play with sounds on (find the option in your emulator).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.This may seem like a dumb question, but is there any way to save
Schala? I've noticed that if you have Magus, one of the ending
variations is of him searching for her.  I thought maybe because of
the subquest where you're supposed to save someone close to you that
your supposed to save her.

A.I'd love to save her, but unfortunately you can't. Sorry! The quest
you're referring to is the Queen Zeal quest, by the way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. just wondering some thing , i use to always go with Crono Alya and
marle..but is Frog good enough to replace alya? i mean i would have to
start giving him some magic tabs but my frog is at lvl28 while alya
is at lvl 29 and im at the Zeal Place...

A. Sure! Just build up those levels!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Also i dont get it ....useing the stones like the black or gold
stone to pull off a triple tech...but crono isnt in it and i forgot...
couldnt you not get rid of crono outta your party?

A. Well, Crono is unavailable for a while at the end...The rocks
enable you to peform triple techs without him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.b4 you enter the right door in the way back where you see the Nu
and a guy trying to make "tabs" i forgot how you make the Nu talk to
you or give you some magic tabs.........but what really werid is
before you enter the room to the right there are two book Caes and the
2nd one above that theres something Sparkling..wondering if i could
get it?

A.
From JDemon14:
hey i just wanna say that your FAQ is great.  i was looking at the
questions and 1 of the questions was about a shining object on top of
the double bookcases and you said you doubt it can be reached but it
can.  to get it you have to go in the room with the people making the
tabs and check the wall on the bottom right and you'll get the
object. the object is a tab but i don't remember which 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.where can i get  a doom sickle for magus?

A.In Ozzie's Fort. It's right here-
After that, you'll be in a room with Ozzie and a treasure chest.
Ignore it, and head to the exit. An Imp will try to take it but die.
Ozzie will run. Grab the chest, and before exiting, go to the very
right wall and go down to reach a secret room with Magus' best
equipment. Now go out and face Ozzie, Flea and Slash.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Do you know what Level ** for chrono is or means. I used the game
genie code because i was curious.  Does it mean that he stays the same
level because he never gains levels, hp, or mp.  i heard it means that
he's on level 99 but why doesn't he hav enough hp and mp. i don't get
it. can u help me out?

A.I think it does mean level 99. as for the hp/mp thing, I think it's
because of the codes, that you can't make them higher.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Arg, with the subquest where you revive Crono, the first part,  the
first doll thing that helps you when it turns into a tree.  Ok, well
the problem is I get behind it, but the wind still blows me away.
I've even leaned against the tree.  Is there any reason for this?

A.Push up against the tree. Keep moving up against it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Hello. I just got back Chrono on CT but i have a question... In your
FAQ it said that to have Magus in your party u have to NOt fight him
when youu meet him at that one plac in 12000 BC.  Before reading your
FAQ i didnt know better and i fought him anyway.  Is there a way i can
get Magus on my team besides doing a plus game?

A.Sorry, but I think you're stuffed. I believe there's no way to get
him back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.ok ok ok .. i know chrono trigger is a very old game but i still
think it rocks!!!

so anyway ... during "the fated hour" if you talk to the old man at
the end of time he'll tell you of different quests and stuff you can
do to get more exp and shittos like that ... but there's one i did not
find on your walkthrough at GameFAQs ... what is the solution to the
subquest where the old man says "one of you is close to someone in
danger, find this person FAST"

A.That's the Black Omen/Zeal Palace/Queen Zeal quest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Q.Hello, DC
I was seaching through Gamefaqs, and i found your document. I've got
a question to ask you aobut chrono trigger: Currently in my game, all
my characters are unable to learn future TECHS, such as Magus can learn
only up to Dark bomb, cuz the next tech requires 60000+ tech points,
which will take forever. So everyone's tech has stopped tracks, which
means i have not seen any of those dual or triple techs. But anywayz,
do you have a clue why its like this?

A.Yes. It's called a challenge. Don't stop building up those tech
points, it is possible!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Q.Hi Magus.  First off, thanx for this awesome walkthrough of Chrono
Trigger, it's seriously helped me.  Right now, I'm on Zeal, and that
MP buster is seriously hurting me.  I don't know how to equip items
like Mega Elixer to save my MP.  How do you eqip items?!?

A.Equip items? No, when it's your turn to make a move, instead of
hitting attack or tech, select Item, and then you'll have a full list
of your items. Select the item you wish to use, and voila.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Hey Magus, what's up?  I have a question about Chrono Trigger.
I can't find the Crono clone!  I'm using your guide to the game.
The only thing I might have screwed up on is that I got the clone
after I lost Crono, not before,in the very begining of the game.  I've
searched all over the game world, but to no avail.  Help me out here!

A.
From Blank Sinatra:
-You can go back and play the house of horrors game, and aquire the
clone after chrono goes to the big Gate in the sky.  Just build up
those silver points and practice your mimicing skills.  After you win
the clone itll be sitting in chrono's bedroom.

From Urs:
-It appears to me that the clones availability depends on which part
of the game you are in. I got it after some serious action, after I
defeated Magus for the first time in 600BC. It is now in my room and
ready and waiting to help me revive Crono (or so I think as he just
vanished 5 minutes ago.) At an earlier point of the game I went back
to the present and completed the 2nd house of horrors game without
getting the clone, so I tried again later and-Bingo-there it was.

From MoleHybrid:
-I'd just like to say, you CAN get the Chrono clone after the
beginning of the game. When Belthasar's clone (the Nu) tells you about
it,you can win it afterward.Go into the tent of horrors, and give the
guy the silver points. You just have to pay money if you mess up this
time, more if you mess up earlier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Q.Hey i Jus was Lookin throuGH my old rpgs and i Picked Up CHroNo
trIggER. i started playin it again and i got to magus at the north
cape(second battle.) Well i have always gotton him before when beating
the game but this time i decided to fight him. well i killed him and i
was wondering when the FroG(glenn) would turn back into a human. i
have looked through all the walkthroughs and none of them say n e
thing about when the frog turns bak to glenn if u fight magus. pLeasE
write bak thank your so much.

A.I think he turns back into a human in the ending.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Q.I have Chrono Trigger on my Computer and I'm using Snemul.  I read
your Faq and thought you might be able to help me.  Whenever I get in
a battle, Magus attacks one of his own team members or he attacks
without me telling him to.  He has that funny star on his head too and
he won't stop until I heal him or he gets attacked.  What is the
problem and how can I solve it?

A.This means he's in Chaos mode. You're probably wearing the Ozzie
Pants, if you're not, then you've been hit with a status change by the
enemy. The item Heal will fix this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.I have a question for your Chrono Trigger FAQ:
Where is Marle's best weapon, The Valkerye?

A.Northern Ruins (A Ghost Called Cyrus quest). It needs to be
upgraded however.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.How do you open up the black boxes?

A.You need to charge up the pendant in 12000BC first.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.After defeating Son of Sun, I can't seem to get the Stone in the
door!!!

A.There's no door...it's on a platform.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
11)Tips
---------------------------------------------------------------------

------------
Golem Twins?
------------

From Benjamin Han:

There is actually a easier way to beat twin Golem. First you cast
boogie. Then cast twister two times. then use boogie again then repeat
step two. Keep on doing this until you kill it. (twister does over
2,000 points of damage).


From Matthew Pace:

I'm sorry but this Benjamin Han person is stupid (Magus:a bit harsh?).
The easiest way to kill the Golem Twins is for Chrono to use Luminaire
and Lucca and Frog to use Frog Flare. This takes a lot of magic but you
can get it back before any more real major battles.

---------------------
Lucca and Marle rule!
---------------------

From Cosmo2-

Sorry to send you another mail, but I thought you might like to tell
players the following about Lucca and Marle.  Lucca's attack magic is
second only to Magus's.  I recently started over complete, New Game-
not+.
Lucca, who is now Lv24, has about 35mag, while everyone else only has
from 15 to 20 (except Marle, who has 27).  This makes up for the fact
that her shots are weak until very late in the game, about when you
lose Chrono, and her Wonder Shot can do some kick&%$#@ damage. Mine
once did 4000+ with one hit, but since the damage is random, it
sometimes does a measly 25-50.

Also, even though Marle's HP and physical stats are low in the first
50 or so Lvls, she's still worthhaving along for your high MP and her
array of curative magics.

---------------
Blackbird Hints
---------------

From Cosmo2-

I have a suggestion for Blackbird.  With Ayla and two others, as you
said, take all the good EQ off your party members, so that all your
good Eq is in your Items list.  The items chest is one of the easiest
to find, and once you do find it, you have the best armor and weapons
for all three people.  The thing is, once you find the actual chests
containing the weaker armor you had earlier, you have to re-equip the
good armor.

------------------
Lavos Spawn = Good
------------------

From MettleGoblet:

If you manage to kill the lavos spawn shell on death mountain it gives
MEGA experience because it has 20,000 hp and it may also give you a
prism edge

--------------
Sparkling Tabs
--------------

From Lone Jester:
-I have something else I have to add to your strategy
guide on Chrono Trigger.  In your FAQ, there was a
question about the Nu and the sparkling tabs in Zeal.
There is a way to reach that sparkling tab.  From
where you see the tab,, simply walk in the room and
search the wall, and be happy when you find a brand
new magic tab.  As for the Nu that is in the same
room, just go to Zeal Palace and talk to the Nu on the
walkway in the middle of the room.  He will ask you to
scratch his back.  When you are done, that music that
plays when you find a tab will sound and the screen
will say "Found the Nu's scratch point" or something
like that.  Now head back to the Nu in the library and
talk to him.  You will scratch his back and he will
eventually turn up a magic tab. See you around.

------------------
Lucca Rules, Again
------------------

From Lone Jester :

-You ever notice in Chrono Trigger that when
Lucca gets the Wondershot, her damage she deals to
enemies varies a lot (sometimes over 3,000 and other
times under 100)?  Well, instead of giving Chrono the
Prism Specs, give them to Lucca and the Wondershot
will live up to it's name by dealing over 5,000 damage
to enemies, all depending on what her level is and how
many tabs she has been getting (for me, I was at level
86 and the power stat was maxed out.)

-------------------
Programmer's Ending
-------------------

From Lord999:

Contrary to popular belief, there are TWO ways to get programmer's
ending.

-1.  The way you described, by beating up Lavos right at Mellinial
Fair.

2.  There is one other way, and it's for the suicidal.  The first time
you face Zeal in the Underground Palace, she summons Lavos.  (It's the
part where Chrono gets killed).  This fight is near impossible without
the best armor, but you can beat Lavos in this  form.  I believe he
has 65,665 hit points. This is near impossible, but I've been able
to do it.  I'll send you a Zsnes snapshot if you want to prove my point.
Oh, and I do own the real game, both PSX and SNES.  The same trick
works on PSX.

-----------
Bossy Hints
-----------

From Owen Yates:
I have had extensive experience playing Chrono Trigger, considering I
bought it just after it came out.
(That's a big achievement down here in Australia, I had to pay $130
(@ $104 US) for it, and I have
never regretted it. Anyway, as I consider myself to be somewhat of an
expert on the game, I thought that I would offer some alternative boss
strategies.

Dragon Tank: I usually attack it with Crono's Cyclone attack, and get
Lucca to shoot it in the head

Black Tyrano: I usually use Crono, Ayla & Robo in this battle. I keep
attacking Azala, and get Crono to cast Lightning 2. When the Black
Tyrano gets to the countdown thingy. I usually use Crono & Ayla's
double tech Volt Bite which does around a 1000 damage. As well as
Robo's Robo Tackle which does around 500.

Golem Twins: I usually use Crono, Ayla & Robo for this fight (my
favourite team :) ). I get Ayla & Robo to cast the Double Tech boogie,
which freezes both of the Golems (not always first time). Then I use
Ayla & Crono's Falcon Hit attack, to hit both of them for around 1500
damage.

-------
Wubble?
-------

From Patrick:
I notice that you state that the Rubble's in the Mt of Woe can only be
fought once.  Not so!  If you fight a Rubble and head to a save point on
that  SAME level then you will be able to fight the rubble over and over
if you reset after you save.  Apparently the game brings back all
monsters as long as you do not change levels.

---------------
Getting Bossier
---------------

From Wvyern437:

**************************BOSS LIST**********************************

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Lucca
Have Crono/Frog use X-strike and Lucca use Flame Toss.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Tank
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca
Use regular attacks on the head until it dies, then use Cyclone or
Fire Whirl.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robot Dude
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle
Kill the bits with normal attacks, then concentrate on the body.
Fire/Lightning do 0 damage. Hitting the body while the bits are still
alive results in a delta counter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo's Pals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca/Marle (Lucca works better)
Use Fire Whirl on the center of each line. Two per line should wrap
it up.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heckran
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle
Use Lightning and Antipode. When he says, "Go ahead and attack," wait
for a counterattack break or you'll get a waterwave down your throat.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zombor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Marle (the robot sucks!)
Use Lightning on the bottom (?) and physical attacks on the top. Heal
up, this guy's a pain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Masa and Mune
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Robo (sigh)
Use Hypno Wave to put them out, then concentrate on one. They can't
operate apart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
MasaMune
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Lucca, Robo
Use Dual Techs like Fire Punch and Fire Sword (if you've got it) and
Slash when he stores his Tornado energy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Whoever
Stun him w/Lightning and kill him, it's not rocket science.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Slash
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Robo
Triple Raid and you'll be rewarded with his nifty sword.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flea
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Robo
Be careful! This chick/dude uses status-effecting magic. Store up on
the Heals and Triple Raid or X-strike whenever possible. She doesn't
have much HP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Marle
This is by far the hardest boss yet. Hit him repeatedly with the
Masamune, and wait for his barrier to switch to Water. Then, use Ice
Water, Ice Sword, and Swordstream to bring his HP down. When he starts
casting a spell, hit him with physical attacks until he casts Dark
Matter, then heal up and do it again. He'll die eventually, i promise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nizbel 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Frog
Use physical/lightning techs like Spire and Volt Bite. Charm for a
3rd Eye.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Azala&Black Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Frog
Arm Fire armor, if available. Use magic on Azala till she dies, then
wait for the Black Tyrano to lower its defense. Attack it with your
most powerful techs, and brace yourself for the flame attack it uses
when the counter hits 0. It also bites you to steal HP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever
Good luck, you'll need it. You don't have to kill it, but it really
helps in the EXP. department. It copies attacks, physical being the
worst, so don't hit it. Change up elemental magic attacks as quickly
as possible, because you have a short gap between when it copies and
when it attacks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir Krawlie
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your best.
Hit him hard, he's really easy. Watch out for his attack, though. It
lowers you to 1HP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, Ayla
He's easy, just smack him with powerful techs. He counterattacks
with Iron Orb.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GolemTwins
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Frog, your most magic-resistant character.
Arm Crono and Frog with White Mail/Vest and open up with Lightning2,
then concentrate on each Golem with Spire to chew away the HP. The
third person, unless it's Ayla, should simply sit there and heal
themselves so they can gain EXP. If it's Ayla, you can use Volt Bite.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't matter.
You're gonna die.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GolemBoss
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever's on the Blackbird.
Hit him as hard and as fast as you can, because he never attacks and
eventually gets away. He's worth a nice chunk of EXP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dalton Plus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Blackbird folks.
He uses opposite magic attacks on you, and a Slash-like attack, along
with Iron Orb. Not too tough.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog alone, or three others.
This is an optional battle, and I suggest you don't fight it if it's
your first time through the game. Magus will join you if you spare him,
and his Dark Matter attack is oh so sweet. But if you do choose to
battle him, use Frog, and forget the Masamune. Use a Bravesword if
you've got one. Wear magic-absorbing armor (doesn't matter what, he
uses everything equally it seems) and equip the Frenzy Band. It works
beautifully.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Spawn
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Ayla, Marle
Charm it's head for an Elixir and use Cat Attack and regular attacks
on the head. Hitting the shell will result in a nasty needlespin
counterattack.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Retinite
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Frog, Crono
Kill the core with Confuse and use Ice/Water to destroy the leg/body
defense. Then use Confuse and alternate from Magus to Frog weakening
its defense. Cast spells between every Confuse and it'll drop like a
fly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AtroposXR
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo
I hate Robo and I never use him, and I pay for it now because he
knows Heal Beam. Here's how you beat Atropos with this crappy robot.
Arm the Black Mail to absorb her Laser Spin attacks, your best Hand
and Safe Helm if you've got it, and a Frenzy Band. Works perfectly;
you might have to heal up with the beam thingy if you don't have the
Safe Helm. You're rewarded with her ribbon, which ups his Speed by 3
and Mg. Defense+10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mother Brain and Display
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robo, Magus, Ayla
Charm the Mother Brain for Blue Mail and use a 2nd level element
spell to knock out the Displays, then kill the Mother Brain with
your best techs. You'll get the Terra Arm (Robo's best weapon) and
the Crisis Arm (which sucks but is said to do 9999 damage on a
critical hit; never seen it myself).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Son of Sun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Crono, Frog
Arm Red Mail/Vest/Armor, you'll need it. Use Black Hole to off some
of the flames. It's a guessing game, pick the right flame with a
normal attack and it'll hurt him. Pick the wrong one and he'll
counterattack. Hit him and he'll counterattack with Flare, the most
powerful Fire type spell in the game. So don't do that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rust Tyrano
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magus, Crono, Ayla
Just like the Black Tyrano, without Azala. Don't wait for it to drop
its defense, it's already down. Hit it with Triple Kick, Luminaire
and Dark Matter (basically, go for the throat). Charm for Red Mail.
Heh, coulda used that BEFORE you fought him, right?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yakra the Somethingth
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marle, Ayla, Lucca
Charm it for something good, I forget. Twin Charm it for some dummied
item (rumor?). Well, use Antipode2/3, whichever you've got, and use
Cube Toss (best Ice attack in my opinion).

i forgot where i left off, so let me just finish up...i noticed a
glitch in the tips section on some CT websites; when they say,
"Destroy the left bit first", the player automatically assumes their
left, but sometimes they mean the left of the enemy. It's never too
clear, so for future reference, I always mean the character's left or
right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Magus, Ayla or Marle
This is the easiest boss yet. Lavos will copy previous bosses up to
the Black Tyrano; that means HP, defenses and attacks. Easy. Even
easier if you fly the Epoch to 1900 AD, but i'm sure that's no mystery
to anyone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Again
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Magus, Ayla or Marle
 Be sure to have your status-protecting gear on, and don't bother
equipping the Charm Top on Ayla, if you've got her. She can't charm
Lavos. Instead, give her PrismSpecs or the Greendream or something.
He's a bit annoying, but not too tough, even for first time players.
He'll open up with mass destruction, so heal up with Ayla (Marle
works better). Return fire with Luminaire and Dark Matter, and Triple
Kick at every opportunity. When the arms die, wait for Lavos to cast
Obstacle (lowers his defense) and lay in on him with your muscle techs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Core
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever you beat Lavo Again with Lavos Core can be quite difficult.
Whatever happens, do NOT cast a mass destruction spell when you first
get in the battle. He'll counterattack with something nasty like
Crying Heavens, which does somewhere around 1000 damage. Instead,
Triple Kick the left (that's your left) bit. It should die. Wait for
the right bit to lower Lavos' defense, then attack with your Luminaire
and Dark Matter. The core is only the muscle of the team, the right
bit is the brains. Kill the right bit and your worries are over.
It'll revive the others after a time, so be quick about it.

Another possible strategy, if you've killed off Magus...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Again
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Ayla, Marle
I picked this combo because of their triple tech, Final Kick. It's
quite a damage dealer. Marle comes in great handy with her curative
magic and Life2 (you should have it) is just what the doctor ordered.
Use Triple Kick and Luminaire until you've done in the arms and he
uses Obstacle, then use Final Kick (It's a good idea to have Ayla or
Crono equip the Gold Stud...I hate stopping to refill MP). Keep
Marle's turns open as much as possible as well...don't do anything
stupid like shoot Lavos with her crossbow. Her spells don't really
cut it in the damage department, so leave her open to play nurse.
That way you can go fight the Core with full strength.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavos Core
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crono, Marle, Ayla
Not much different...use Triple Kick on the left bit and Luminaire
when it drops its defense. If something should happen to Ayla, a
single crossbow shto and Confuse should do the job, if you have the
Valkerye equipped. When it gets down to the right bit, use Final
Kicks whenever possible.

Golems Are Stoopid
------------------


From RedScarlet-

Hi there.  I was looking at my faqs on Chrono Trigger and saw you
updated yours as well.  I read through those tips, and didn't see a
little strategy I use, so I guess I'll tell ya if you want to add it.
   One really easy way to get past those 2 annoying Golemtwins is to
have Lucca in your party.  Use her, Crono, and Frog (preferably), and
make sure to equip any fire protection armor you have.  Going through
the game the first time, you should have 1 Red Plate (absorbs 100% of
fire damage)and 1 Red Vest (absorbs 50% of fire damage), if you did
the 'Black Box upgrading' trick.  Equip those if you have them, and
then equip the remaining character with either a Ruby Vest or Ruby
Armor (traded in Ioka for Petals/Fangs/Horns/Feathers).
    Now, your characters have extremely high protection against Fire,
so have Lucca do her best Fire attacks over and over, Fire 2 or Flare,
if you have it, work well.  If you don't have Flare, have Lucca and
Frog do their Double Tech 'Line Bomb', which will hit both Golemtwins
at the same time.
The Golemtwins will always mimic the last elemental attack done to
them, which would be fire, and you should have either 50%,80%,150%,
or 200% protection against it, which should make them die without
having to heal even once.

---------------------------------
The TRUE power of the Frenzy Band
---------------------------------

From Khinath

First off, let me congratulate you on your mad writing skillz used
when writing your Chrono Trigger FAQ for www.gamefaqs.com. It was a
pleasure to read something that wasn't dry or un-humorous like some of
the FAQ's I've seen. I would like to point out something of a flaw
or mix-up, or bad taste in accessories, or something...) made by dear
ol' Lord999 in the following passage...


2. Frenzy band. You find it in the Forest Maze in 65 BC. You can
steal off those jerks in Black Omen too. It's worthless. All it does
is make you beserk forever. Get the Third Eye instead.

Methinks either:

1) He got Frenzy Band confused with Berserker, or...
2) He doesn't realize the TRUE power of the Frenzy Band.

What the Frenzy Band does is, like in the item description, gives one
character an 80% chance of counter-attacking an enemy hit. While
Berserker makes one attack the moment their combat guage is filled,
Frenzy Band is a much better alternative. You know how some
bosses/enemies use counter-attacks when you attack them, right? Wish I
could think of a better example, but the best I could think of is the
Lavos Spawn. If you hit the Spawn's shell, it does a nast needle
attack thing that hurts like HELL...but it can then attack again
almost immediately. It seems unfair that he gets a free hit like that,
and can attack immediately afterwards. That's exactly what the Frenzy
Band does. Let's say you sacrifice wearing the Prism Specs on Chrono
to equip the Frenzy Band, then head to the Black Omen to take on some
of those blasted flying things I hate (I can't remember if they're
Goons or Flyclops, but they look like giant dogs with wings that
appear rather early in the level). Anyhoo...let's say one of the
things decides to whack at Crono when Crono's battle guage is say...
alf full. Crono automatically hits the thing right back (Think about
it: Rainbow sword=70% chance for critical hit) doing a good piece of
damage (especially if he gets a critical hit)...PLUS his attack guage
is still half full, meaning he can attack again in a matter of a
couple of seconds. As an added bonus, any time you counter-attack an
enemy  attack, you are not susceptible to being counter-attacked
yourself by an  enemy counter-attack. *Reads last sentence* Alright...
his calls for an example...(and now that I think about it...probably
the best way to kill the shell of the Lavos Spawn). Please keep in
mind the following scene  is PURELY HYPOTHETICAL. I haven't tested it,
but if it works, it'd be kick-ass. If someone wants to test it, then
by all means go for it!

Lets go back to the Lavos Spawn. You equip everyone with Frenzy Bands.
If you have enough HP and a high enough defense rating, have some brave
soul whack that shell! When it does its multiple person counter attack,
everyone gets a free counter-whack at the shell...without being
counter-attacked! Now, you've just hit the Spawn four times, using one
character's turn! Have someone in your party heal everyone, and then
have the third person in your party attack, so he counter-attacks, then
you counter-attack his counter-attack...I think...and so on. The only
reason I could see this not working is if the Frenzy Band doesn't react
to counter-attacks the enemy performs on you, and only reacts to normal
attacks.

I hope you are able to get the word out about the difference between
the Frenzy Band and Berserker, as the Frenzy Band is VERY useful to
beating down most of the smaller monsters that usually take 2-3 hits
to kill, as well.

P.S. I'm too lazy to proofread

---------
Giga Gaia
---------

From Flamen:

I also have a good way to beat Giga Gaia. If you have a low level
(like 20 -25) Have Marle, Crono, and Ayla. Have marle be the Healer
and crono and Ayla keep doing Falcon Hit. Use Falcon Hit on the arms
first then when they die use it on the head.
It does a HELL of alot of Damage (1000-2000!!!) It'll take him out
in like 5-10 rounds.

The Art Of Selling
------------------

From ryan:

-hi, i downloaded chronotrigger for my zsnes, and i wanted a
walkthrough, and i came across yours.  i noticed that throughout your
walkthrough people would submit tricks that they had, so i wanted to
submit one that i found.  in 65,000,000 bc, when you fight the nu, i
noticed that you get a lot of feathers, horns, etc.  eventually, i
found myself with 99 of each, and i noticed that the aeon blade sold
for 6000 some g, and the magma hand sold for 5000 some g, so i cashed
in all of my extra items that i had gotten from the nu, and turned
them into aeon blades, and magma hands, and when i sold them, i had
about 300,000g!!  with that money, i then went and bought 99 full
tonics, and  99 revives, and still had a ton of money left.  i also
did this when i first went to 65,000,000 bc, and i bought a demon
edge. my prior strongest weapon gave me about 55 or 65 attack power,
and the demon edge raised it to about 95, so i was very powerful. i
just thought that this trick, being very useful, was worth mentioning.
i also wanted to mention that your walkthrough is one of the best ones
i have seen.

--------------------------------------
I'd like to start my own FAQ column...
--------------------------------------

From Loren Jones:

-First I wanted to congratulate you on writing a REALLY good FAQ to
(IMHO) the single best RPG (and probably comsole game) of all time. I
was hoping I could help address some of these questions for you. Just
a bit of background, I have the actual cart (not a rom) that I have
played through (New Game +) at least 7 times. All of my characters are
at ** level (Except for Magus who's at Lvl. 91). I'll put the original
question with my two bits. =)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Do you know what Level ** for chrono is or means. I used the game
genie code because i was curious.  Does it mean that he stays the same
level because he never gains levels, hp, or mp.  i heard it means that
he's on level 99 but why doesn't he hav enough hp and mp. i don't get
it. can u help me out?

A.Lvl. ** is the same as level 99. When your character hits that point
they WILL (barring any cheat codes) have 999 HP & 99 MP. As well as a
few other maxed stats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Arg, with the subquest where you revive Crono, the first part,  the
first doll thing that helps you when it turns into a tree.  Ok, well
the problem is I get behind it, but the wind still blows me away.
I've even leaned against the tree.  Is there any reason for this?

A.When you walk against the wind on Death Peak you stay in place. When
you run you move. Once you've found a nice safe place behind one of
the trees stop running and you'll stay in place instead of slipping
around the trunk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Hey i Jus was Lookin throuGH my old rpgs and i Picked Up CHroNo
trIggER. i started playin it again and i got to magus at the north
cape(second battle.) Well i have always gotton him before when beating
the game but this time i decided to fight him. well i killed him and i
was wondering when the FroG(glenn) would turn back into a human. i have
looked through all the walkthroughs and none of them say n e thing about
when the frog turns bak to glenn if u fight magus. pLeasE write bak
thank your so much.

A.The only time you get to see Glenn as a human again is if you finish
the game immediately after defeating Magus. Otherwise he remains a
frog. (I still haven't figured out how that works.) That's the ONLY
time you'll see him as a human. A really kick ass guy too. Too bad you
can't fight as him.

----------------------------------------
I'd like to start my own Tips section...
----------------------------------------

From PentaroX:

Hey...well, in anticipation of Chrono Cross, I managed to dig up my
copy of Chrono Trigger and beat the game down repeatedly (never gets
boring, eh?).  Then I checked GameFAQs to look and see if there were
any ending listings...at which point I noticed you had a CT FAQ as
well.

Anyhow, ever since I started playing CT again, I've noticed some stuff
which I hadn't before:  (It's summer, I'm bored...'nuff said)

1)  Robo's "Attack changes below 10HP" Crisis Arm is probably the second
best weapon in the game, next to Ayla's BronzeFist.  Give him the Safe
Helm(for the Protect spell), the Nova Armor(to protect status - not the
Moon Armor, since you don't need Mg.Def+10 by level 50-60 anyhow), and the
PrismSpecs, and keep his HP at 999.  You'll deal out more damage normally
than Crono does with a critical.  And if Robo manages to pull off a
critical, you'll deal about 4000-5000 HPs of damage.  Um, that's at level
85, I think.  Ayla does half that with the Iron Fist...and you don't get
the BronzeFist until lv ** anyhow.

"Attack changes below 10HP" means that if the last digit of the HP is 0,
you do 0% of the damage, if the digit is 9, you do 100% (the most)
damage.  Anything in between is a partial percentage of that (HP=1,
~11%...et al).  No, my percentages aren't exactly accurate, but it's
something around there.

2)  Crono's Life spell:  Take Crono's Magic stat.  Multiply that by
ten.  When Crono casts Life, the character he casts it on will recover that
much HP...i.e. if Crono has a magic of 42, you recover 420 HP...with a
magic power of **, you recover 999 hp.  Not that you need Life, if you have
that kind of crazy magic power anyhow.  It's just an excuse for you to dump
Magic Tabs on Crono early on :)

3)  The PrismSpecs ... kick some major butt. =P  I didn't notice this
personally before, AND I know you already mentioned this in your FAQ, but
it ups attack power as well as tech/magic power.  At level 90, I've got
double techs dealing out 6000-9000 with all party members using
PrismSpecs.  Sadly, you only get one set of specs per game :( hehe.

3.5)  The Hero Medal...is a piece of junk.  It wastes your entire Accessory
space just so you can get a couple more crit hits with Frog.  And plus, it
doesn't seem to alter the damage you do on techs...in which case a set of
PrismSpecs is probably in order.  Speaking of which, all the Triple Attacks
which use X-Strike rock. :)  However, if you're not about to fight a boss
any time soon, the Hero Medal *does* come in pretty handy.

4)  The Berserker ups your attack at least as much as the PrismSpecs.  Real
handy.

5)  Give Marle the Siren and Gold Stud.  It makes much more sense that
way..."Stop" is a GREAT perk for that weapon.  Of course, you could always
give her a Valkyrie + PrismSpecs (~800-900 damage per critical), but you
probably want to conserve her MP so you can cast Haste on everybody
anyhow.  Um, and of course remember to give her the Valkyrie before boss
battles.

6)  In that same vein...Lucca, while awesomely powerful with a set of
PrismSpecs, still does mediocre damage most of the time (since the damage
varies way too much with the WonderShot).  I'd give Lucca a Gold Stud,
instead...cast Flare/Mega Bomb/Fire2 repeatedly.

7)  Crono/Marle/Robo is a great combination in earlier, lower-level
games...Lifeline kicks some major butt, since there _is_ no Life 3 spell.

8)  If you feel wacky... run about with Marle/Lucca/Magus.  At each boss,
cast Protect, Haste, and Magic Wall on every character, then begin using
DarkEternal.  Poof...no more boss.

9)  Against Zeal, if you like gambling, bring along Frog, Ayla and someone
who can cast Heal...preferably Robo or something.  Let Zeal use
Hallation.  Ayla uses Dino Tail.  Frog uses Frog Squash.  Robo uses
Heal.  Within the next turn or so, Zeal will use Hallation...AGAIN.  I
don't know why she does this, but it happens to me when I use this combo,
and not when I do anything else.

9.5)  Frog with the Masamune is great against Zeal in general.  First, he
has Frog Squash, which is great against the first incarnation of Zeal (in
the Black Omen), second, the Masamune absorbs energy from the Mammon
Machine, and third, he can cast Heal (which costs a whopping 2 MP without
Studs =P).  Give him the PrismSpecs...I'd suggest Crono/Frog/Ayla, so that
you can Charm stuff off of the second (final) version of Zeal.

10)  Subquests...When you get sent back from 12K BC for the first time, do
the Sunken Forest quest...the tech points come in handy, as well as the
Vigil Hats!...  When Crono dies and you have Epoch flying, do all the other
subquests that you could possibly want to (especially the Northern Ruins,
Sun Stone, and Ozzie's Fort if you have Magus)...for all the weapons, that
is.  By the time you get Crono back, he's nearly useless.

11)  When you play through the first time, always take the PrismSpecs from
Melchior.  Then go through the Black Omen three times (1000, then 600, then
12000BC), and steal a PrismDress from Zeal's left(right, from her point of
view =P) arm each time.  Three dresses per game...not too shabby.

12)  Crono/Ayla's Falcon Hit is spiffy.  Why?  Because it's quick, does
good damage for decent MP (4 each), deals purely physical damage, and hits
on a line (lots of enemies like to line up, mysteriously enough, including
bosses - and Lavos too!).  When you're trying to level to **, waiting for
Techs to finish becomes really old, really fast. ^_~

Phew!  I think that's everything.  Kinda funny, back in '96 I didn't notice
all of this and just ran about with Crono/Marle/Ayla wearing Gold
Studs.  Ha, ha, ha.  *grins*

-OK. I know this will probably take an hour to read, but please read this.
It's all my tips for this game that I have. And since i've already beaten
the game like 25 times, you'll know they come from a good source. Please add
this to the FAQ.

JJL's Tips to Chrono Trigger

Chest collecting: I do NOT recommend getting ANY accessories from the chests
apart from the Gold Stud and Frenzy Band. The reason being is that you never
use the accessories besides the Frenzy Band, Gold Stud, and PrismSpecs
anyways, so they just waste space in your inventory. I personally prefer the
Gold Stud because you'll waste less people's turns recovering MP. This is
just my opinion. What you do is none of my concern. (NOTE: You start with
all your items in NEW GAME+ so don't worry about losing the accessories that
you got. Just something noteworthy. Also, you can use ZSNES save states to
safely take all the chests and keep what you want, E.G., save your state
before opening a chest, then, if you don't want it, load the state and
continue on.)

NEW GAME+: I don't recommend getting any chests in this mode apart from any
types of ethers, megalixers, elixirs, and thats about it. The reason being
is, you keep all your items, so you can just waste your money on inns and to
refill your recovery item supplies. Items also include weapons and armors
that you may have.

Fight with Lavos (third stage): Don't bother going after the active life bit
just at the start. First, take out the healing bit, then the core. Since the
healing bit brings back the core (no, the active life bit doesn't do that),
then just concentrate on obliterating the active life bit. It's really that
easy.

Party recommendations: Don't bother with triple techs. The reason is, once
you get Magus, who is in my opinion the second best character next to Crono,
and my personal favorite, there is no need to use other characters. I
recommend never using Robo, and use Lucca only when you absolutely have to
(no other members to choose from). Same with Robo, only use him when you
have to. Just use Frog with Marle, or Ayla with Marle, until you get Magus.
After that, just use Crono, Magus, and Frog. Crono and Magus's ultimate
single techniques RULE, Frog is the only one with water magic (water not
ice), and Magus also has three level 2 magic spells, making him a great
character. Always have Crono because of Life and Luminaire. Have Frog for
his heal spell. And also, Crono and Frog's Spire and X-Strike techniques
simply rule. So getting triple techniques is nothing but pointless, as you
can see.

OK. So maybe not an hour, but these tips really will help people. I hope
this ends up on the FAQ.

----------------
Nu 'n' Boss Tips
----------------

From Augusto Lenzen:

-Hey Magus, you probably alredy know this but it's not in the FAQ,
so I thought maybe you could be interested. You keep talking about
leveling up in the Hunting Grounds by killing the Nu over and over;
well, I found out a way to always find him before it stops raining,
it could be useful to anyone! Follow these steps:

When you enter the Hunting Grounds, go right, then up and around the
trees, always killing the enemies for the feathers, horns, petals and
fangs that you need to collect for him to appear, then clim up to
the top platform and go left, go down the ramp and avoid the Anions
(it's ok if you can't avoid them too), then stay covered by the trees
and wait for the rain. When it starts, go left until you can see the
place where the Nu should be, if he isn't there, go back right, climb
the ramp and go right. Keep going towards the bottom right location
on the top platform. You'll be able to see the other location from
above while on your way (it's near the ramp you climbed first), so,
if you see the Nu, just go back and down the ramp to face him,
otherwise, just keep going and he'll be waiting for you on the bottom
right of the screen. Once you kill the bastard, go back to where you
avoided the Anions and kill them, then go down, kill the cloaker and
his friends, keep going down and you'll find anoter of those green
things, kill them and go up and to the right till you find one more
of these, kill them (I suggest using cyclone for these ones since
you don't have enough time to return before it starts raining) and
run back to the trees that cover you to wait for the rain and repeat
the process. Notice that by now the screen is clear of all enemies
so you just have to, once you kill the Nu, go back to the trees and
wait for it to rain again, until he doesn't come anymore. Then you
exit the range and do it all over again as many times as you want.
I only wrote this becuse it's really annoying when the damn Nu flees
before you can reach him, and I imagine that everyone feels it so.
And also it saves you a lot of time, so I suggest you put this on
your next version of the FAQ, if you write one. Thanks and see you
around!

It's me again, now just to tell you the way I killed Giga Gaia and Lavos.
Don't need to change your party in any of Lavos' attack modes, just use
Crono, Marle and Lucca, go killing all of them, then for Giga Gaia's mode
(and the real Giga Gaia too, of course), use Luminaire and Flare, and heal
with Marle (don't worry, you have Life 2, so she only needs to heal
herself), if both Crono and Lucca are almost dead, choose one to heal
completely (I'd choose Crono, he's got Life). He'll soon be history, then
get inside. Equip them with Gold Studs, the ones you charmed in the Black
Omen and you'll spend only 5 MP for each Luminaire and Flare that you
use!!!!!! Use the same strategy for Lavos Again.
To kill Lavos' Core just get rid of the left part with Crono and Lucca's
normal attacks while casting haste with Marle (I equiped Crono with a haste
helm, so I only casted it on Lucca first and then Marle). Once the left
part is gone, wait until he shuts off the defense and then beat him up with
Luminaire and Flare (while the core is defended you can use normal attacks
in the body, but your party must be hasted already), the healing is the
same as in Giga Gaia's fight, and if you're still in one piece and have
nothing to do with Marle, fire Ice 2. When he revives the bits, repeat the
process. This way Lavos is a piece of cake, child's play, etc...
See you!!!!!!!

Tip
---

From Ad Infinitum:

-I'm not sure if you still update the guide (the last date on it was
1999), but if you do, there are two small tips I have.  The first is a
way to transfer some money in a New Game +.  Before you start the new
game, go to the old game file and to any store (preferably the Mystics
store if you have done the Ozzie subquest).  Go and buy up all the
expensive weopons and armors you can get.  Now start the New Game +.  Go
to the first vendor you can (someone in the Millenial Fair I guess) and
sell them all.  You now have a great amount of money, that may become
useful later on.
The other tip:  A great place to get tech points at the begining of the
game is the Hunting Grounds, right before or after getting back the Gate
Key.  There are at least three areas that Nus appear there, each
dropping 30 tech points a piece.  They are also great because the fight
is so easy.  Nus, of course, have an attack that reduce your HP to 1.
The thing is, they can't reduce it below that.  It is not possible to
lose a battle to a Nu!  After tech-ing up, go to the trading post and
trade your items in for Flint Edges and Stone Arms.  Then sell these and
buy the weopons and armor at Medina Villiage (this has already briefly
been touched on in the emailed tips section).  Now, with superior armor,
a good weopon for Crono and crushing techniques, you are ready to
destroy Magus, and almost every other enemy up to the Sunken Palace
without cracking a sweat.  Triple Raid on Magus your first time
through?  Ohhh, yeah.  ;)

-------------------------------
I'd like to start my own FAQ...
-------------------------------

From Starship Trooper:

-Hi there, Magus! I'm Starship Trooper (or SST), and I read your Chrono
Trigger FAQ (btw, the game's excellent, I have the snes emulated version, I
wonder if they ever make a PC conversion of the PSX version :)) and now I
wanna comment about some things.

First, I'm not one of those who've finished the game 10+ times, but I still
know lotsa cool tricks. I finished the game once (eating Lavos for
breakfast...), then finished the game with New Game Plus in 6 hours, and it
was way too easy. So I restarted with a normal New Game and right now I'm
trying to get all stats of the guys to ** (max).

About those L+R+A things on the Arris Dome, I never had problems there. And
I had that fog problem on the other comp; just change resolution. Pressing
'3' will help too, but then you won't see the text dialogue. Then about
accessories: why on Earth everyone love PrismSpecs!? I always use Gold
Studs. With them, you can whack the enemies for ages before having to refill
your MPs.

Anyways, to analyze your walkthru (I'll just tell where I disagree and give
boss hints, I'm not making a total walkthrough here):

When I get Marle, I'll go to build my levels to 5+. It's not worth it to get
Lode Sword or the clone yet (sheesh, when I played for the 1st time, I spent
almost 2 hours trying to get 4000G for the Lode thing, you don't need it.
Get the sword from Porre or whatever it was).

When you enter Lucca's invention, you can go to the right pad (NOTE: only in
New Game +) and finish the game in 15 minutes, though it can be quite hard
and you need to have your levels to at least 60.

Against Yakra, just beat it with X Strike and Flame Toss. Heal with tonics
or slurp.

In the jail part, it's up to you to either break and get exp (and heal with
the cell's mug) or wait for the execution, so Lucca will save ya. You should
walk around and go through the hole in the cell. You'll get loads of useful
stuff and the Lode Sword.

Dragon Tank is annoying. Destroy the head with weapons and use Slash and
Flame Toss on the other parts. When you escape to the year 2300, see
chancellor's mouth falling to his feet :)

If you're at level 10-12, the guardian is a laugh. Just kill the bits and
attack the guardian. Repeat when it revives the bits.

If you win against Johhny (you must have race log) with 777 speed, you'll
get a lucky 7 prize: 10 Mid Ethers. When you go to Factory, have
Crono/Lucca/Robo on your party. Robo's cure beam is just enough to heal.
Against the R-Series, whack them with Flame Toss/Whirl and Cyclones. Use
tonics if you need to. They're easy.

At the end of time, you can try to beat Spekkio, but he's damn hard. His
white kilwala form can be defeated with Fire Sword and Heal Beams. Use
pretty much the same tactics against the goblin and omicrone one. You can
also try different Antipode attacks. When Spekkio is on Masa&Mune form, you
should already have ultimate magic attacks like Luminaire, Flare and Dark
Matter. I never got my guys to 99 level to fight the Nu form, but I've heard
that Antipode3 and Flog Flare work pretty well on it.

NUs at the hunting ground are a great way to build up at the starting. I
never built up for levels there though, just spells. Build until you get
Fire2, Lightning2 and Heal Beam if you can. If you've got enough patience,
get Ice2 also. Then go to Medina and the magic cave. Heckran can be dealt
with Fire/Lightning/Ice attacks, and heal up with Aura Whirl.

Zombor is quite easy, just use Fire Sword to the bottom and Ice Sword to the
top. Destroy the bottom first. Then destroy the top. This is because the top
will do MP Buster after you defeat it. Then go recover at inn.

In Denorado, you can get SilverStud. It's very useful until you get your
party full of Gold Studs. Just go on the left (smaller) waterfall and keep
pressing the left button. Woooo!!!! Down you go =) You should land on a
ledge. Silver Stud's all yours.

Use Hypno Wave to stun both Masa and Mune, then attack just one. I think
Fire Sword is good here too. Then they merge into one. Use your best
attacks, but try to save MPs with Crono. You need his slash whenever
MasaMune's storing tornado energy. Heal with Robo's Heal Beam.

In cursed forest, if you see a Nu, get into a fight (if you think you can
handle it) and you'll get lots of EXP from those guys and the Nu you beat.

In 65million BC, all kinda magic attacks are good against the enemies.
Lightning spells are very good against dinosaurs, while Fire2 can really
beat up those annoying runners. Against Nizbel you should use Lightning to
shock it, then attack with your best techs. When it throws lightning back to
you (OWWWW! That hurts!), heal immediately with Robo's Heal Beam and repeat.
This is a very annoying batle.

Before you enter Magus's cave, take Frog to Spekkio (learn Water magic) and
build him until he gets Water 2. At the same time, why don't you take your
time to get Ice 2 for Marle?

I always used Crono/Lucca/Frog at Magus's Castle, but all up to you. I think
someone on the internet counted the number of guards at Magus's Castle;
there ARE 100 freaks like Ozzie said. I haven't tried, but Arc Impulse can
actually be very effective against Sir Slush (it's Slash you slimy dolt! ;))

Use one Fire Whirl to kill those Shadows protecting the treasure. Easy. You
should probably use Crono/Lucca/Marle against Flea too, since Marle can help
Frog in healing. Flea is a transvestite ("she's" a "he", right?) and the
HARDEST boss yet. You get transported to a cool special battle thing. Use X
Strike (and maybe Spire), heal up with Marle and Frog and have tons of heals
(and use them ;)). Ozzie's a wimp. Just hit the chains.

Against Magus, you should use Crono/Lucca/Frog. Keep attacking him with
physical attacks until he sets up a barrier. If he's lightning, hit him with
Crono's lightning. If he's fire, him him with Lucca's fire. If he's ice, use
Frog's water spell. If he's shadow, use Triple Tech Delta Storm. If he's not
ice/water, use Frog's MasaMune to lower his magic defense. When you do 3000+
HP damage to him, he'll start casting spells. Then hit him with physical
attacks and Delta Storm. Use Frog's Heal when he does Dark Matter. This is
kinda hard fight, but you should handle it.

Before you enter Tyrano Castle, have Ayla learn Cat Attack, Charm and Rock
Throw. They sure help a lot. Nizbel2 should be easy, keep using lightning
and your best attacks. I always use Crono/Ayla/Robo against Azala and Black
Tyrano, since Robo has heal beam. Azala's annoying, but Lightning and
physical attacks should eventually kill him. When the Tyrano removes
defense, hit it with Spincut, Cat Attack and Rocket Fist (use Robo Tackle
only if you have lots of MP, you need his Heal Beam). This isn't so hard
battle, but it's very long.

Against 6 NUs at Zeal, use Luminaire or two to finish them all in one. Watch
out! You CAN lose this battle. After a while, the NUs get tired of that
HP-to-1 attack, and they do an attack that reduces 1 HP (You're dead). You
don't have to defeat Golem, but he gives you good amount of EXP. Have fire
protection and use Fire Sword on it, heal with Robo's Heal Beam.

Sewer thing is easy. You should also beat Sir Krawlie easily. Before going
back to 12000, get the stuff from the sealed chests (remember, first go to
600 AD and say "no", then open the upgraded chest at 1000 AD, then go back
to 600 AD to get the item again). You'll also get GoldStud from the Future.
I don't think you can get Red Mail (upgraded Red Vest), since you can't get
to 1000 AD Guardia Castle yet. On the pyramid near Medina, take the helmet.
Give it to Lucca, and she won't need a better helmet until you get Vigil
Hats. It also gives her 1/3 physical protection.

Against the Mud Imp and the beasts, use Fire on the Blue Beast and Ice on
the Red Beast. You did it all wrong at your FAQ. Crono/Marle/Lucca are good
here. Luminaire (remember to wear a Gold Stud) is very good too. At Mt. Woe,
you can get your levels to around 40. Giga Gaia is fast (he has ** speed
stats?) but easy. Use Luminaire and a level 2 spell to destroy the hands
(again, Gold Stud lets you use Luminaire almost 20 times), then go for the
creature. When it revives the hands, destroy them with one Luminaire. It
should die soon.

You should beat Dalton easily. At the Ocean Palace, have Crono/Lucca/Marle
on your party. Before you get to the end of the Ocean Palace, take all
Crono's best equipment away, and give Gold Stud to Lucca. Flare will hurt it
kinda lot, and its counterattacks against Fire are weak (especially if you
have Ruby Vests). If you use Flare, Ice2 and Lightning2 continously, you can
beat it even before it has a chance to mimic anything. If this isn't New
Game Plus, Lavos will most likely kill you with one "Destruction rains from
the Heavens" -strike. Even if this is New Game +, he's still VERY hard.

Before you get captured by Dalton, put at least Ayla to your party. You can
get almost all your equipment back by walking around. You have to get the
first character's equipment from the air duct though (it's on the west
corner, there's a sleeping guard).

Golem Boss doesn't do anything. If you kill it fast enough, you'll get loads
of EXP. Since it's afraid of height, feel free to use Rock Throw on it.
Dalton's a wimp too. You shouldn't fight Magus, killing the game's best
character just to see Frog as a human is quite a BIG mistake. If you fight
him though, he's not that hard, unlike you said. Douplev Bomb (Lucca and
Robo) and Triple Kick should kill him. If you have the duel between Frog and
Magus, use Leap Slash or physical attacks. Use Cure2 when you need to. But
all the better if you don't fight him.

After Gaspar gives you the Chrono Trigger, go to Belthasar's place and talk
to the Nu. It will tell you that you need a clone, and that magician Bekkler
can easily make one. And Bekkler loves festivals.... so go to the millenial
fair. You don't even have to collect silver points. Save before you enter
the tent of horrors (in case you lose), and he says he'll make a clone of
Crono, if you play his clone game, and the longer you survive, the less
he'll ask. If you fail, it'll cost you a lot (around 10.000G and 50.000G I
think), but if you win (actually that's kinda easy, this game is actually
easier than what the clone game normally is), you'll get the clone for 100%
free. =)

I don't know what's the point of shutting off Nu and Belthasar's memories.
Anyway, Death Peak is a cool place to build up. I got Magus up with many
techs there, and all guys to level 45+. Frog with Demon Hit is good here,
since it will do 2* damage on magic enemies. Ayla and Robo are other good
characters. Lavos Spawns shouldn't be a problem, just attack the head with
your best physical techs. Put Marle on your team before you reach the top of
the mountain ;)

Build Magus until he gets the Black Hole, and go fight the Son of Sun at
2300 AD Sun Palace. Be sure to have fire protection. Use Black Hole until
you succeed in removing 2 of the front flames. Use any level 2 spell to hit
the flames. Then hit the one that doesn't counter attack. When it does
roulette shuffle, repeat that.

You should bring Magus (you?) to Ozzie's hideout. It's cool, since he uses
his cool arrogant sarcastic personality here to totally piss Ozzie and his
cowards off. You'll get Magus's best weapons here too. Be prepared for lots
laughs for coward Ozzie and his stuff :P First, his guards fall from a
conveytor belt, then an imp falls to his trap, and finally a cat kills him.
And Magus makes his "Sound of a Reaper" talk here too. You should try Omega
Flare (Magus/Robo/Lucca with Blue Rock) here.

Cyrus ghost quest is hard and long, but you can get some cool stuff here
too. Watch out for Cyrus's ghost at 1000 AD, it's invincible. Water attacks
are great at the sunken Fiona's desert, so have Marle, Frog and Magus on
your team. Use water/ice attacks on the retinite and use physical attacks to
weakened parts. This is a hard battle. Get Vigil Hats from the nun at
Fiona's Shrine. It took me some time to figure that the password to the
machine (LARA) can be done with snes keys "L", "A", "R" and "A".

Rainbow Shell quest is long and hard. In Giant's Claw, you can find Frenzy
Band (80% counter attack rate) and lots of hard fights, but this can be a
good place to build up. Get fire protection and beat up the Rust(y) Tyrano
with your best attacks. Before you get back to 600 AD Guardia Castle to get
help in carrying the Rainbow Shell, switch Magus to your leader. They won't
react to Magus visiting the castle at all. The queen says "I ask for the
sake of Magus, help them" =) [sake of the first character] Antipode 3 works
well against Yakra 13 I think, but don't hesitate to use Dark Eternal
(Marle/Magus/Lucca with Black Rock). If this is not New Game Plus, take
Prism Helms. They protect your status and give you a great boost on magic
defense. You can charm PrismDresses from Queen Zeal later. I still prefer
Gold Studs over the PrismSpecs, but PrismSpecs can be useful until you charm
more Gold Studs from Flyclops of Black Omen.

You should have no problems with Robo's Past quest, just remember to build
up there, the conveyor belt gives lotsa EXP. This is strange, since "Someone
close to you needs help..... find this person FAST" and "Find out how Black
Omen is connected to Lavos" are the same quest. You can go to Black Omen 3
times (starting from 1000 AD, then 600 AD and 12000 BC, while 2300 AD is
closed), getting lots of EXP, MegaElixirs, charmed stuff and of course 3
Prism Dresses from Queen Zeal (1 Black Omen=1 PrismDress). Charm from
Ruminators, Flyclops and other enemies. Mutants are hard, but you should
handle them with Heal Beam, elixers and strongest magic spells. Use the best
physical techs against the Lavos Spawn head.

Queen Zeal is hard. Have Frog there, Froq Squash is great against first Zeal
(Hallation) and MasaMune absorbs energy from Mammnon Machine. Again, using
Magus is cool here, since he'll throw another sarcastic line and you'll get
Magus Theme when fighting Zeal. Charm both hands and attack the head only.

You get a chance to do things between each Lavos battle. You said MasaMune
and Magus are hard, but actually all the clones are wimps. Kill Dragon Tank
with weapons, do the same for Guardian (first kill the bits), use Magic on
Heckran (Marle, Lucca and Magus or Frog are good here), Ice/Fire Sword
against Zombor, physical attacks and Slash on MasaMune and Lightning and
best physical attacks on Nizbel (With 99+ magic defense, the lightning he
throws back hardly does 10 HP of damage).

Magus is great against.... uh.... Lavos's Magus form. You can counter any of
his barrier with his magic attacks. When he starts casting spells and does
Dark Matter (hardly does 20 HP of damage if you have 99+ magic defense),
give him a taste of a TRUE Dark Matter, and Magus will do around 2000 HP
damage to the imposter ;)

Giga Gaia form is easy; Luminaire, Flare, Shock or Dark Matter with
GoldStuds (to keep up MPs) will kill it very quickly. Against the real shell
form, use those spells I mentioned above. Heal with Robo's Heal Beam. I
don't care who'll lead in the final battle, but make 2nd character Lucca,
and 3rd characters Robo. In the Final Battle, leader is at the middle, 2nd
character at left and 3rd at right. Your leader character should be Crono or
Magus. If you killed Magus and didn't revive Crono (that's dumb), Ayla can
do with her Triple Kicks.

Anyway, use Luminaire/Dark Matter, Flare and Shock against the World
Revolution form. If you have Magus on your team, you can also try Omega
Flare with Blue Rock. Now it's time to beat Lavos Core. If you think you can
handle it (should work if you're at around level 60), use physical attacks
to kill the left bit. Before the right bit can revive any bit, it shuts off
its core. Then use DouplevBomb and (This works if Lucca's 2nd and Robo's
3rd, since Robo's next to the right Lavos bit. This will do 4000+ HP damage.
Even more than 7500 HP at level 99 I've heard) Luminaire/Dark Matter on the
right bit. It will revive the left bit, but just keep using Douplev Bomb and
Luminaire/Dark Matter, though remember to heal with Robo's Heal Beam. When
it restores the core power, kill the left bit with physical attacks and do
the same again. Lavos should die pretty soon.

----------
Impatient?
----------

From Ben:

-Here are some things you'd like to take note of if you're an
impatient yet honourable (no cheats =p) player who wants to finish
things faster. Most of this is common sense, but just thought I'd
point out everything.

Settings
--------
If you're using ZSnes, set frame rate to 9. Think this can be done in
SNES9X as well. Do not do this in areas with extremely frustrating
opponents or bosses with lots of counterattacks or resistances/
immunities to lots of your attacks.

Set cursor to memory for all settings, whether menu or battle.

Equipment
---------
The Lode Sword sold by Melchior is helpful but not necessary. Even
with the frame rate set to 9 and with a Turbo A Button, it took
quite a while to earn enough Silver Points to get the 4000 GP
required. Since you can get one later from the dungeon where Crono
is imprisoned anyway, I suggest that you skip this.

Berserkers are surprisingly good for quick level building. It ups
your attack, defence, and speed and removes any need to issue
commands. The speedup is tremendous to the point where you'll
usually get the 1st blow in. Combine this with Haste Helms and a
frame rate of 9 and you'll see combats end in the blink of an eye.

I recommend Berserkers for your party members most of the time,
with Gold and Silver Studs for boss fights. I found little use
for the other stuff in my rush for speed (get it? =p)

Tackling Bosses
---------------
When it comes to party members, keep either Frog or Robo since
they are the only ones with single techs that heal the entire
party. Once they have Nova Armour, equip them with Haste Helms.
Once you have done this, with the Cursor set to Memory for
Battle Mode, all you need to do is to select the most powerful
attacks for your other members and hold on the Turbo A button.
At a frame rate of 9, you won't need to sit through the battle
for long.

For the fights with Zeal and the Mammon Machine, you might want
Ayla and Frog since Dino Tail and Frog Squash do lots of damage
after every single round of Halation. For the 1st round with
Queen Zeal, wait till Zeal throws Halation. After that, assign
Ayla to use Dino Tail and Frog using Frog Squash. If you have
Robo, get him to use his Heal Beam after every Halation.
Failing that, you can get someone to throw a Lapis, or you can
get Frog to Heal. All you need to do is to throw one round of
healing after the Halation to keep your HP low enough to have
Dino Tail and Frog Squash at maximum effectiveness since you
probably would be high level enough to survive one or two of
her other attacks anyway. Healing to max is a waste of actions
and MP since she'll throw Halation quite frequently.

This can be done for the Mammon Machine as well. Just make
sure that you have enough HP to withstand it's Point Blank and
Active Mode attacks. Otherwise, let your HP stay low and pound
away with Dino Tail and Frog Squash.

For the rematch with Queen Zeal, let Frog Heal every round and
use single attacks on the head.

I finished this at level 55-65 with minimum pain and with one
finger on the Turbo A button most of the time. No sweat.

Level Building
---------------
First time you have access to 65,000,000 BC, if you're not
hunting for Feathers, Petals and stuff, it'll be quicker to
keep attacking the group of 4 Kilwala you encounter on your
trip out of the Mystic Mountains. Make sure your most
(physically) powerful team member has a Berserker.
Recommendations are in this order: Ayla, Crono, Robo, Frog,
Magus. Killing 4 groups of Kilwala will give you more XP and
32 tech pts, compared to one Nu. You also won't need to
trouble yourself running around looking for the Nu. Threat
level is low as well... all you need to do is to peek at the
screen every once in a while and make sure no one's dying. To
make this even more convenient, set a button as Turbo A (i.e,
Turbo Confirm) and find some way to hold it down. Then, all
you need to do is walk in and out of the Mystic Mountains as
soon as you hear the battle theme end. This is for the times
when you really need some quick levels and you have no
patience to go Nu hunting (like me =p).

Repeat this tactic at Magus's castle on the West Wing where
you confront Slash for some free Ethers as well.

At the Ocean Palace, there is a section with lots of items and 3
switches required to open a pathway to the south. 2 of the Switches
are guarded by a Barghest/Jinn combination. Under each of these rooms
with the Switches, there should be a group of 3 Scouts. With
Berserkers, these should be easy prey. If I'm not mistaken, you get a
free Lapis as well.

IMHO, the best place for getting load of XP for minimum effort is
still at the GenoDome, on the conveyor belt when you come in. Almost
9K XP for one round through the belt, and the threat level is not
really high. For lower levels, I recommend bringing Crono or Magus and
throwing Lightning 2 every round. Give either one of them a Haste
Helm if you have one, and a Gold Stud. Set the others to Attack. With
this, you can just hold on to Turbo A and watch as Crono or Magus
thrashes the entire squad with one Lightning 2. With the Gold Stud,
this costs only 2 MP and with 5 fights, you use up only 10 MP per
go on the conveyor belt. For higher levels and those aiming to
confront level 99 Spekkio, give everyone Haste Helms and Berserkers.
Robo is compulsory, so for your other party members, pick Ayla and
anyone else you might fancy. Ayla with a Haste Helm and a Berserker
makes the run end so much sooner, and at frame rate 9, it took me
only 3 or 4 hours to bring everyone to level 99 from a mostly level
60-70 party.

BTW, a question if I may:
What's the max damage possible with any technique and how do I do
it? Highest I've gotten is 9999 as a critical from Ayla at level
99. DC: Yup, that's it!

Rusty
-----

From kozak:

-hmm... you got a pretty good FAQ here but i can add on a bit, it
wount mean much but you could take on the rust tyrano before the son
of suns, grab an extra red mail so that you can whack the son of
suns with 2 red mails and 1 red vest. i did that and i purposely
whack the thing in the middle so it would do flare and i gain hp. it
is cool, but i think the son of suns is too easy that it is not
necessary to do that... but anyway, it would be even easier.

Error
-----

From ^^rabblion:

-Hi Magus.

I would like to point out some errors in your walkthrough about
Frog's triple techs. I use Frog in every party line up so I am
familiar with almost all his techs =)

Gold Rock - Frog/Marle/Robo
Name: Grand Dream
Effect: Marle and Robo charge up Frog's Masamune and Frog uses it
to summon 3 Masa & Mune to stomp on all enemies, dealing a lot of
physical damage.Requires: Upgraded Masamune for Frog, Life 2 (not
sure about this one) for Marle, Laser Spin for Robo and a Gold Rock
equipt on Frog.

SilverRock - Frog/Robo/Ayla
Name: Spin Strike
Effect: Robo and Ayla spin around an enemy while Frog leaps into the
air, then they attack the enemy from 3 sides, this tech deals
physical damage. Requires Leap Slash for Frog, Robo Tackle for Robo,
Tail Spin for Ayla and a SilverRock equipt on either one of the
characters.

That's all =)

-------------
Mud Wrestling
-------------

From mike pirrota:

-Fist off, if you want to beat the Mud Imp itself, use
Volt Bite.  Lightning and Cat Attack do next to
nothing to him, but I hit him for 966 points once with
it.  Secondly, against those 6 Nu's, bring Chrono,
Ayla, and Robo.  Have Robo use Heal Beam, or Laser
Spin(I did this on a regular New Game, so you might
want to use a different everybody attack in + mode) if
nobody if injured, and have the other two use Falcon
Hit. That party combo also works good most of the
time, with Chrono and Ayla attacking and Robo healing
during bosses and just pure attacks against regular enemies.

------
Racing
------

From William Low:

-I don't know if you knew this or if someone else had already done
this but if you race Johnny in 2300 AD in the time (or WP) of 777 you
get a special message that says "WOW lucky 777 you deserve a REALLY
special bonus" and then you get 10 ethers. Just thought I'd mention
it.

------------------------------------
Rubble, Rubble, Rubble, Rubble, etc.
------------------------------------

From Tiger Webb:

-There is a reoccuring rubble on the mountain of woe, which gives
you a lot of exp and tech points. Anyhoos, I got up to Level ** (99?)
with Chrono, and wiped the floor with the rest of the game.
It's location is(as soon as you defeat the mud imp and go up for the
first time) left, up all the way, climb, right a bit, up all the way,
right.

12)Codes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I think they're Game Genie codes. No, they're PAR codes. I didn't do
them, JJL did. He's a champ. Thank him! HE's done a lot of
work to work all of these out.

First off, those weren't GG codes. They were Pro Action Replay codes.
Second, if you have ZSNES, you just go into the cheat menu and click
add code. That is all, oh, by the way, if you see a value for a code
just add the value to the end of the code.
E.G. C1FA70 value FF = C1FA70FF.

Get it? Good.

C1DCEE98     Party and enemies do much more damage when attacking
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1DCEE9E     Party and enemies are invincible
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1E10077     Nonmagic attacks do very little damage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1E23077     Magic attacks do high damage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1EC9EA0     All enemies die instantly when you attack; battle will
             not end
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1ECBE3B     All enemies die with one hit and will die if they attack
             you. Party is healed after battle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

C1F79B87     Maxes out all atributes (i.e. power, magic, speed) for
             characters in party.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C1F7F4C6     Characters in party go to level 99 after one battle! It
             says you get the normal amount of exp, but you go to
             level 99. If you aready used the max stats code, this
             code is still worth using since the game uses your level
             number when figuring damage and defence in battle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
C2E2B59A     "Walk anywhere on the map screen" While on the map you
             can move your characters anywhere. But, be careful
             because there is a chance might get stuck and can't move.
             Also, this code was tested with Crono leading the party.
             It may or may not work with other characters in the lead.
