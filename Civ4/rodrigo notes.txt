CITIES
==========

Science Cottage - Oxford
------------------------
- Full grassland, 20 pop, 10+ cottages, ideally 15+
- Rivers are great, the more the better: +1C, Watermill -> Cottage. Found at river for Levee
- Some Grasshills welcome: Mine -> Windmill -> Cottage
- 1 beefy food resource. 2 is nice, 3 is overkill. Only enough to counter non-grassland or production features
	+4: Corn*, Wheat*, Fish, Pig
	+3: Banana**, Clam, Crab, Deer, Rice*, Sheep (+1C)
	+2: Cow (+2P), Sugar (+1C), Floodplains***
	*: -1F if farm is not irrigated, +1F with Biology
	**: Requires Calendar, a bit far from start
	***: Not a resource, but a terrain feature that happens on desert only.
	     0 from tile + 3 from feature + 1 from farm = 4 = +2 surplus
- Gems are perfect: +6C (only 1 short of a full Town with Free Speech), and nice +1P (+1P if grass hill)
- Production is hard: via forrest chops, grassland mines/windmills/towns, plains. Cows, Horse, Ivory also helps
- Heavily dependent on Slider
- National Wonders
	- Oxford
	- Palace [+8C > +1 full cottage]. Optional
	* Academy [Great Scientist]

Holy Gold - Wall Street
-----------------------
- Holy City. Possibly the Capital.
- Double Holy is amazing. Triple is unrealistic.
- National Wonders:
	- Wall Street

GPP Farm
--------
- Floopplains, Beefy Food resources
- Health will be issue, so: River (Aqueduct, also commerce), Coastal (harbor) if few costal/sea titles. And keep forests.
- River for Levee is important
- Preferably not the capital: early game will suffer from few cottages, mid game will suffer from low hammers
- GPP are about food *surplus*, not huge pop. Keep pop within health cap
- National Wonders:
	- National Epic (+4C, +1GPP[GA]) - +100% GPP
	- Globe Theater (+6C, +1GPP[GA]) - No Unhappiness, allows 3 artists

- River (levee and health)
- National Wonders
	- Heroic Epic [+100% Military Production]
	- West Point [+4XP]

RESOURCES
============
- Coal is *only* needed for a fully operational IronWorks (and IronClad). For everything else Oil is can be used.
- Power *itself* gives -2H *regardless* of source, even if clean. Three Gorges Dam gives power regardless if factory is built
- Factory + Coal + Oil = -5H even if power is clean, plus -2H for the power, plus -2H if unclean.
- Avoid in Fat Cross:
	Sugar
- Best Food:
	+4: Corn*, Wheat*, Fish, Pig
	+3: Banana**, Clam, Crab, Deer, Rice*, Sheep (+1C)
	+2: Cow (+2P), Sugar (+1C), Floodplains***
	*: -1F if farm is not irrigated, +1F with Biology
	**: Requires Calendar, a bit far from start
	***: Not a resource, but a terrain feature that happens on desert only.
	     0 from tile + 3 from feature + 1 from farm = 4 = +2 surplus
- Gems are perfect: +6C (only 1 short of a full Town with Free Speech), and nice +1P (+1P if grass hill)


WONDERS
============

Mandatory
---------
- Stonehenge [Free Monument +1 Culture] - Easy, AI does not prioritize
- Parthenon [+50% GPP] (if Philosphical)
- Great Library
- Pyramids for Representation (specially if Specialist Economy) - ONLY if Stone
- Sinergy: University of Sankore (science) + Spiral Minaret (gold) + Apostolic Palace (hammers)
- Statue of Liberty [+1 free specialist on all cities in the continent]

Great
---------

- Shwedagon Paya [all Religious civics]

CORPORATIONS
============
- [MANDATORY]: Sid's Sushi - Food and Culture: Rice, Fish, Crab, Clam. Cereal Mills is a poor alternative.
- [MANDATORY]: Mining Ing  - Hammers
- Both for private use, do not spread to AI
- Civilized Jewlers - Culture, near-zero sum gold, the best for foreing use: spread to AI, they pay maintenance, you reap gold in HQ
- Found as many compatible ones in Wall Street / Holy city.
- Either Sid's Sushi + Mining Ing and no other Corp, or found MiningInc at another city and leave Wall Street to Sushi's + others.
