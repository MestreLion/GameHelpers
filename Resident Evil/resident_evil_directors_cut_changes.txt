Disclaimer...

Well there is no disclaimer for the FAQ...I dont care what you do with it! Heck 
I dont care if its put up on a Porno Site! You can print this and Distrubute it. 
I really dont care. There is only one rule you cannot try to make money off of 
selling this (I dont know who would be dumb enought to buy it though)


********************
Why Am I Doing this?
********************

If you are like me, a HUGE RE Fan, you may have Resident Evil 1 already, but 
you've seen Director's Cut for a really cheap price somewhere and are debating 
weither to get it or not. This will explain the differences from the orignal 
version of Resident Evil.

This may also be used as help. For Example if you already played Resident Evil 
and know everything, but the little modifications throw you off, this will help 
you locate some of the changes in the Locations of Items.

             -[ CHANGES IN -> FUNCTIONS/ENEMIES ]-

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Auto-Aim
--------
RE: In the orignal this feature doesn't exist, you had to manually Aim for an 
enemy.
DC: In this version a new very useful feature is added, now with your character 
the gun will automatically aim at enemies, may make it too easy for people that 
like challenges.


In Resident Evil: Director's Cut, there is more enemies than the orignal, 
perhaps to make it so it isn't too easy to use the Auto-aim feature. You may 
find new enemies in unexpected locations.

      -[ SHOULD YOU BUY RESIDENT EVIL: DIRECTOR'S CUT ]-

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide is intended to help you to decide if buying Resident Evil: Director's 
Cut is exactly worth it or not. 

You should buy it if:
- You are a hardcore Resident Evil Fan
- If you do not own the orignal Resident Evil
- If you think that all the extra features are worth the money
- You find a copy extremely cheap!

You shouldn't buy it if:
- You aren't a fan of the Resident Evil Series
- You do not think all the new features are worth the time
- You already have Resident Evil and dont think this version is worth   it.

I honestly would think that Resident Evil: Director's Cut is worth it no matter 
if you have the Resident Evil 1 CD or not, But it's up to you to decide if it is 
worth it!
