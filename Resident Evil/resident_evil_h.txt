 1.0 - Guide completed to the best of my ability. Everything I
       could think of covering is in here. If this guide is
       added to GameFAQ's and doesn't have a dot beside it
       saying it's a full guide I'll be surprised.

       Anything I've messed up, are missing, or whatever I'll
       be glad to know about. I could only manage the time to
       replay the game once through with both Chris and Jill
       most of this relied upon old notes and my memory. I'm
       confident I have 99% of everything correct.


 0.5 - Guide begun in the middle of 2001. With the announcement
       of the Biohazard remake, the guide project was stopped.
       On the near release of the remake I felt nostalgic and
       decided to finish up the guide.

 1.2 - Introduction
 -------------------

 Resident Evil.

 These words most PlayStation owners have heard. Probably most
 Dreamcast, Nintendo, PC, and various other gamers also. :-D It
 doesn't mean all of them like the game but most people I know
 have played it and liked it. Okay, well yes I need more
 friends who don't. I do enjoy other games beside it, but
 Resident Evil is my favorite game. Of course that wasn't the
 case when I first saw it in 1996.

 I was one of the people who didn't think it was a great game.
 I saw it at a local electronics store, and thought it was
 stupid. I watched as the nervous looking store clerk exclaimed
 how the game was doing so well in the USA. I watched as a
 balding old man, probably in his mid-to-late forties control
 Chris across the 2nd floor of the dining room, yelling that he
 had no idea what to do while saying it was one of the best
 games he had seen. To me it looked like another 3rd Person
 adventure game I didn't want to touch. I decided to continue
 on, and left the store to do something else with my dollar.
 While I was there I never saw a single zombie, or any of the
 FMV, and so only assumed the game sucked. Boy was I wrong.

 About a week later, I was around at my friends house. Both my
 friend and my friend's brother were raving about this game.
 Seeing as this was the first time I had heard the title,
 Resident Evil, I had no idea that it was the same game I had
 seen at the store. He brought it in and showed it to me.
 Looking at the back cover I realized it was the same game, but
 after hearing stuff about it I decided to give it a shot.
 After seeing what lead up to where I had seen the old man
 playing, I had decided I liked it. And that's where the
 Resident Evil Legacy started for me.

 And so here I am, over six years later, writing a FAQ devoted
 to Resident Evil, the game that started it all, in all it's
 various incarnations on other systems, and it's remake on
 Gamecube. This is my favorite game, both in the series and
 ever, and I feel ashamed that I've never attempted anything to
 show this (okay so maybe I have my website... but it's there
 to cover everything).

 So... Yes. I'm writing another Resident Evil guide to add to
 the pile of guides already available on the net. Why? Well
 basically it's my attempt at trying a guide on a well known
 game. Besides the fact that I'm going to cover every format of
 the game available at this time.

 So why did I begin this project? Well it has it's origins in
 a couple of things. Besides the fact RE1 is still my fav,
 sometime in the early part of 1999 I wrote a couple of guides
 for both Jill's and Chris' scenarios in Resident Evil. It's
 was very rough being my first ever guide writing. The basis
 of this guide is on that original guide, edited and added too
 though. *whew!*

 The other day, while being nostalgic with my old files, I came
 across these guides and with the remake in mind decided that I
 wanted to make a major guide to all versions which I could
 share with Resident Evil fans. And with this I believe I could
 show something worthwhile.

 Okay, so what should you expect from this guide that others
 don't? Well I will strive to give this guide completeness for
 all versions, something which other guides don't have, it will
 also be my version of it, so it's always good to have
 something new to look at. Should you hate this guide and then
 want something else (speed guides or think there is a guide
 just plain better than this one) then I suggest you go ahead
 and use it instead, but as most people say, don't knock it
 until you try it. :-P

 I'll leave this as is, and just add more notes when they
 spring to mind, other than that I hope this guide can be of
 help to those who are just entering the world of Survival
 Horror, or those who are returning for another go.

 Good Luck,
 - Rob

                               Also fit for this section.

 // Game History

 Rumors had been circulating. Capcom was having losses in the
 industry due to poor reception of more sequel's. Sure Street
 Fighter was good, but the series was starting to loose it
 shine. Capcom needed a hit and they needed it quickly. The
 latest next generation console, the PlayStation, being made
 by newcomers to the console scene, Sony, who were only known
 at the time for other general electrical goods seemed to be
 the best choice as they had lined up various other games for
 the console. It was one that wouldn't be regretted by Capcom.

 Biohazard (Resident Evil) was originally envisioned as a
 First Person shooter then later a two player game. Due to
 restrictions of the console, that idea was put off for both
 of these ideas. The origins of the game come down to a few
 things. Mostly the various Zombie movies made through the
 years, and an old game on the Nintendo Entertainment System
 called Sweet Home. This game was based in a mansion full of
 monsters, where there was also booby traps and surprise
 scares all around. Although it wasn't related to Biohazard
 in anyway, the game did give inspirations to the creators
 (Connections are also made between Resident Evil and the
 original Alone In The Dark. Although there are questions as
 to if this really had anything to do with the planning of
 the title).

 Planning and development went forward. Many who saw the game
 early said it was a sure fire hit. The game was continually
 making headlines even before it was finished. Biohazard
 (Resident Evil) was released in 1996, and the success it
 gained was unimaginable. The game breathed a new lot of
 atmosphere, coined a new genre' (Survival Horror) and was so
 good that it was voted PlayStation game of the year for 1996
 by the US public. Even with all this good stuff going on,
 there was a lot of rage from fans who found out the opening
 video had been cut from it's original version.

 During the next year, people screamed for a sequel. Along
 with that, due to public demand Capcom released a version for
 the Sega Saturn, and with Virgin Interactive's help, a PC
 version also. Resident Evil was also re-released twice on
 PlayStation, as a not-so Directors Cut, and Dual Shock
 Versions. On the cards until early in 2000 was a Game Boy
 version, but this was scrapped due to the game not living up
 the standards of what Capcom wanted out of it.

 With 2002 Capcom has released a remake of the original, a
 "remake" that isn't really just a remake but has enough new
 material to be considered a new game.

 2.2 - Story Blurb
 ------------------

 A missing team and helicopter. Mysterious cannibal murders. A
 mansion located in the middle of a forest. Strange creatures.
 A hidden mysterious secret. What is the Resident Evil?

 A series of gory attacks in the area surrounding a remote
 biotech lab brings in S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue
 Squad) to investigate. On arrival, Bravo Team communications
 are abruptly cut off. Now it's up to your team.

 You arrive at the isolated mansion under-powered and on the
 run. Arm yourself with anything you can find: knives, pistols,
 shotguns, and flame-throwers - search for hidden rounds to
 stay alive!

 There are puzzles to solve, traps to disarm, and mysteries to
 uncover while trying to avoid a blood bath with the freaks of
 nature that populate the mansion. Each lurking horror you
 survive brings you closer to the source of the "Resident Evil"

 2.3 - Characters
 -----------------

 // Alpha Team

 2.3.1     | Barry Burton
 -----     | Age: 38
           | Height: 6 ft (186 cm)
           | Weight: 197 lbs. (89.3 kg)
           | Blood Type: A
           | Assignment: Weapons Specialist

 Chris Redfield's old friend and partner. Former SWAT team
 member, Barry maintains and supplies weapons for all
 S.T.A.R.S. members. He had over 16 years of experience, and
 has lead many projects to success. Barry is a trusted ally,
 but has had some trouble with his wife and 2 daughters
 recently. He may look or sound depressed at times.

 Barry acts very strange for the good reason that you shall
 find out while playing Resident Evil. Of course the first
 thing you seem to notice about him is that he's quite clumsy
 and does many  very stupid things during the game. I think the
 idea was that he was like this because of the stress he's
 under, but instead it comes across as it being the way he is
 and you can't help but laugh at the things he does or says
 (master of lockpicking comes to mind right now).

 Of course you also can't help but feel that Barry is a great
 help in certain situations, especially when Jill is in a lot
 of trouble. You'll find he comes to her rescue very often
 while exclaiming "What IS this?" and perhaps killing anything
 that might be a threat to Jill or himself. It's actually
 something you'll notice often with Barry, his overstatements
 on things or the repeat usage of 'what is this'. Yet again
 something I laugh at often during the game.

 Being a member of the N.R.A. he cares deeply about his gun and
 the use of guns, but that care is overshadowed even more for
 love of his wife & children which comes first, and the
 welfare of his fellow teammates secondly. It seems Barry is
 very much a person to help out his team mates, but as I
 mentioned earlier it might not be of as much help as it should
 be.

 During the first part of Jill's game (the only scenario he
 appears in) he'll turn up quite often as you search the
 mansion for clues. He may even give you a weapon or ammo in
 order to help you around the mansion. As the game goes on
 Barry will turn up in vital moments and help you on the quest
 to finding the answers to what is going on through clues he
 and items that he finds around the mansion.

 You'll never get to play as Barry, which is a real shame, but
 during the game he'll be using a Magnum ("I HAVE this!") and
 Flame-thrower as weapons.

 On a side note, Ash Jhonen runs an interesting little website
 devoted to Barry Burton called "A Bevy of Barry" at
 http://badassbarry.evilgaming.net. It's worth your time to
 check out.

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
            Barry appears in a small cameo role as the pilot of
            the rescue helicopter in one of the two endings. He
            also appears as one of the epilogue file characters
            which explains why he appears in the game.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.2    | Joseph Frost
 -----    | Age: 27
          | Height: 5 ft 10 in (179 cm)
          | Weight: 159 lbs. (72.3 kg)
          | Blood Type: B
          | Assignment: Vehicle Specialist

 Previous member of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, and already
 stationed in Raccoon City, Joseph was recently promoted to
 serve as vehicle specialist for Alpha Team. Many members of
 Bravo Team are jealous of his promotion, but he was moved up
 by Wesker himself, Joseph is young, enthusiastic and very
 curious.

 Well, what can I really say about Joseph Frost. Well honestly,
 there is nothing much really. He dies at the start, by being
 pounced upon by the cerberus in the open area near the
 mansion. At least Joseph gave the rest of the team a warning
 about the approaching dogs and, if you can see the uncut
 version of the opening, then you get to see his shotgun skills
 and gory death... Perhaps with RE Zero we might learn some
 more about him. Perhaps not.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.3    | Chris Redfield
 -----    | Age: 25
          | Height: 5 ft 11 in (181 cm)
          | Weight: 177 lbs. (80.5 kg)
          | Blood Type: O
          | Assignment: Marksman

 After being kicked out of the Air Force, Chris became a
 drifter until he met Barry Burton. Barry recruited him for the
 newly formed S.T.A.R.S. Now Chris has been reassigned to a
 smaller unit at Raccoon City headquarters to prove himself
 quickly. Chris is a tough guy who possesses both a strong
 mentality and great vitality.

 Chris is the main male character in Resident Evil and also the
 harder option of the two main characters in the game.
 Personality wise, he does seem to come across as being quite
 dense at various times during the game, like he wouldn't know
 what was happening, but I'd have to say that he is quite the
 opposite, much smarter that he looks. Chris has a very
 protective role over people, especially females, such as Jill
 and his sister Claire, though there isn't much of a given
 chance to show this in Resident Evil. Chris is also a smoker,
 but due to censorship the opening video scenes were removed
 from the US and European PlayStation versions. You can find
 the uncensored opening online if you look around and it is
 included in some PC versions.

 Because Resident Evil has a lot less character development
 than a lot of titles out there, finding a real focus on
 characters can be a problem, for example we never find out why
 Chris was kicked out of the Air Force for, and can only
 speculate from other reports. Chances are, from the details of
 Jill's Diary in Resident Evil 3, Chris has a anger problem and
 this could have resulted in him leaving the air force.

 Chris has a general assortment of weapons during Resident
 Evil, from a combat knife, you can also get a Beretta Handgun,
 Shotgun, Magnum, Flame Thrower and Rocket Launcher. Details on
 each of the weapons can be found in the weapons section.

 Chris holds less items than Jill (6 instead of Jill's 8) and
 this makes the game harder with him. He also has to pick up
 one more key instead of using a Lockpick. Chris also has a
 partner with Rebecca, if that's good or bad is your call, but
 she is useful for giving you healing items when you need them.
 At one or two stages you may be required to play as Rebecca to
 do various tasks (getting serum or mixing chemicals).

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil 2 Dual Shock
            Chris appears in the Extreme Battle Mode as a bonus
            character which you need to unlock.
       -  Resident Evil Code Veronica
            Chris is the male lead you play as later in the
            game.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.4    | Jill Valentine
 -----    | Age: 23
          | Height: 5 ft 5 in (166 cm)
          | Weight: 111 lbs. (50.4 kg)
          | Blood Type: B
          | Assignment: Machine Expert

 An intelligent soldier that has saved many S.T.A.R.S. members
 from danger in the past, Jill has been reassigned to Raccoon
 City just like Chris. She is excellent with special
 mechanical devices such as lock picks. Jill has strong moral
 convictions and fights for what she believes in. While she has
 a great capacity for holding items, her small vitality puts
 her at a disadvantage.

 Jill is probably most people's first choice as their character
 in Resident Evil. Her easier mission, larger item carrying
 ability and more powerful weapon selections make the game very
 good for Resident Evil beginners. Jill seems to be a little
 unaware to things going on around her at times during Resident
 Evil, even though she is supposed to be intelligent, well
 according to the info from Capcom anyway.

 Arguments are caused about her past. From her return in
 Resident Evil 3, we learn she is ex-delta force (something
 which makes no sense by her age-yet again this is Capcom's
 info for you), but according to the book, for which some
 people cling to too much like a holy Resident Evil bible or
 something, it seems Jill used to be a thief because of her
 father, the job that made her "the master of lock picking."

 How Jill ended up as a STARS member is still unknown. If we
 were to go and follow the SD Perry novels path, it would seem
 her jailbird father told he to get out of the family business
 and join the other side of the law. Either way, and yet again
 against Capcom's info where she has quit in RE3 due the
 problems of being a STARS member, it seems she is proud of her
 accomplishments and being part of the STARS unit regardless of
 the problems happening within Resident Evil.

 Jill's weapon assortment is powerful. Bazooka (with 3 types of
 ammo), Shotgun, Magnum, Beretta, and of course the standard
 combat knife. Details on each of the weapons that Jill uses
 can be found in the Resident Evil weapons section here.

 Jill holds more items than Chris (8 instead of Chris' 6) and
 this makes the game easier as you'll have to do less item
 juggling and combining. She also has a lockpick which gives
 you access to doors and draws that Chris will have to use keys
 with. Barry will also give you the occasional piece of ammo,
 but unlike Chris with Rebecca, you will never get the chance
 to play as him.

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
            Jill takes the main role in Resident Evil 3.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.5    | Brad Vickers
 -----    | Age: 35
          | Height: 5 ft 9 in (174 cm)
          | Weight: 134 lbs. (60.8 kg)
          | Blood Type: O
          | Assignment: Pilot

 Brad is a computer expert and excels in information gathering.
 Unfortunately, his fear of dying draws much heat from his
 fellow soldiers.  His lack of enthusiasm for rushing into
 danger has earned him the nickname "Chickenheart." While Chris
 is a qualified pilot, Brad has become the helicopter pilot for
 Alpha Team.

 You never see actually Brad in the game, you only ever hear
 him a few times. Of course everyone believes he is worthy of
 dying seeing as he is the cause of why the Alpha Team is stuck
 where they are.

 Flying off in the teams helicopter, having no luck finding the
 mansion close by, then finding them and waiting until the
 mansion's about to blow up before chucking the Rocket
 Launcher. Others believe he's the most realistic character in
 the series, fleeing in the face of danger.

 Brad has later returned in both Resident Evil 2 and Resident
 Evil 3, making him the character to appear in the most number
 of games. Well perhaps that is if you count him for this game.

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil 2
            Brad is a Hidden Zombie who holds the special
            locker key. To see him you need to make it to the
            Police Station without picking up any items then
            go under the stair area. He's tough, taking up to
            30 bullets.
       - Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
            Brad has a minor staring role until Nemesis puts an
            end to is.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.6    | Albert Wesker
 -----    | Age: 38
          | Height: 6 ft (183 cm)
          | Weight: 186 lbs. (84.5 kg)
          | Blood Type: O
          | Assignment: Mission Leader

 Wesker has risen quickly inside the S.T.A.R.S. organization
 and currently leads the Alpha Team.  Viewed by many as a "cool
 guy," from his snappy haircut to his perpetual shades, Wesker
 was recruited by a headhunter for his sharp insight and
 eventually founded the S.T.A.R.S. unit in Raccoon City.

 What can I say about Wesker? Well not much or else I'll be
 talking about the depth of the game again (a problem I have if
 you've read any of the other characters bios I've written up
 :-D). Regardless, Wesker is certainly a favorite character of
 all the Resident Evil games to a lot of people, so much that
 it's lead me to believe it's the reason why Capcom decided to
 bring him back for Code Veronica. Though you really need to
 play both Resident Evil and Code Veronica to really see why
 that is confusing so many people right now. Wesker is the
 quiet captain of the Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. and the leader of
 the Alpha Team. You won't see him often, but when you do you
 will be sent on another mission to figure out what is going on
 in the mansion.

 While that might not sound correct for a team leader, it's
 what he does. Wesker just pops up when the moment is right, at
 various points through the game. He takes on his role as the
 leader of the S.T.A.R.S. by telling you what your mission
 objectives are. It seems odd though that while he tells you to
 do some things he doesn't follow it himself. One such example
 of this problem is him telling you to save ammo and supplies
 while he's sitting there shooting BEES for no real reason.
 Though this was changed in the Directors Cut version to
 spiders, which makes a bit more sense.

 Wesker, as I mentioned before, shows up in Code Veronica. With
 the release of Code Veronica complete to Dreamcast and
 PlayStation 2, they are hoping to add more info on his return
 and his background while adding more action to the game.
 Wesker has also been shown and/or mentioned in just about
 every Resident Evil game to date, and I doubt that's a thing
 which will change anytime soon.

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil Code Veronica
            Wesker returns in a main staring role.

 ==============================================================

 // Bravo Team

 2.3.7    | Richard Aiken
 -----    | Age: 23
          | Height: 5 ft 8 in (172 cm)
          | Weight: 138 lbs. (62.5 kg)
          | Blood Type: AB
          | Assignment: Communications

 A very important member of S.T.A.R.S. serving as Bravo's
 communications expert.  The only link back to headquarters for
 teams out in the field, Richard actually has to pull double
 duty as radioman for both units since Alpha Team really has no
 trained operator, except for Jill (who has a knack for
 technology). A very positive person, Richard greets new
 members warmly.

 Richard comes across as being very helpful, but this doesn't
 help due to the fact that he is suffering from wounds from
 being bitten by a "large...snake...also...poisonous..." Yes,
 he's just lying there on the floor, spluttering out words of
 monsters in his terrible death acting. You might have to be
 prepared to try and get him some serum too. In the end though
 he does give you some ammo, and perhaps a Com. Radio, so it
 can't all be so bad then.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.8    | Rebecca Chambers
 -----    | Age: 18
          | Height: 5 ft 3 in (161 cm)
          | Weight: 93 lbs. (42.1 kg)
          | Blood Type: AB
          | Assignment: Medical Personnel

 The youngest member of the group, Rebecca has been recruited
 for her knowledge of field medicine and First Aid. She is
 nervous around other members, both because of her age and due
 to her lack of experience.  Rebecca is eager to please and
 will take on any task assigned to her without hesitation.

 What can I write about Rebecca Chambers. Well lets start at
 her loud attitude. Now if I were to go with the Capcom info
 (above) then I would assume the loud attitude is her
 enthusiasm for her work, the "eager to please" part of the
 info up above. I do have to say that Rebecca does come in
 handy during Chris game very often, actually probably too many
 times, is what I really tell you. Of course, yes as most would
 say, she's really annoying at times and so that's the down
 point of having her there so often during the game. A good
 example of all this would be the piano part, but without going
 into details, you need to see the scene, if you tell her not
 to it becomes this little fight between her and Chris.

 Overall most people enact their revenge on Rebecca's attitude
 by letting a hunter kill her off when they get the chance (and
 there are a few ways of doing this too). Of course by doing
 that you can't go and get the best ending possible in Chris'
 game of Resident Evil, you need Rebecca alive to do that.

 During the game Rebecca will heal Chris, help him solve
 puzzles, make chemical mixes, get him items, and perhaps even
 save his life a couple of times. You will play as Rebecca in
 perhaps one or even a couple of situations throughout Chris'
 game (though it's nothing too hard for the sake of making
 Rebecca look... well I'm not sure). During this time you will
 see she is only armed with a Beretta with a measly 15 bullets
 and a first aid spray. It's obvious she's not made for
 fighting.

 Rebecca also turns up during Chris' game, like Barry does in
 Jill's game, to help along the story a bit. I'm not sure if
 that's exactly right to say if it is more story over help, as
 you may have noticed from the list above she does end up
 helping Chris a lot. However against what a lot of people say,
 I think Rebecca isn't one of the worse characters in the
 series, nor one of the best mind you. I will say for certain
 had Chris had no supporting character like Rebecca his game
 may have been a heck of a lot tougher to play.

 Rebecca has been mentioned a couple of times during Resident
 Evil 2. She also has a file in the Nintendo 64 version of the
 game and her photo turns up in just about every version of
 Resident Evil 2 also. She is also set to be the main character
 of Resident Evil Zero, a game set before Resident Evil. How
 this is to be pulled off is still yet to be revealed, but I
 have my theories. :)

     Appearances in other RE Games:
       - Resident Evil Zero
            Rebecca has the staring role in the yet to be
            released, Resident Evil Zero.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.9    | Enrico Marini
 -----    | Age: 41
          | Height: 6 ft 3 in (190 cm)
          | Weight: 183 lbs. (83 kg)
          | Blood Type: O
          | Assignment: Mission Leader

 Bravo Team's leader, and Wesker's second in command for the
 S.T.A.R.S. unit. Enrico feels threatened by the arrival of the
 Alpha Team, thinking that Chris or Barry may end up replacing
 him as #2 to Wesker.  Nonetheless, Enrico is a dedicated
 S.T.A.R.S. operative and is always proud to lead the unit when
 Wesker lets him.

 Enrico is the second in command an seems to know a lot, there
 is even a chance he was in on the background story of the
 game, though perhaps we shall never find out about that.
 Enrico seems cool enough but he doesn't sound like he trusts
 Chris. I would believe it may have something to do with
 Chris' high chances of replacing Enrico as 2nd in command.
 Oddly enough he doesn't act like this towards Barry who you
 would think would actually be the next in line to be 2nd in
 command. Weird.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.10   | Forest Speyer
 ------   | Age: 29
          | Height: 6 ft (183 cm)
          | Weight: 157 lbs. (71.1 kg)
          | Blood Type: A
          | Assignment: Vehicle Specialist

 Forest is a great sniper in addition to his duties as Bravo's
 vehicle specialist. He is a consummate professional, and his
 work earns him great respect from the other members. He
 instantly clicks with Chris, and it seems they'll end up good
 teammates.

 Forest was a likable fellow until he was attacked by one of
 RE's many creatures and went to hide on an outside porch, in
 which he was attacked again by crows and killed. In Resident
 Evil: Directors Cut he comes back to life as a zombie and we
 have to put him down again with whatever weapons we have.
 Forest suffers a terrible fate either way. Poor old Forest. It
 was really too bad no one was around to yell "Run Forest!
 Run!" when the crows attacked. I'm really sorry, I just had to
 use that horrid joke somehow.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.11   | Kenneth J. Sullivan
 ------   | Age: 45
          | Height: 6 ft 2 in (188 cm)
          | Weight: 213 lbs. (96.5kg)
          | Blood Type: O
          | Assignment: Field Scout

 A quiet but very talented field scouting officer.  Also is an
 expert in chemistry. He wonders why his chemical experience
 would be necessary in Raccoon City but quickly discounts his
 hesitancy since Wesker himself sought him to enlist in
 S.T.A.R.S.

 In Resident Evil, all we see of Kenneth is his legs have he's
 been killed. Nothing more than that. But in Biohazard (or any
 other version of the game with uncut movies) we get to see his
 face, though half eaten. From a standpoint on the plot behind
 the game, I can only assume that Kenneth's great skills in
 chemistry probably would have been of good use if he had not
 died.

 ==============================================================

 2.3.12   | Edward Dewey
 ------   | Age: 26
          | Height: 6 ft 3 in (193 cm)
          | Weight: 247 lb (112.1kg)
          | Blood Type: A
          | Assignment: Pilot

 Nothing. The Instructions had nothing but his name mentioned
 in the TOP SECRET mission briefing.

 As for me, I dunno, I get asked by people all the time who he
 is. You supposedly only see his hand in the opening of the
 game, if that is his hand, and that's that.

 Thanks to Satine for providing Dewey's stats from her
 Official Biohazard guidebook. :)

 2.4 - Monsters

 Here's a guide to all the beasties of Resident Evil.

 2.4.1.   | Zombies

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: 7-9 strikes
          | Handgun: 3-10 bullets (Except for REDC Headshot)
          | Shotgun: 1-3 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1 round

 Your typical zombie comes in an all familiar fashion if your
 used to "Romero Zombies" as these guys are based upon. Rotting
 members of the location your in; covered in tattered clothing,
 blood smeared, and perhaps missing body parts. They relive to
 eat your live warm flesh and other bodily parts. Simply put,
 Resident Evil wouldn't be Resident Evil without these un-dead
 foes.

 The zombies in Resident Evil are the various workers of the
 mansion and grounds, from maintenance staff to various
 researchers and technicians. Out of the whole series the
 Resident Evil zombies are probably the toughest versions out
 there, even though their attacks are limited and speed is very
 slow. The Directors Cut editions of the zombie family
 especially are tough, causing large amounts of damage,
 sometimes just with only a single bite.

 // Attacks

 Bites
 -----

 Your normal zombie attack are bites to your characters neck.
 Getting too close to a zombie will allow them to latch on and
 start nibbling away. If a zombie does do this then your best
 chance to get rid of them is to bash the action and
 directional buttons.

 Leg Bites
 ---------

 Coming close to a downed zombie will usually result in them
 grabbing onto your leg and taking a bite. To get rid of them,
 you should bash the buttons in a normal fashion till your
 character takes steps to killing the zombie, either by
 crushing or kicking its head.

 Vomit
 -----

 On those rare occasions when Zombies feel the need to chunder
 instead of feed you may feel the results. Basically when ever
 a zombie decides to throw it's acidic bile over you, try to
 step back to avoid it from hitting you.

 // Fighting Tactics

 Distant
 -------

 For distant shots against zombies you don't need anything more
 than your handgun for which you can pick off zombies as they
 slowly walk towards you. Their speed will allow you to do this
 with ease. Just make sure to target the closest zombie if
 there is many and to try and get more space if they are
 getting too close to you.

 Close Range
 -----------

 If you have the shotgun equipped then zombies will give you no
 problems at close range. By holding the shotgun up high until
 the zombie comes into range and the firing it, you will take
 their head clean off their shoulders. A nice one hit kill
 skill that every Resident Evil player must learn.

 Other
 -----

 If the zombie is on the floor then a shot or two with any
 weapon should kill them. For any zombie the handgun and
 shotgun should be all you need to take them out. Using other
 weapons on the zombies is only a waste of ammo.

 2.4.2.   | Cerberus (Dogs)

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: 9-10 strikes
          | Handgun: 3-10 bullets
          | Shotgun: 1-5 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1-2 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1-2 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1-2 rounds
          | Magnum: 1-3 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 When the T-Virus attacks the mansion's security dogs, this is
 the result you will get. A rotting zombie dog which wants more
 than the postman's leg, I can tell you that well from
 experience. The hell hounds themselves pose little threat
 compared to most enemies, but they usually appear in small
 packs of 2 to 3 whenever you encounter them.

 Their attacks are very limited and their very predictable to
 take down, especially with the handgun. The shotgun being used
 as a normal weapon seems to take more shots to take them out
 and so if you use it then you'll probably be wasting ammo
 doing so. Most of the time in Resident Evil you will find them
 walking around pointlessly in outdoor areas, though they are
 known to be able to pull out the shock effect during the game
 and then turn up in places you don't expect them to be found
 in.

 // Attacks

 Jumping Bite
 ------------

 The main things the dogs do is run up towards you and do a
 jumping bite. While these are predictable because they are the
 only attack they do and can be seen coming a mile away, if
 their about to jump there is little you can do to avoid it. If
 your about dead and a dog jumps to bite you they'll knock your
 character down and lock their jaws around your neck.

 Confusion
 ---------

 While this isn't really an attack, I thought I better add this
 info for Resident Evil players. The Cerberus have a tendency
 to run in circles either before or after making an attack,
 making it very hard to lock on to them (except for Directors
 Cut which has Auto Aim). Simply I can't give any hints to this
 as all you need to do is re-aim quick enough, and only you can
 do that. :)

 // Tactics

 Distance
 --------

 For distant shots against the Cerberus you don't need anything
 more than your handgun. As they run towards them fire a shot
 to knock them back. Continue to repeat this until you hear
 them yelp and die.

 Close Range
 -----------

 Using the handgun again can be great at close range. By coming
 close to a downed dog and shooting downwards at it each time
 it tries to stand back up you will be able to kill it with no
 problems. This works even better if you can corner it like
 shown in the picture to the left. This however is difficult if
 there is more than one dog around to kill as you'll probably
 be attacked from behind also. If this happens you should use a
 distant stance and pick them off as mentioned above.

 Close Range w/Shotgun
 ---------------------

 Using the shotgun while the dogs are in the air will knock
 them down and should kill them in one shot. The problem with
 this tactic is that there can be some trouble with the timing
 and the games collision detection. Still its a good thing to
 know if your low on ammo.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.3.   | Hunters

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 6-24 bullets
          | Shotgun: 3-5 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1-3 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1-3 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1-3 rounds
          | Magnum: 1-4 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 Large green monsters with claws... could they be frog, lizard
 or anything else? I'm not so sure myself, but I will say this,
 they are a bunch of tough buggers to beat. Watch out for their
 head swipe is the first thing I say to any RE newbie. They are
 a tough bunch to beat by any standards. Truly, while later
 editions could give you little to no problems, the Hunters of
 Resident Evil have to be one of the most difficult general
 enemies of the entire Resident Evil series thus far.

 From what it seems these Bio Organic Weapons were supposedly
 created by some accident (at least what the Survivor files
 lead us to believe) but used, enhanced, and later perfected
 (perhaps) by Umbrella Inc. for the use of maximum security in
 the mansion and mansion grounds (if this is correct where they
 were kept is never shown in the game).

 // Attacks

 Claw
 ----

 The hunters main attack is using their sharp claws to slice at
 your character. Most of the time this can't be avoided too
 well, but usually can be prevented by taking down the hunter
 quick enough.

 Jumping Slash
 -------------

 If there is something that will annoy you about the hunters
 more than anything it's their jumping attacks. Right when your
 setting up a shot the will jump and run into to slash at you.
 Hopefully there is enough space between you and where they
 land to get off a shot and drop them. On occasions they will
 jump over you. You should use this to your advantage.

 Head Swipe
 ----------

 If your low on health this attack may happen. This shot was
 very hard to get too mind you :) If this happens to you, then
 your dead. That's all there is to it.

 // Tactics

 Distant
 -------

 As long as their back isn't turned (hitting them in the back
 does little to no damage) the shooting them at a distance is
 recommended for battling the Hunters. If you don't have the
 Colt Python yet the best weapon to use is the Shotgun which
 will take out the hunters in 4-8 shots or with the bazooka
 which will take a small number of hits depending on what type
 of rounds your using, Acid Rounds are usually best.

 Close Range
 -----------

 In close range you should be using the same weapons and trying
 to knock the Hunters back so they can't swipe at you often if
 at all. The simple tactic is to take them out as quickly as
 you possibly can.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.4.   | Bees

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: 1 strike
          | Handgun: 1-3 bullets
          | Shotgun: 1 shell
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1 round
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1 round
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1 round
          | Magnum: 1-2 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 *pop* - *pop*. What's that sound? It's me wasting ammo on
 these bees is what it is. Oversized because of the outbreak
 in the mansion, these bees come at your in an infinite
 number, making your run fast or waste some ammo.

 Seriously though, besides the fact that they can poison you,
 you shouldn't waste your time bothering about these guys and
 you should just leave the one area they are found in.

 // Attacks

 Sting
 -----

 The bees will come close to you and sting you. Occasionally
 also they will latch on to your character until they throw
 them onto the ground. As mentioned above, on occasions their
 sting can poison you.

 // Tactics

 Pre-Tactics
 -----------

 This is simply, as mentioned above, the action where your
 character grabs the bee and throws it to the ground.

 Shooting
 --------

 If you want some target practice and have some ammo to spare,
 sure have a go. Though I think your wasting your time.

 Running
 -------

 This is what I advise you to do when you see them coming. It's
 not worth standing around shooting or allowing yourself to be
 stung.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.5.   | Crows

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: 1-2 strikes
          | Handgun: 1-2 bullets
          | Shotgun: 1 shell
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1 round
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1 round
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1 round
          | Magnum: 1 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 Beady eyes, sharp claws, sharp beaks, and very much crazy.
 Heck that shrill cry should send a tingle up anyone's spine. I
 still remember the first time I heard the crows while I
 stumbled around the mansion... something I can't forget even
 now.

 Always found in a small flock, these birds can cause a lot of
 damage in a little amount of time. Most of the time that you
 will find them in the game however it takes something to spook
 them before they attack so be careful with what you do when
 you hear or see them around. You might just trigger an attack.

 // Attacks

 Clawing and Pecking
 -------------------

 The standard attacks of the crows are just as this, clawing
 and pecking at you. You should button bash to get out of the
 lock then run. It's the best way to escape getting trapped in
 the same position again. Their other attack is what I call the
 dive-bomb. It is where the crows sit on the ground and the
 come swooping in to make a flying pass but don't actually
 attack. You can use this to your advantage in someway because
 it allows you to shoot them out of the air if you see it
 coming. However seeing as a dive-bomb sometimes becomes an
 attack the best way to avoid it is just to run out of the way.
 They will miss if you move at the right time.

 // Tactics

 Shooting
 --------

 Shooting them with just about any weapon works well, but I'd
 say using anything above the Handgun is wasting ammo. You can
 knife them easily also when they do their "dive bomb" attack,
 so this could also be another option if you do have your
 knife.

 Running
 -------

 When in doubt sprint for the exit. Most of the time this is
 the best thing to do if you have a large group of crows
 chasing after you. It saves you health and ammo.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.6.   | Spiders

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 5-18 bullets
          | Shotgun: 2-7 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1-3 round
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1-4 round
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1-3 round
          | Magnum: 1-3 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 Spiders (sometimes referred to as "Web Spinners") never really
 caused much problems as far as I remembered approaching the
 game for the 100th time or so... still their poison did a tad
 bit of damage to me, and then there was the black tiger.
 Whooboy.

 While some people I know hate spiders and basically will
 either kill everyone in the game they meet or run away, I tend
 to go for the latter and just run through any areas that they
 populate.

 There are 3 types of spiders in the game, one large boss
 (which has it's own section), your standard ingame ones, and
 smaller spiders which run around doing nothing but jumping up
 and biting you or allowing you to stand all over them, killing
 them. All are rather easy to kill and for the most part can
 also be avoided too if you wish them to be.

 // Attacks

 Acid
 ----

 The easy to avoid acid spit is the Spiders main attack. Once
 you see it coming (the spiders sit still to do it) you can
 avoid it easily by moving out of range. If you wish to fight
 them this time where they sit still can also be used as an
 advantage to fire off a shot or two, as long as you do have
 some distance between yourself and the spider so as you don't
 get hit by the acid in the process.

 Body Blow
 ---------

 If you get in the path of a moving spider occasionally they'll
 smack into you with their bodies, causing your character to
 make a sound and be hit back a little. If this does any damage
 I'm not sure, it probably does but regardless it can leave
 you open to be hit by Acid or another spider if your not that
 lucky.

 Jumping Bite
 ------------

 The small spiders, which do basically no damage anyway,
 perform this attack where they will jump up at your legs and
 take a bite. More of an annoyance than a problem.

 // Tactics

 Shooting
 --------

 Spiders are quite easy to take out at a distance. Just about
 any weapon is good against them as they can be affected by
 standard bullets, along with the affects of the 3 types of
 Bazooka rounds. The problems you can face is the spiders
 walking on the roof, though usually when you get close to them
 or fire off a shot they will drop from the roof anyway.

 Running
 -------

 This is what I choose to do in most cases, basically avoiding
 the enemy. Spiders are slow and easy to avoid, so running
 through areas they are located in is very easy to do,
 especially if they are on the roof. Especially for killing any
 spiders, running and leaving the room will get rid of any
 small spiders scrambling about when you come back in.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.7.  | Chimera

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 5-30 bullets
          | Shotgun: 2-7 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 1-6 round
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 1-6 round
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 1-6 round
          | Magnum: 1-4 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 These guys puzzled me. I sat there thinking about what kind of
 creatures they really seemed to be. I wish I hadn't because
 before long I had one clinging to Jill's back and slashing at
 her throat. Still now I have no clue what exactly these things
 originally were, but it's probably better that I don't think
 about it while playing the game like last time or else I might
 end up being killed again.

 Found in the lab sections nearer the end of the game, these
 odd roof scuttling creatures love to do no more than slice at
 you with their sickle clawed arm. Their easy to avoid if you
 keep running through sections you find them in, they are
 basically hard to take out with just about everything except
 for the Colt Python, and they are a real pest if you can't
 handle them correctly even with it.

 // Attacks

 Hanging Swipes
 --------------

 An attack where the Chimera's hang upside down to the ceiling
 and drop their arms down to attack. The attack also has a wide
 range. This is easy to avoid if you see it coming, though if
 their right above you then chances are you won't be able to do
 much about it. After it happens move quickly.

 Uppercut
 --------

 If you get caught in this I advise you to check your health
 because it does a serious amount of damage. This one is a
 little harder to see coming because they can sometimes fake
 you out. The uppercut starts when they run up to you but on
 occasions they just jump to the roof and do a hanging swipe.
 I'm not sure of any real evasive tactics, just watch out and
 try to run to avoid.

 Throat Slash
 ------------

 Another high damage move. This time the chimera will jump on
 your back stopping you from moving and will slash your throat
 with it's claw. This doesn't happen so often, but when it does
 there is really nothing you can do for stopping it.

 // Tactics

 Shooting
 --------

 My choice is not to fight these guys as much as I can, however
 if you have to use anything to take them out it should be the
 Colt Python. It will stop you from having to waste your time
 while killing them. You have to keep in mind it may take at
 least 2 shots if not more to take them out while they jump
 around and all.

 Running
 -------

 Simple. Run. Run fast. Move quickly and know the layout well.
 Do what you need and do it quickly. :)

 ==============================================================

 2.4.8.   | Yawn (Large Snake)

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: ??? bullets
          | Shotgun: 8-10 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 3-8 round
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 3-8 round
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 3-8 round
          | Magnum: 5-12 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 If there was ever a creature to scare me, it would be snakes.
 I don't think I ever want to touch one, let alone come close
 to one, and meeting the "Yawn" in Resident Evil made me ever
 so much sure of that point.

 Okay, well I better be honest here actually... I'm not
 actually afraid of snakes, I just needed to write a good intro
 like this. :)

 You will meet this snake twice during the game, the first time
 it will block you from a goal and the second time it will open
 a path way for you. During the first battle you can be
 poisoned from it's bite(s) in which you may get help or have
 to get serum for yourself. You cal also take various tactics
 with the monster. The second battle is "to the death" so to
 speak. You'll just have to make sure that you have enough fire
 power to stop it. In both encounters I advise you have saved
 before fighting it.

 // Attacks

 Bite
 ----

 The "Yawn's" only real attack. Attacks from the oversized
 snake are single bites to the legs of your character as it
 passes by you. You should also know that if it stands up to
 attack that you should quickly check your health, as it only
 does this when your on danger.

 // Tactics

 First Encounter - Shooting
 --------------------------

 Acid Rounds. Simply if your going to fight as Jill you need to
 be using these. Capcom were nice enough to leave some in a
 room near to where the large snake is, but you need the
 lighter to see where they are.

 For Chris you have no choice but to use the Shotgun. There are
 some extra shells in the attic room you will battle the snake
 with also if you need some more ammo.

 First Encounter - Running
 -------------------------

 What you need to do, is try to trick the large snake in to
 coming around things away from you. You can first do this as
 soon as you have control of your character again. Just stand
 there until the snake moves around the back of the pole. You
 have to be quick. Usually you will end up getting bitten once
 or twice (even worse if you get trapped), but it is
 occasionally possible to make it without being hit at all.

 Second Encounter - Shooting all the Way
 ---------------------------------------

 Again, Acid Rounds and Shotgun Shells are the method here. If
 you've taken all the time to get the Colt Python first by all
 means feel free to use it. Having a First Aid Spray or some
 mixed herbs on you won't hurt either seeing as your going to
 need to make your way through many enemies on the section open
 to you after the battle.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.9.   | Neptune (Large Shark)

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: ??? bullets
          | Shotgun: ??? shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: ??? rounds
          | Bazooka w/Acid: ??? rounds
          | Bazooka w/Flame: ??? rounds
          | Magnum: ??? bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: ??? rockets

 Don't you just love instant deaths? What, you don't? Heck you
 better watch out when the Neptune comes swimming your way. It
 can swim fast, it can leap distances, it can fly high... well,
 not really the last one so as much. But I did see it leap out
 of the water and latch it's jaws around my characters head. I
 wonder if there was anyone out there stupid enough to try path
 and get that scene more than once. If there is I pity them for
 it.

 There are some simply solutions to getting around the
 Neptune(s). When you get into a large watery area pick the
 path on the characters right, and when you get the FMV of the
 Neptune around make sure you run as fast as you can through
 the water. Later on you will get a type of revenge by leaving
 the Neptune's high and dry. You can even shoot them if you
 have the ammo to waste, though it's not really needed.

 // Attacks

 Bite
 ----

 Taking a bite at your legs and pulling you around a bit is
 basically the Neptune's only attack. If your low on health
 though you will suffer a fate worse than a small nibble to the
 legs. To avoid this you'll need to run.

 Swallow
 -------

 If you pick the wrong direction when confronting the area they
 are found, or your low on health when near to the Neptune's,
 you will be instantly killed by the largest Neptune. It jumps
 out of the water and takes you down.

 // Tactics

 Running
 -------

 When picking the right direction to take you will have to run
 to the correct door (shown here) and use the key. You'll be a
 little slowed down by the water but should be able to make it
 inside before the Neptune gets too close to you.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.10.  | Black Tiger (Large Spider)

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 10-20 bullets
          | Shotgun: 7=12 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 5-10 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 5-10 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 5-10 rounds
          | Magnum: 5-7 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket

 In the underground is the king of all spiders, three times as
 large, three times as powerful, requiring three times the ammo
 to kill. This large spider, refereed to in most official
 guides as the "Black Tiger" isn't as hard to kill as you'd
 think, as long as you have a powerful weapon (which at this
 point in the game-you will have).

 It's attacks are very limited meaning you have easy chances to
 kill it, but don't get too cocky as if you're hit by it a few
 times you'll be set to become part of the webbing on the
 walls.

 // Attacks

 Acid
 ----

 The only real attack the Tiger does is an acid spit, which is
 just like the normal spiders except there is three times the
 amount. Occasionally it will also do the body blow if it gets
 close, but if your shooting it, it usually just moves left and
 right, not closer to you.

 // Tactics

 Shooting
 --------

 The best way to take this guy out is to move around it
 shooting it at it's side as best you can with the bazooka or
 magnum. Considering it also likes to move to a better position
 before attacking you should be able to take it out with no, or
 little damage this way.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.11.  | Plant 42

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 25+ bullets
          | Shotgun: 10-18 shells
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 5-10 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 5-10 rounds
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 5-10 rounds
          | Magnum: 8-15 bullets
          | Rocket Launcher: ???

 I remember first reading the files about Plant-42 in the game,
 swearing the hopes to never to have to battle this thing, that
 somehow it was going to be missed out on. Too bad Capcom
 didn't feel like giving me a break for once. I remember
 finding the first couple of times playing RE that Plant 42 was
 very tough. This was mostly caused because of the fact you
 would need to move every once and a while and then reset your
 aim on the plant.

 The Directors Cut edition made this problem go away with the
 auto aiming. Simply running to a new location and pressing R1
 would let you reset your aim on the plant, making it much more
 simple. Of course there is another way around the plant, that
 is if you want to be making your way into a chemical store
 room to mix up a little bit of the V-Jolt and get rid of the
 plant easier with this chemical mixture.

 // Attacks

 Vine Whip
 ---------

 Coming too close to the plant will let it hit you with it's
 vines. You'll be knocked forward and your character will fall
 to the ground. This can occasionally leave you open for
 another hit also. To avoid being hit by the plants vines all
 you need to do is stick close to the walls.

 Acidic Roof Drop
 ----------------

 I had no idea what else to call this. Simply, as you stand
 targeting the plant, bits of the roof will fall down. Your
 indication is little drops falling before a large chunk will
 drop, and if your character is underneath it, it will cause
 damage to them. To avoid this keep an eye on the drops of bits
 of the roof. Before the large bit drops run forward a few
 steps to avoid being hit.

 // Tactics

 Shooting
 --------

 Jill - Bazooka. Flame rounds are good. So are acid.

 Chris - Trusty old shotgun will do the trick.

 Run around the walls taking potshots at the plant until you
 get a cut scene. Be careful of it's attacks and you'll be
 fine. A green herb or two might be needed if you think you'll
 get hit. As mentioned above this is easier to do in the
 Directors Cut edition, where the auto aim will allow you to
 target the plant easily.

 V-Jolt Mixture
 --------------

 Making the V-Jolt will allow you to kill the root in the
 basement, but it might not be enough and so you'll have to
 fight a weaker version of the plant also. The guide will tell
 you how to make the V-Jolt.

 ==============================================================

 2.4.12.  | Tyrant-002

          // Weapon Hit Guide

          | Knife: ?? strikes
          | Handgun: 10-25 bullets (1st Enc.)
          | Shotgun: 8-12 shells  (1st Enc.)
          | Bazooka w/Grenade: 5-8 rounds (1st Enc.)
          | Bazooka w/Acid: 5-8 rounds (1st Enc.)
          | Bazooka w/Flame: 5-8 rounds (1st Enc.)
          | Magnum: 3-10 bullets (1st Enc.)
          | Rocket Launcher: 1 rocket (Both Enc.)

 In the red corner, wearing no trunks, and a pulsating heart,
 the undisputed "Ultimate Biological Weapon", Tyrant Model 002.
 Well I'm not sure about the Ultimate Biological Weapon thing
 but that's what... ooh, I can't say that. It gives away a big
 point which some people may not know about. Regardless even
 with later models being much better, the Tyrant type is still
 known as the "Ultimate Biological Weapon."

 Anyway, in both times that it is possible to fight the Tyrant
 are fairly easy. The first requires little more than a few
 shots from the Colt Python and the second time you encounter
 the Tyrant is only really requiring some good controlling of
 your character to get around without being attacked. This
 second time encounter is dependent on what ending you are
 going to get as if it is a lower grade ending you won't face
 the Tyrant a second time in the game.

 // Attacks

 Claw
 ----

 A simple attack the Tyrant does as it is walking around. A
 single claw strike against your character. Does a small amount
 of damage depending on which version of the Tyrant your
 facing.

 Slash
 -----

 During the second battle the Tyrant will make a running slash
 at you. As shown in the screen this is easy to dodge by
 running away from the direction he is heading towards.

 Claw Smash
 ----------

 During the second battle with the Tyrant, should he pull out
 his larger claw and come running for you he can sometimes use
 it as a backhanded attack and smack you across an area of the
 heliport. This can be disorientating if you slide backwards
 over a couple of screen changes.

 Stab
 ----

 Again with the second battle, although it does happen a
 sometimes in the first, should you have enough health and the
 Tyrant is close instead of using the claw to hit you he will
 stab at you with it. It does a fair bit of damage though, so
 check your health and heal if you need it.

 Skewer
 ------

 If your on the end of this I can say your dead. In both
 battles should you be on danger and the Tyrant attacks, you
 will be impaled upon his claw. Not the greatest thing to
 happen.


 // Tactics

 1st Encounter
 -------------

 Colt Python, Colt Python, Colt Python. Before battling the
 first form of the Tyrant you need to have the Colt with about
 a full round (6 shots) of ammo. While he usually only takes 3
 shots, depending on the version and how the game feels it may
 take more than this. You should also have a back up weapon
 just in case. All you need to do is run and wait on one side
 of the room and shoot at him as he comes close. Repeat until
 he is dropped.

 Final Battle
 ------------

 Fill all but one slot with herbs. While you probably wont need
 more than one, if any at all, be prepared. You'll need the
 other single slot for items. All you need to do here on the
 heliport once you've lit the flare is run in circles avoiding
 the Tyrant, until the clock gets around or just under 30
 seconds. At this time Brad will drop the rocket launcher. Run
 in, grab it, line up your shot and fire. If you targeted well
 enough one shot will be all you need.

 2.5 - Weapons
 --------------

 Here is a list of weapons you'll get in Resident Evil. To
 equip a weapon, go into the inventory and click on a weapon.
 Simply click "Equip" and you'll have that weapon to use. To
 use the weapon hold the aim button and use the action button
 to fire. To target use the direction pad/keys to aim.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Knife
 Description: "This doesn't seem to be enough for this
               mission."
 Who gets it: Chris, Jill
 Ammo is: N/A
 Holds: N/A
 Best on: Crows attacking but nothing else.

 Known as the lowest form of self defense, the Combat Knife is
 usually something people chuck into the chest at the first
 chance they get. During Resident Evil though they do make use
 of the Knife through being used on some spider webs. Of course
 you find a second knife in the location it is needed for
 anyway, because you know, you won't be carrying this thing in
 your inventory at the time.

 If your good enough at Resident Evil and want a challenge I
 advise you to take on the knife challenge. It's sure to make
 that next game of Resident Evil all that much more exciting.

 Found: Jill : Check your inventory.

        Chris: Check your inventory.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Handgun - Beretta M92F
 Description: "Beretta M92FS Automatic loaded with 9mm
               bullets."
 Who gets it: Chris, Jill
 Ammo is: Handgun Bullets
 Holds: 15 bullets
 Best on: Zombies, Dogs.

 S.T.A.R.S. standard issue handgun. The Beretta will be your
 trusty weapon for most of the first part of Resident Evil. Of
 course for Chris you wont get it until about 5 minutes into
 the game. The handgun is at is best for long range combat,
 especially with slow enemies, such as zombies. Taking on
 Hunters with this weapon would be a foolish idea indeed.

 For the DC Version you can get a Custom Edition of the
 Beretta. It has a certain percentage where shooting zombies
 you maybe able to take off their heads like with the Colt
 Python. This gun is much needed for the Advanced/Arranged
 version of the game.

 The Beretta take Clips of 15 bullets. These are very common
 and can be found just about anywhere, usually sitting on
 objects around the mansion. You can carry a maximum of 250
 bullets in one slot, along with 15 in the gun.

 Found: Jill : Not much of a problem here, Jill will find her
             : gun in her starting inventory. Equip and start
             : firing.

        Chris: After returning to the main hall, Chris will
             : find it empty except for a weapon on the floor.
             : Jill's Beretta. You'll be able to take it to
             : use.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Shotgun - Remington M870
 Description: "Remington M870. A pump-action shotgun."
 Who gets it: Chris, Jill
 Ammo is: Shotgun Shells
 Holds: 7 Shells
 Best on: Dogs, Hunters (sometimes)

 Upon searching the mansion you should come across this
 excellent Zombie killing weapon. The Remington is an even
 better weapon when used aiming high at the zombies heads. It
 also has good use when dogs jumping at you, shooting them
 while they are in the air, you should be able to take them out
 with one shot also.

 The shotgun is not as good for use with Hunters as they
 usually take a few shots to go down, and within those few
 shots they get a good chance to swipe you a few times.

 To earn the shotgun, you may also need the broken shotgun, the
 location of this will be found in the items section as well as
 noted in the guide itself.

 The Shotgun takes seven shells found in crates. These are
 located at a few locations around the mansion, sometimes found
 in pairs. You can carry a maximum of 250 shells in one slot,
 along with 7 in the shotgun.

 Found: Jill &: The shotgun is hanging on a holder in the
        Chris : middle of the east wing of the mansions 1st
              : floor. However while Jill can take it right
              : away, Chris can't. This is because there is a
              : trap after you take it. Jill will be saved by
              : Barry if she takes it early, but otherwise
              : you'll need to take the broken shotgun and put
              : it on the holder after you take the shotgun to
              : disarm the trap. While Chris and Jill can find
              : the broken shotgun and use it. For Chris it is
              : the only way.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Colt Python
 Description: "Powerful gun can be loaded with .357 magnum
               rounds."
 Who gets it: Chris, Jill
 Ammo is: Magnum Rounds
 Holds: 6 Rounds
 Best on: Everything really.

 The Colt Python has gotta be one of the better weapons of the
 game. With it you can feel confident to take on most opponents
 with ease. The Colt can take the head off a zombie, kill a
 hunter in a shot or two, and even knock around a Tyrant with
 little problem. It's awesome firepower makes it a good weapon
 in your collection, but it's lack of ammo can hinder your use
 of it.

 Originally concepts have shown that it was planned that some
 of the ammo in the game would have been Dum Dum rounds but
 these were removed before the game went out.

 The Colt Python holds one full round of six bullets. Ammo is
 very rare until nearer the end of the game, so I suggest only
 using it when you really need it. With the Directors Cut
 edition, beating the advanced/arrange game in under 3 hours
 will give you the Colt Python with unlimited ammo.

 Found: Jill &: To get the Colt Python you'll need the Red
        Chris : Jewel. Once gained you can take it and use it
      Original: on the Tiger Statue in the the statue room on
              : the 1st floor of the mansion. Doing so will
              : gain you the Python.

        Jill &: In the Directors Cut edition you will find the
      Chris DC: magnum on the shelf where the Broken Shotgun
      Advanced: usually is found. The small room off the
              : Mansion west wings bottom stairwell. You will
              : need a key to enter the room.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Bazooka
 Description: "A launcher (that) can be loaded with various
               rounds."
 Who gets it: Jill
 Ammo is: Bazooka Rounds (Acid, Flame, and Explosive)
 Holds: 6 Rounds
 Best on: Snake, Hunters (Acid), Plant 42, Zombies, Dog
          (Flame), Everything and anything else :) (Explosive)

 The Bazooka is just as good as the Colt Python when you look
 at it, but only Jill can use this weapon in the game. The
 Bazooka uses 3 types of ammo which are color coded for ease.
 The three rounds are Explosive Rounds (in the grey container),
 Flame Rounds (in the red container), and Acid Rounds (in the
 yellow container).

 The Bazooka can be used against just about any enemy, and with
 the various ammo is very effective. The only let down with the
 Bazooka when compared to the Grenade Launchers of the later
 evils is that you have to use all 6 shots of the ammo before
 you can load a new lot of the same or another type.

 The Bazooka holds one full case (six shots) of one type of
 round. Ammo is common, though there are less of some types
 than others.

 Found: Jill : Jill's strongest weapon is found out on the 2nd
             : Floor terrace with Forest. However caution is
             : required regardless of the edition your playing.
             : Either Crows will attack if you look at the dead
             : Forest, or if your playing the Directors Cut,
             : he'll get up and attack you. Depending on your
             : choices or weapons (i.e. if you got the Shotgun
             : by Barry saving your ass), instead of finding
             : only Forest out here you will find Barry and he
             : will hand you the Bazooka.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Flame-thrower
 Description: "Can throw flame for 9 sec. with max. fuel."
 Who gets it: Chris
 Ammo is: Flame-thrower Fuel
 Holds: 250% Fuel
 Best on: Large Spider (Only Just)

 I really think the in-game description says it all. The
 Flamethrower really sucks and is mainly a waste of item space
 for Chris, and so it's only useful as part of a puzzle. You
 can find two of them, but you can only use them for a while as
 afterwards you need them to unlock doors to move farther on.

 Of course it's not much of a problem putting them down, seeing
 as they aren't that much of a good weapon anyway. The flame is
 mostly good for organic creatures such as spiders, and their
 webs. *hint-hint*

 The Flamethrower holds a small amount of fuel, which as
 mentioned, goes down quickly. There is supposed to be a refill
 (supposedly also some copies had a fuel refill in an area in
 the underground). The fuel item exists on all versions, though
 you may need to hack it out with a Gameshark or Save Game
 editor.

 Found: Chris: Found easily by an entry door you need to grab
             : this to make it past another door later on. The
             : lever it sits on locks that door and so you need
             : it to open that door with another one of these
             : panels.

 ==============================================================

 Weapon: Rocket Launcher
 Description: "One shot can destroy any target."
 Who gets it: Jill, Chris
 Ammo is: Rockets
 Holds: 4 (Or Unlimited as secret)
 Best on: Everything Slow (Anything but Hunters and the Snake)

 The king of weapons in Resident Evil. The Rocket Launcher is
 used in-game to rid yourself of the Tyrant in certain
 situations. You will have 4 shots to take the Tyrant out,
 though all you will need is one shot.

 If you finish the game in under 3 hours you can earn it for
 use in the game with Unlimited Ammo. This makes the game all
 that much more fun as you run through the game taking revenge
 by shooting everything in a shot or two.

 As I mentioned, this shows just how destructive the Rocket
 Launcher is, but the let down for this is that the Launcher
 can be slow to use due to the characters having to lift it to
 shoulder height before being able to fire. For this reason you
 shouldn't try to use it on anything which appears close to you
 or moves too fast to target well.

 Found: Jill &: If you've gotten yourself to the helicopter pad
        Chris : and you are being attacked by the Tyrant again
              : then you just need to avoid him and wait.
              : Depending on how quick you were to begin with
              : Brad will drop the Rocket Launcher in the
              : middle of the pad sometime when there is less
              : than 40 seconds left. You need to run in, grab
              : it, and kill the Tyrant. You can also get the
              : Rocket Launcher if you finish the game in under
              : 3 hours (PlayStation & Saturn editions only).
              : To know if you've got it, at the end of the
              : credits a rocket will go across the screen.

 ==============================================================

 Bonus Weapons
 -------------

 For the PC version 2 additional bonus weapons can be gained.
 The Ingram MAC-10 and the Minimi. Both of these are earned
 through completing the game in under 3 hours with Jill or
 Chris. Both use 9mm Ammo but are unlimited and fire rapidly,
 taking anything out with ease.

 ==============================================================

 -----------------------------
 2.6 - Playing Tips And Hints
 -----------------------------

 2.6.1 - Deciding On Playing As Chris Or Jill First
 --------------------------------------------------

 The first choice you have when you start the game is who you
 will play as first. It is for this reason that I have decided
 to help with this part by showing you info about the
 characters.


 Chris Redfield
 --------------

 Firstly, Chris has a lot more health, so this is the first
 thing for him that you should think about. Unfortunately, it's
 the only good thing about his mission. He has it tough indeed.
 Chris' stronger weapons are also low on ammo. He has a deal of
 shotgun shells, but there will be points where you will run
 low. Magnum bullets are in even less supply as you'd expect.

 Of a small point, you have to face the first zombie with no
 gun (I can only assume Chris' dropped his gun from between the
 time you see him shooting in the video and when they get in
 the hall) but you can run from that. Chris can also only carry
 six items at a time, which means you have to be good at
 juggling items around or be happy with making a lot of box
 stops.

 To open some locks will require a small key. There are many of
 these found in his game, and they usually open drawers to find
 ammo. You can get help from Rebecca at times, but this is very
 dependent of the situation. All of this adds up to make
 Chris' game an interesting, and challenging experience indeed.


 Jill Valentine
 --------------

 Jill's mission is somewhat easier than Chris' one. Firstly she
 has the Bazooka on top of the Shotgun and Magnum, thus adding
 more range to her actions, on top of that there is also a lot
 more ammo for her weapons.

 She has two more slots than Chris for carrying items, 8 slots
 makes item organization a lot easier than 6, even though it is
 only 2 slots difference.

 Instead of not having a gun at the start like Chris, she does
 and it can be used to kill the first enemy. Her game is also
 quicker as she gets help in places (Barry and the shotgun
 scene for example) quite a lot. Instead of the small keys
 Chris has, she gets a lockpick (also from Barry) which will
 open the things Chris' small keys will.

 The downside to using Jill is her health, it's very low. A few
 good attacks from zombies or other enemies can mean lights
 out. It is for this reason, that you should make sure you
 carry or have a good amount of health in storage.

 (For the PC version Jill has the added ease of being able to
  save unlimitedly with no ink ribbons - if you're playing the
  PC version think of this as an additional item slot saving
  ability)


 As for the conclusion of this, I would say for the first time
 you play you should use Jill to learn the ropes until you
 think you can take on Chris' mission, but the final choice is
 up to you if you pick Chris' or Jill's mission.


 2.6.2 - Herbal Mixing
 ---------------------

 Each herb has a different effect, but when mixed together the
 powers they possess are boosted in different results.

 The herb power-ups can be mixed using the "combine" command
 for varying, but very beneficial results. This will also save
 storage space for holding puzzle items. Here is a listing of
 some herbal combinations and the outcomes:

 1 green + 1 green         = 80% health recovery
 1 green + 1 blue          = 20% health recovery + antidote
 1 green + 1 red           = Full health recovery
 1 green + 1 red + 1 blue  = Cure (in that order)
 3 green combined          = Full health.


 2.6.3 - Rebecca Helps
 ---------------------

 When playing as Chris, anytime after you first meet Rebecca
 and before when you save her from the Hunter, return to the
 save room and she will heal you for nothing.


 2.6.4 - Listen For The Sounds Of The Undead
 -------------------------------------------

 Some enemies make noises, so it's important to listen out for
 them. You'll be able to hear most enemies long before you can
 see them. Also certain attacks have certain noises which may
 help you tell what is coming outside of your current screen.


 2.6.5 - Take Note Of Attack Patterns
 ------------------------------------

 Dogs require to be up on all four legs before you can shoot
 them, zombies can attack your legs etc. Make sure you stay
 away of what enemies can do, especially if you can't see them
 on your screen. Again here noise can help.


 2.6.6 - Aiming
 --------------

 Besides Resident Evil Directors Cut, aiming in the various
 versions of Resident Evil requires you to aim for your enemy.
 This is very difficult for some faster enemies (Hunters
 especially).

 Actually most of these notes on aiming your weapons to avoid
 being hit and wasting ammo.

 In Directors Cut, when you press R1, you will lock on to the
 closest enemy. But pressing L1 will allow you to lock onto
 other targets.

 For the original you need to take a general guess at an aimed
 shot and if you aren't careful can end up wasting ammo
 instead. The larger the target the easier job you'll have
 landing a shot, however try and make sure you are happy with
 your aim before you try.


 2.6.7 - Pool Of Blood
 ---------------------

 Enemies are dead (again) when a pool of blood spreads around a
 downed enemy. Also some enemies will make noises when killed,
 again these noises are also worth taking note of.


 2.6.8 - Shotgun Kills
 ---------------------

 Waiting for a zombie to come close make sure you have the
 shotgun drawn and pointing up, when it is about to grab you
 fire your gun and you should be able to blow the head of the
 zombie right off.

 You can do this easily in the Directors Cut version. Even with
 hunters when they jump. Just make sure your ready to shoot at
 the right time. This same jump technique also works with the
 cerberus.


 2.6.9 - Item Ordinance
 ----------------------

 Make sure you arrange your items wisely. You should only carry
 what you think you need. This also means you shouldn't pick up
 everything you find. There are many rooms with items you don't
 need, and should only pick up when you need them (herbs for
 health etc.). Just take note of where things are and return
 for them when you're in need.


 2.6.10 - Enemies
 ----------------

 You don't have to kill everything in your way. Basically you
 should only kill things in your way, or in locations where you
 will continue to move through frequently.

 They don't call this SURVIVAL horror for nothing.


 2.6.11 - RUN! RUN! RUN!
 -----------------------

 Basically anytime you aren't solving a puzzle or picking up an
 item you should have your finger firmly planted on the run
 button. Not only will this speed your time up, but it will
 also help you evade enemies and travel distances quicker.


 2.6.12 - Being Attacked
 -----------------------

 Should you be attacked by anything that will freeze your
 movement quickly tap control buttons to get out of the attack.
 This is important in certain situations, especially with large
 groups of the same enemy. Getting 2 hunters on you is
 extremely bad as they may start playing games of tennis with
 you, taking turns at swipes until you're dead.


 2.6.13 - Trap/Puzzle Notes
 --------------------------

 Should you spring a trap or screw up a puzzle, run for the
 exit of the room. Most chances this will finish the trap, or
 reset the puzzle it allowing you to get past it again. The
 only trap where this is not possible is the shotgun trap.


 2.6.14 - Directors Choice
 -------------------------

 With the Directors Cut versions you have the choice of
 Training, Original, and Advanced/Arranged.

 Original is the first version of Resident Evil and has a good
 mix of ammo, enemies, and difficulty.

 Training is the same as Original only giving you 2 times the
 ammo and taking the damage down to lower levels making it far
 easier.

 Advanced (Or Arrange if you're playing REDS) is the super
 difficulty level. Items have changed locations, enemies are in
 different places, and damage is high. Hunters can even head
 swipe you on near full health. Not for the newcomer of the
 series.

 You might want to choose wisely which mode you wish to take
 first.


 2.6.15 - Sega Saturn Changes
 ----------------------------

 While the Sega Saturn version is roughly similar there are a
 few changes made to the main game. These include:

 - New enemies

 In the underground are new skinned version of the Hunter.
 These bug-like Hunters are called "Tics" but remain unchanged
 strategy and attack wise from normal Hunters.

 - Second Tyrant

 In Chris' game or any of Jill's where Barry does not come into
 the Tyrant's B4 lab, there will be a second Tyrant to fight
 before you leave the lab. Let's hope you have enough ammo.

 - New costumes

 Both Chris and Jill have new Saturn only bonus costumes.


 2.6.16 - The Overlooked Inventory Use
 -------------------------------------

 - Weapon

 To equip a weapon, go into the inventory and click on a
 weapon. Simply click "Equip" and you'll have that weapon to
 use. To use the weapon hold the aim button and use the action
 button to fire. To target use the direction pad/keys to aim.

 - Item

 To use a item, stand in front of what you wish to use it for,
 go into the inventory and click on the item. Simply click
 "Use" and you'll have that item used. After using a key for
 all it is needed for, you will probably be asked if you wish
 to drop the key. Do so, as you won't need it for anything
 else. You can reload your gun by selecting it and combining
 the ammo at anytime, which will also help you not get hit
 while reloading your weapon.

 3.0 - Original & Advanced Walkthrough
 -------------------------------------

 Finally, we're here. This section covers an entire guide for
 both Chris and Jill in the original release of Resident Evil as
 well as "Original", "Training", and "Advanced"/"Arranged"
 modes of the Directors Cut edition.

 This will also get you through the Sega Saturn mode, keeping
 in mind the aforementioned changes (section 2.6.15 above).

 ==============================================================

 ------------------------
 3.1 - Chris' Walkthrough
 ------------------------

 Here is Chris' Walkthrough. This guide is to get the Good and
 Good+ Endings. To get the other two follow the instructions at
 end of the walkthrough.

 This is not a speed walkthrough; it's just so people can get
 the best out of Resident Evil. There are many rooms, which are
 not mentioned in this Walkthrough, these contain extra ammo,
 healing items, and files. Feel free to search these rooms at
 your choice and collect other items when required.

 Also there will be times where you will have to go to save
 rooms to put items away. When you do this is also up to you.

 Other than this, everything for the game is explained, so I'd
 advise use of this guide only if you are stuck on a certain
 area, wish to get through the game quickly, and don't care if
 puzzle answers are given to you exactly.

 Excuse my sometimes sarcastic titles for each section. I have
 no idea what I was thinking when I wrote them, but I liked
 most of them enough to keep them. :)

 If there is any thing important such as a movie of variation
 it will be marked like this:

 Well here is the walkthrough.


 -----------------------------
 3.1.1 - Welcome To Your Death
 -----------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Clips (x2)
 Ink Ribbon

 FMV Video:
 ----------
 Once you have selected Chris, you'll be shown a FMV of what
 happened to get the S.T.A.R.S. in this situation.

 Scene:
 ------
 After the movie style character intro, there will be a short
 intro. You'll hear a gun shot and Captain Wesker will send you
 to go find out what it is.

 Once you're in the dining room run down to the other end of
 the table. Go in the other door and go to Chris' left and
 around the corner.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 You hear a ripping of flesh and a pool of blood comes across
 the floor as a person looks over their shoulder, blood down
 it's front and in it's teeth. It's a zombie.

 Now you can stay and dodge the zombie and get the Clips (x2)
 or run. I think it is best to dodge it, grab the clips and
 run. Go to the Main Hall.

 Scene:
 ------
 When you arrive in the Hall you will find that Wesker and Jill
 are not there.

 Go pick up the gun on the floor. It's Jill's Beretta. Now go
 to the back of the table with the typewriter on it and take
 the Ink Ribbon. Now go across the hall and enter through the
 blue double doors.

 ---------------------------
 3.1.2 - A Spray In the Face
 ---------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 1st Floor Map
 Ink Ribbon
 Clip (x2)
 Sword Key
 Shells
 Wooden Crest (Emblem)
 Blue Jewel
 Wind Crest
 Music Notes

 You will find yourself in a gallery with a large statue in the
 middle. You can get the 1st floor map out of it by pushing the
 steps up to it and then climbing the steps.

 You can also push the chest out of they way and follow the
 hall down. There is a zombie on the floor, which you can kill
 or run past (Chris' left side) and search the shelves for an
 ink ribbon.

 Go back to the gallery and out to the main hall.

 Go up the stairs, to the second floor, and head to Chris'
 right staircase. Now go down the wall of the side of the 2nd
 floor hall that your on and enter the other door. Take the
 small key on the shelf. Follow the hall down to the other
 door.

 You will be on a terrace, follow it until you find Forest
 Speyer. He's been pecked to death by crows. Take his clip and
 run from the crows like mad back to the main hall.


     // ARMOR KEY \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the Advanced game, here with Forest you'll find  |
    | the Armor Key. Getting this key earlier than you    |
    | would normally means major changes will happen to   |
    | the games advancement through the mansion. You will |
    | do some similar and different events, however they  |
    | will eventually lead to the same conclusions.       |
    |                                                     |
    | With this key you can be lead to Richard early and  |
    | also open doors you normally couldn't until after   |
    | you'd been to the medical room where Rebecca is in  |
    | the normal version of the game.                     |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Enter through the double doors on the other side of the hall.
 You will be on the second floor of the dining room. Kill the
 zombies then push the statue off the edge of the 2nd floor
 through the gap. Now exit through the other single door in
 this hall. Go kill the three zombies here and go down the
 stairs. Kill the next two zombies and go into the closest door
 to the stairs.

 Scene:
 ------
 You will be sprayed by something. It turns out to be Rebecca
 Chambers the newest member of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. You will
 talk for a bit.

 Put away anything you won't need, like the combat knife. Go
 over to the bed and pick up the Sword Key. Now leave the room.


     // SWORD KEY \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the Advanced game, the Sword Key won't be in the |
    | medical room with Rebecca, instead you'll find it   |
    | in the small dining room near the attic. Before you |
    | can get to it, you'll need to move a cupboard and   |
    | also light the candle's with the lighter to see.    |
    |                                                     |
    | The lighter is in it's usual place (one of the      |
    | researchers bedrooms on the 2nd floor), accessible  |
    | with the Armor Key, just like the areas leading to  |
    | the room with the key in it.                        |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Video:
 ------
 Rebecca will talk then you will be asked: "Will you take
 Rebecca with you? Yes/No" Pick yes. Rebecca will talk a while,
 and then you will leave.

 Note: Anytime you go back there, Rebecca will heal you for
 nothing if you want.

 Kill the other zombie in the hall as you make your way around.
 You can't go through the door on the right wall because it is
 locked, so you will have to go through the other door beside
 it.

 Once through, kill the two zombies here and head down the
 right hallway. You can go into the room in the little bit with
 the zombie in it off the hall. Inside is a tiger statue, but
 you can't do anything here right now. The door on the opposite
 wall has a clip, a file paper, and a zombie hiding in the
 closet with some shells. Unlock and go out the door at the end
 of the hall.

 You will find yourself in a familiar looking hall. Go back the
 zombie hall, down to the door leading to the dining room. Once
 inside grab the wooden crest off the back wall and the remains
 of the statue you destroyed, down the side of the dining table
 for the Blue Jewel.

 Go back to the Tiger statue room and use the Blue Jewel on the
 statue to get the Wind Crest.


     // WIND CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | For the Advanced mode of Resident Evil you'll find  |
    | the Wind Crest moved to the Art Gallery, replacing  |
    | the Star Crest's location. Solve the painting       |
    | puzzle and you'll be give this crest.               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // BLUE JEWEL \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the ruins of the statue you pushed over earlier  |
    | will be the Sun Crest instead of the Blue Jewel in  |
    | the Advanced mode.                                  |
    |                                                     |
    | The Blue Jewel is found behind the Clock in the     |
    | Dining Room instead, and to access that you have to |
    | go Emblem swapping. More on that below.             |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // EMBLEM \\_________________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | A little bit of a change in the advanced game.      |
    | Instead the Emblem (Wooden Crest) is located on the |
    | 2nd floor in the armor room where the Sun Crest is  |
    | in the original game. You should already have the   |
    | Armor Key as noted earlier, so unlocking the room   |
    | is no problem. Once you have it you can return to   |
    | the dining room and continue with the puzzle.       |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back to the Zombie hall, and go the far upper end. There
 will be a wooden double door and a single red door. Use the
 sword key on the red door. You will now be in a Bar. Go around
 the corner and push the shelf that's in the way of another.
 Search the back shelf to find the music notes. Take them to
 the piano and use them on it. "Chris unfortunately can't read
 music"

 Scene:
 Chris tries to play the piano. Rebecca comes in and tries. You
 will be asked if you will let her. Say yes. Now leave to let
 her practice.

 Now lets go over to the other side of the mansion. Go back to
 the main hall and back through the blue double doors. Go to
 the single door at the back of the gallery and unlock it with
 the sword key, and discard it.

 ---------------------------------
 3.1.3 - And then came the dogs...
 ---------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Clip (x2)
 Green Herb (x6)
 Small Key
 Chemical
 Golden Crest
 Shield Key
 Armor Key
 Red Herb (x2)
 Shells
 Broken Shotgun

 Run down the hall until the Dog bursts through the window,
 kill it then go round the corner and kill the other one that
 breaks through the window. When they are dead push the chest
 in the middle of the second part of the hall to find a clip.
 Exit into the next room. There is a locked door to Chris' left
 and a green herb to his right. Follow the hall down, and go
 the first wooden door, in it is a bathroom. Empty the bath to
 get a small key. Now go back out and down the hall 'till you
 get to two other doors. One double, one single. Go into the
 double one. Kill the two zombies here. There should be three
 doors. Go in the one closest to the double doors. This should
 unlock it.

 Kill the zombie in the hall, grab the green herb, and go into
 the room under the stairs. Pick up the chemical, and open the
 item box. Put away the items you don't need and the chemical.
 You can also save if you want. Go out and up the stairs.


     // BROKEN SHOTGUN \\_________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | If you arrive in the storeroom in the Advanced Game |
    | you've probably found the Colt, but can't see the   |
    | Broken Shotgun. This is because it's been moved     |
    | into the save room under the stairs at the          |
    | northeast wing of the mansion, right near the good  |
    | shotgun. Makes getting it a tiny bit easier I       |
    | guess, and you really need it in the advanced game. |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // CHEMICAL \\_______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Because the shotgun is now where the Chemical was,  |
    | you need to go outside to find the chemical. Near   |
    | the bathroom in this wing is a metal door leading   |
    | outside to a boiler. Sitting right in front of it,  |
    | is the chemical you're looking for.                 |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Once at the top kill the zombies, and follow the corridor to
 the right side of the top of the stairs. There will be two
 doors. One won't open so go through the other door. You will
 unlock the door and you will find yourself in a "U-Shaped"
 hallway. Kill the zombie then go to Chris' right and past the
 double green doors, past the brown door, kill the next zombie
 then go to the door at the end of the hall. Go through it. Now
 go back to where Rebecca was playing the piano. She will be
 finished by now.

 When she has finished playing the "Moonlight Sonata," a secret
 door will open. Go inside and grab the golden crest, the door
 will close, replace the place where the golden crest was with
 the wooden crest to exit out of the room.

 Go back to the dining room and put the golden crest where the
 wooden one was, the clock will chime and then move away
 showing a secret compartment behind it. Go over there and grab
 the Shield Key. Yay, no more annoying tick, tick, tick, from
 the clock.


     // SHIELD KEY \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | The puzzle remains the same, the pieces are just    |
    | elsewhere and in a different order. First you need  |
    | to swap the Wooden Emblem for the Gold one from the |
    | Bar's secret room. Then put the Gold one in the     |
    | dining hall to get the Blue Jewel from behind the   |
    | clock, and take the Jewel to the Tiger Statue to    |
    | get the Shield Key from it.                         |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back to the save room where you met Rebecca. Take the
 chemical with you. Now go to where the two zombies were in the
 hall, where the Tiger Statue is. Follow the path in that
 direction and enter the door round the corner at the end.

 You will find yourself in a greenhouse, with a water pump on.
 Use the chemical in the water pump to kill the plant. Behind
 the plant are an armor key and six herbs, two red herbs, and
 four green herbs. Take what you can, and don't forget to
 combine.


     // STAR CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Instead of the Armor Key, which you would already   |
    | have, in the Advanced game you'll find the Star     |
    | Crest sitting in it's place.                        |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back out to the hall and go back to the save room, put away
 the herbs and take only your weapon & ammo and the Armor key,
 and the small key.

 Go to the other door in the hall that is locked and use the
 Armor key on it. Go inside. Grab the clip, get the shells out
 of the draw by using the small key. Pick up the broken
 shotgun, so that we can go get the shotgun now. You use it to
 swap it over for the shotgun to stop the ceiling from falling
 on you. Leave and head back to the hall past where the dogs
 came in through the windows.


     // COLT PYTHON \\____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the small storeroom, you'll find the Colt Python |
    | instead of the Broken Shotgun. These six shots will |
    | help you with a few tricky zombies or other enemy   |
    | setups between now and when you return to the       |
    | mansion (when you can get more ammo). So try to     |
    | make them count.                                    |
    |                                                     |
    | Later on, when you use the Red Jewel on the Tiger   |
    | statue, like how you would get the Colt in the      |
    | original game, you'll find three lots of Colt ammo  |
    | instead. Still well worth sticking your neck out    |
    | for.                                                |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 --------------------------------
 3.1.4 - ...and then the Snake...
 --------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Shotgun
 Sun Crest
 Lighter
 Clip (x2)
 Red Herb
 Ink Ribbon
 Shells (x4)
 Green Herb (x3)
 2nd Floor Map
 Moon Crest

 Go to the single door across from the double doors that lead
 to the save room. Walk through the room your in and into the
 other door. Once in the next room grab the shotgun on the wall
 and put the broken one in its place and return back to the
 save room under the stairs. Go up the stairs to the second
 floor. Go to the right of the main hall and into the U-Shaped
 hall. Go past the wooden door and unlock it with the Armor
 key, but don't go in. Now go around to the double green doors
 and enter them.

 Once inside the trick here is to cover up the vents with the
 large statues and then flick the switch, when that is done the
 case at the end will drop allowing you to get the Sun Crest.

 Now follow the hall around and go back to the area by the
 stairs above the save room where you got the chemical. Go past
 the stairs and unlock the first door on the right-hand wall.
 Once inside kill the zombie and go to Chris' right, and enter
 the door there. You will find the lighter on the top of the
 bookshelf, a shells beside the right bed and right wall, and a
 red herb between the left bed and the left wall.

 Go back out and into the other room. In here check the jacket
 by the door for an ink ribbon, and the table for some notes.
 Go to the panel on the wall where it's broken and check it.
 The tank will empty and allow you to push it away from the
 wardrobe. Now you can push the wardrobe where the tank was and
 find the secret stash of shells.

 Go back out to the corridor with the stairs, but keep heading
 the direction you got to the previous rooms, and enter the
 blue door at the end. Inside will be a locked single red door,
 a green herb, and a fireplace. Check the fire and it will say:
 "Wood is put in the stove, A paper is on the wall." Use your
 lighter on the fire to get the 2nd floor map.

 Go back to the save room where you got the chemical, and put
 away everything except the lighter, shield key, and the
 shotgun with shells (if you feel like it).  It would also be
 an excellent time to save, trust me.

 Now go back to the U-shaped hall and go into the single wooden
 door you unlocked earlier. Grab the two green herbs once
 inside, then go around the corner. You will find Richard
 Aiken, from Bravo Team, but he is dead. Examine him for a
 clip.

 Go into the door behind Richard. Move forward and kill the
 zombie, and follow the hall down behind where he was and enter
 the door where he was. You should be in a room with a table
 and two closets. The table has some candles on it, use the
 lighter on these to light up the room. There is a clip in the
 back closet by the pictures of planets and the clock. You can
 push the other closet away to reveal a passage with another
 closet at the end. Search this for some shells.

 Go back to the area where you killed that last zombie, and go
 up the steps and use the shield key on the door then discard
 it. Go into the attic.

 Run forward once inside and you will be confronted by one huge
 Snake. You have two options, get rid of it if you have the
 shotgun with shells on you, or avoid it. No 1. Is easy to
 explain, hard to do. No 2. Is hard to explain, even harder to
 do. ":|

 No 1. Stand your ground and shoot it with shells until it runs
 off.

 No 2. Wait until it is halfway round the other side of the
 post from you and run.

 You're going for the hole where it came out from, to get the
 moon crest. On your way out, grab the shells sitting on some
 barrels in the middle of the left wall (the side with the exit
 door). Once you exit and get down the steps something may
 happen.


     // MOON CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | When you grab the Moon Crest in the advanced game,  |
    | you'll be in for a bit of a surprise. It's only     |
    | half of the crest. Instead you'll need to track     |
    | down the remaining half of the crest in the mansion.|
    |                                                     |
    | The other half is hidden in one of the researchers  |
    | bedrooms on the 2nd floor of the mansion. To get it |
    | you'll need to empty a fish tank, and move it and a |
    | wardrobe to access a hidden cupboard with the other |
    | half of the crest inside.                           |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Variations:
 -----------
 If you didn't get bitten once, nothing will happen. Go to the
 save room where you got the chemical, And read the guide from
 the star (*) onwards.

 If you got bitten you will faint, and Rebecca will turn up,
 and you will have to get the serum in the save room.

 Take Rebecca to the save room where you met her and go get the
 serum off the shelf beside the Item Box. Now go back to where
 Chris is. Once you have been cured go to the other save room
 where you got the chemical.

 -------------------------------------------------
 3.1.5 - Wind + Moon + Sun + Stars = New... Death?
 -------------------------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Star Crest
 Square Crank
 Red Herb (x2)
 Green Herb (x5)
 Blue Herb (x4)

 Leave the save room and head out the door at the end of the
 hall.

 Now go to the end of this hall, where the second zombie was
 and enter the door (You can't enter the other single door in
 the hall because it's locked).

 Once inside, you will hear crows. They wont attack unless you:

 - Get a switch wrong in here
 - Fire a shot.

 Now read the first painting.
 The title is "Give Me Peaceful Sleep."

 Now the paintings are in this order:
 1. A picture of a tired middle-aged man
 2. A picture of a newborn baby
 3. A picture of a young man
 4. A picture of a infant
 5. A picture of a lively boy
 6. A picture of a bold-looking old man.

 You have to put these in the correct order. That is:

 2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6,

 After pressing the last one, go to the last painting which
 says:

 "Give me the peace of death, and I'll give you the joy of
 life."

 Press the switch and the painting will fall giving you the
 Star Crest. Now go out of the gallery, and go straight ahead
 of the door, till you reach a metal door. Go out it.

 Shoot the dog in the passageway, and go to the end. There is a
 metal panel, which says: "When the sun sets in the west and
 the moon rises in the east, stars will begin to appear in the
 sky and wind will blow towards the ground. Then the gate of
 new life will open." Meaning you have got to put the four
 crests in the plate to open the door.

 Inside the next room are some steps that you push towards the
 camera a bit, then push towards the high shelf on the back
 wall. Climb up the steps and grab the square crank. Climb back
 down and go out the other door.

 You will find yourself outside, shoot the three dogs and get
 the herbs. There are two red herbs, three green herbs, and two
 blue herbs. If you hear a beeping sound that is your radio. Go
 into the status screen and select radio to use it and hear a
 message from Brad. Go down the left path to find the map of
 GARDEN, then go down the right path, and through the large
 rusted metal gate. Follow the path round the water and use the
 square crank on the box you find this will empty out the
 water. Go down the path that was in the water and up the other
 side. Run along the path, dodging the small snakes and hop on
 the lift down.

 When you get to the bottom kill the three dogs here. You will
 find a dead lift, with a hole in the wall for a battery. A
 waterfall, and another gate, Go through this other gate.

 There are two blue herbs and two green herbs but you can't
 pick them up until you have got rid of the dogs here. Once you
 have killed the three dogs and picked up the herbs follow the
 twisting passage until you come to a door.

 C. Room Key
 Ink Ribbon (x2)
 002 Dormitory Key

 Move around the statue and grab the three blue herbs. Now move
 the statue down the hall until the next hall that leads off
 it. Push it up that one and cover the hole. Now that that is
 done, go into the single wooden door on the right side (the
 one without a metal panel above the door).

 Inside you will find an item box and typewriter, along with a
 First Aid Spray and a clip. Leave when you are ready and go
 across the hall to the other single wooden door.

 When inside forget about the door to Chris' left (for now),
 and kill the two zombies. Go search the cup over at the far
 side of the room to get a small key. Open the draw with the
 small key to get some shells, pick up the red book on the bed.
 Now go into the other door. Unfill the bath by examining it.
 You will get the C. Room Key.


     // RED BOOK \\_______________________________________

    | The advanced game moves the Red Book from the bed   |
    | here to a table in the Bar/RecRoom at the end of    |
    | hallway outside. Not a major change.                |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back out to the main hall. You can go in the double
 doors at the end. Inside is a bar, with a clip and an Ink
 ribbon, oh and um, two spiders. Go up the hall where you put
 the statue and go through the door. Go up the new hall to the
 door.

 Go in the door, run across to the other side of the room (all
 the doors in here are locked) and beside the bees nest is a
 table with the 002 Dormitory Key on it. Take the key then
 sprint away from the bees. Go back out to the hall and down to
 the door at the end that you haven't been to. There is a
 statue you can push and behind it are three green herbs. Now
 go to the door.

 This is the 002 door so use the key. There is a door to
 Chris' left. All that's in there is a zombie and a clip. In
 the main room, check the draw for some shells, and get the map
 of the GUARDHOUSE off the wall. Now push the closets aside to
 find a ladder to the basement.


     // DORM KEY 003 \\___________________________________

    | In the Advanced game, in the small bathroom with    |
    | the zombie and a clip, the clip is replaced with    |
    | the 003 Dorm Room Key. This greatly alters the game |
    | as it means you're heading there first. The         |

 Annoying Puzzle 1. Pushing the Crates to make a bridge.
 -------------------------------------------------------

 Run past the first crate we'll be back later for it. The first
 two are very straightforward. Just push them into the water.

 The third one though, is a pain. You have to push it away from
 the water direction, towards the ladder. When it's so far get
 it half way from the corner and push it to the left wall, now
 push it all the way down the corridor to the end and then push
 it in the water. If this is confusing for you, I made this map
 to show you where to go:


       ======================
       =                    == LADDER

 =======  +     =
 WATER    +     =
 C1 C2 ++++     =
 ================


 Once you have done that there are two green herbs to pick up.
 Now go through the water and through the door.

 WARNING: Go to the Chris' right, if you go to the Left it
 equals instant death.

 Run through the water until you get near two doors together.
 Go to the left door. You will use the C. Room Key, and discard
 it. Once inside flick the switch beside the Red flashing
 light. This will drain the water. Now go over to the switch by
 the door, this will unlock the door beside this one. Go out
 into the main room. You don't have to worry about the sharks
 anymore, they are high n' dry.

 Go in the door beside the control room. This is the weapons
 storage but most of the stuff in here is wet. There are two
 boxes of shells and two clips and the 003 dormitory key, Leave
 and go back upstairs and to the large hall with the bees, and
 use the 003 key on the single door without the keypad.

 Once inside go into the door on the left of Chris. Inside is
 another zombie and some clip. Go back to the main room, inside
 the draw is an ink ribbon. Go to the bookshelf and take the
 white book. Now put in the red book, the other shelf will move
 away, showing a secret door. Note: It would be good to have
 the Shotgun ready and loaded for the next part, and some
 healing items as well. Saving the game might also help. When
 you are ready, go through the door.

 Inside is one extremely large plant, this is the Plant 42 that
 you have read about.

 Scene:
 ------
 The plant will pick Chris up. Chris will start yelling, and
 Rebecca hears this. She comes and sees Chris. He chucks her
 the file to make V-Jolt. Now Rebecca leaves.

 Now you are controlling Rebecca again. Go over to the door
 with the keypad and push the following numbers: Either 3,4,5
 or 2,1,5,

 Now enter the room. Once inside you have to make the V-Jolt.
 Here's how to:

 1 = WATER
 2 = UMB NO.2
 4 = UMB NO.4

 Fill a bottle with 1, and one with 2. Mix to get 3.  1+2=3
 Fill a bottle with 4, and mix with 3 to get 7.       4+3=7
 Fill a bottle with 2, and one with 4. Mix to get 6.  2+4=6
 Mix 7 with 6 to get 13.                              7+6=13
 Fill a bottle with 1, and one with 2. Mix to get 3.  1+2=3
 Mix 13 with 3 to make 16 or V-Jolt.                  13+3=16
                                                      -------
                                                       V-Jolt

 Take the V-Jolt to the basement, and use it on the roots. Now
 leave.

 The game will go back to Chris, and the plant will drop him.
 Now it's up to him to finish it off. Start shooting at it, but
 don't get too close because it will hit you with it's vines,
 and don't stay in the same place too long or part of the
 ceiling will fall on you. When you finish it off go over to
 the fireplace and take the helmet key, then leave.

 Head back to the Guardhouse save room.

 Scene:
 When you get to the hall, you will hear firing. Chris will run
 around the corner and find Wesker killing some bees. That will
 talk and Wesker will tell Chris to go look at the rest of the
 mansion, then he leaves.

 Go to the save room and put away any unnecessary items away
 and save. Now leave the guardhouse; back out to the garden.

 3.1.7 - Crap! The hunters, always with the hunters!

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Magnum Rounds (x3)
 Doom Book 1
 Eagle Medal (in Doom Book 1)
 Shells (x5)
 First Aid Spray
 Clip (x2)
 Green Herb (x5)
 Small Key
 Battery
 Blue Herb
 MoDisk
 Ink Ribbon
 Red Jewel
 Colt Python

 Make your way across the garden, the same way you made it to
 the guardhouse, and into the mansion picking up any herbs you
 could not take the first time. When you get to the crest hall,
 where you put the four crests to unlock the door, equip the
 shotgun.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 When you go inside and get down the hall a bit this video
 takes place. Something sprints across the yard climbs up the
 elevator shaft, runs straight through to the door outside the
 mansion and opens it.

 Scene:
 ------
 You now see what it is.

 Shoot the "Hunter" with the shotgun, be careful that it does
 not jump. If you're still alive after that, well done you just
 killed one of the toughest common enemies in the game. However
 there are many more to come. With the Helmet key you now have
 access to areas that were locked before, and the first one is
 the only locked door in the hall you are in.

 Once inside this dark room, go over to the desk and search it.
 It will tell you there is a switch, so push it. The room will
 light up. Grab the Magnum Rounds off the table, and the red
 book to the right of the door. This is the doom book 1. Go
 into the options, highlight the book, select it, and go to
 check, and check it. If you look at the cover it will say
 "nothing important" but it you check it when you have rotated
 the book so that the pages are facing the screen, the book
 will open up and you will find the eagle medal. Now go out of
 this room.

    |_____________________________________________________|


 Head to the save room where you got the chemical. Outside, on
 the wall is a note telling you that there are some items left
 for you in the save room. Go into it. Inside on the floor are
 some shells, a first aid spray, and a clip. Take them and get
 ready for another boss battle. Take the shotgun and shells and
 one red/green herb or first aid spray, plus the helmet key.
 Now leave and go upstairs.

 Kill the hunters at the top, and go down the hall and into the
 room where the fireplace is and where you got the second floor
 map. Now unlock the single red door with the helmet key. Once
 inside, go over to the piano and examine it, you will then be
 attacked.

 Scene:
 ------
 Out of the fireplace comes that darn snake again. He heads for
 you and tries to eat you. It misses and makes a hole in the
 floor, now it's time to kill it.

 Use the shotgun until it's dead, then go check the hole it
 made.

 Drop down the hole when it asks. When you are at the bottom,
 check the grave, and press the switch you find. This will move
 the grave and show a ladder. Climb down it. This next bit may
 be confusing so I have drawn a map to show you where to go:

 When you get down the ladder, kill the approaching zombie, but
 instead of going straight for the door, go around the corner
 and kill the zombie and take the shells, as shown on the map.
 Now go through the door. Follow the passage round until you
 find two zombies eating a corpse on the ground, kill them and
 take the two green herbs behind them. Now go through the other
 door in this hall and you will find yourself in the kitchen.
 Go grab the small key on the stove top. Don't go up the stairs
 shown on the map, go kill the zombie on the floor, and take
 the lift.

 When you arrive at the top kill the zombie to Chris' right,
 and follow the hallway around, and go into the first door you
 see. Inside should be a battery and two lots of shells. Now go
 back out. You can keep going the way you are heading but all
 that is out the other door is a long hallway with three
 zombies and two green herbs and a blue herb. Also the door at
 the end is locked. Go back past the lift and kill the zombie
 there.


     // BATTERY #1 \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | The Battery is now located in the small hidden room |
    | off the library. For more details check the info    |
    | in the paragraph after the info on Doom Book #1.    |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 In the little nook beside the lift has a green herb. Go into
 the double blue doors. This is the library. Kill the zombie,
 and check the draw to the left of Chris. Inside is some magnum
 rounds. Go to the back of the room and kill the zombie there.
 Now go to the back single door and go through.

 Go between the shelves, using the gap right in front of the
 door, you will run into a statue. Push it forward until you
 can move around it. Now push it forward, towards the camera
 until the angle changes. Push the red button under the bust on
 the wall to shine a light to show you where to put the statue.

 When it's in place a secret part will open up. Search the desk
 there to get the MODisk.


     // DOOM BOOK #1 \\___________________________________

    | advanced game is the Doom Book #1. Check it as if   |
    | you were reading it to find the medal hidden inside.|
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back out to the main library. Up from where you got the
 magnum rounds out of the draw, is a bookshelf by itself, push
 it to find a secret door. Go through it. Inside will be an ink
 ribbon on the table, and a clip on the shelf. Go back out and
 go to the lift and take it back down. Now back in the kitchen,
 go around to the door leading to the stairs.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 A thing walking down the stairs and opening the door. What
 could it be!!!!

 Video:
 ------
 Oh, no it's a, a...zombie. Wow, amazing, yay!

 Kill the stupid zombie, and go up the stairs. Follow the hall
 around to the double doors and unlock them. Go through.

 You will be in a hall that looks very familiar. Kill the
 hunters in here or run past them, and go to the save room
 where you got the serum from, killing any hunters in the way.

 When you get there put away any unnecessary items and only
 take the helmet key and your shotgun and shells. Go back out
 and up the stairs. Kill the hunter at the hallway at the top,
 and use the Helmet key on the door closest to the stairs (The
 other door has a keypad that you use the code that Barry gave
 you bit it only leads to the Library and lift areas). Now
 discard the key.

 Once inside, you can grab the file on the table and the shells
 and the magnum rounds on the shelf beside the table. Push the
 steps forward so that they are underneath the deer head by the
 fireplace. Now go flick the switch by the door to make the
 room dark. Go over to the stairs and climb up them, face the
 deer and examine it. You will get the Red Jewel.

 Now head back to the Tiger Statue Room and use it on the
 statue to get the Colt Python. Time to kick some ass. Note:
 don't waste all the ammo you get on the hunters. You'll need
 it for later.


     // COLT AMMO \\______________________________________

    | As mentioned earlier when you received the Colt in  |
    | the advanced game, using the Red Jewel on the       |
    | statue gives you 3 lots of Colt ammo. Well worth    |
    | the effort still.                                   |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now, head back to the save room where you got the chemical.
 The best way to do this is to go from the statue room, through
 the zombie hallway, through the dining room, across the main
 hall, through the little gallery, down the hall where the dogs
 went through the windows (there are two spiders in here but if
 you run they will drop from the ceiling after you go past),
 along the hall, shooting the hunter with the colt, and go back
 to the save room.

 Take the Colt Python and rounds, the square crank, and the
 battery with you. Go back outside killing the hunter in the
 crest path, across to where the small snakes are, and down the
 lift. Run over to where the other lift is, and put the battery
 in to use it. Get on the lift and ride it to the top. Once
 your up at the top, go down the path and go to the pool area
 where you drained the water.

 Use the crank on the device that opened the gate, to close it.
 Now the area will be full of water again. Go back to the lift
 you used to get here and go back down. You will find when you
 get to the bottom that the waterfall is gone and that there
 was a ladder behind it. Go down the ladder.

 Go into the door on Chris' right. There is flame-thrower No 1.
 but it sucks so don't take it. Go to the path on Chris' left
 and through the door. Kill any hunters, and go over to the
 machinery to find a First Aid Spray and some shells. Now go
 down the little passage that leads off the first room and go
 into the door there. Run down the hallway round the corner.

 Scene:
 ------
 Chris will come across Enrico. Enrico will callout double-
 crosser to Chris before being shot by a mysterious person.

 You can examine Enrico to get a clip. Go around the corner and
 kill the two hunters then pick up the Hex. Crank that is on
 the ground. Now go out the door. Kill the hunter that is on
 the screen and head to where it was standing and go out the
 door. Kill the hunter here and go out the door in the area
 where the flame-thrower is.

    | Enrico will be holding the Hex. Crank instead of    |
    | the clip.                                           |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now you are back where you started. Go down the hallway, and
 past a Typewriter (you can save if you have an ink ribbon).
 Now go around the corner and you will find you can't go any
 farther because there is a hole in the floor. Use the Hex.
 Crank on the panel in the wall so you can get past and go
 through the door at the end. Once through grab the Flame
 -thrower No 2. You need this for later.

 Now go around the corner to Chris' left and up to the large
 boulder that's there. Turn around and run away from it.

 Scene:
 ------
 That bolder starts moving after you. I know I've seen this
 somewhere before? But where? :p

 Keep running until you reach the door where you came in here.
 The bolder will smash a hole in the wall at the end, instead
 of crushing you. Go up to where the boulder was. When you do a
 hunter comes in, kill it and be happy. That was the last one
 of the game. You can start singing about it now. When you're
 finished, go pick up the magnum rounds in the little cubbyhole
 in the wall. Go to the area the boulder made in wall and go
 through the door with your colt ready.

 First there was the snake, then the plant, then the snake
 again, now it's the huge spider. Shoot it with your colt about
 six times and it should die. Watch your health carefully. When
 it's dead exit the room and come back in to get rid of the
 baby spiders. Grab the combat knife and cut away at the spider
 web to open the door.

 Go up the path to Chris' left and in the door. Great, a save
 room. Grab the ink ribbon, first aid spray, and the blue herb.
 Save. Heal. Take the eagle medal/doom book 1, Hex. Crank, and
 the colt and rounds. Go back out and down to the other end of
 the pathway, and use the flame-thrower no 2. to get through
 the door.

 You will be in a room with two paths. One has a lift at the
 end and the other leads to another passage. Take the one that
 leads to the other passage. Follow it until you can't go any
 farther because there is a hole in the ground, so use the hex.
 crank on the panel three times so that the hole is on the left
 wall. Run up to the boulder and do what you did the last time.

 Run into the hole in the left wall that we made by using the
 crank and wait for the boulder to go past. Go up to where the
 boulder was to get the map of UNDERGROUND and in the cubbyhole
 there is the 2nd MoDisk.

    | Instead of the 2nd MODisc, you'll find the 2nd Doom |
    | Book in the Advanced game. Check it as if           |
    | you were reading it to find the medal hidden inside.|
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Inside the hole we made by using the crank is a door. Go
 through it. This is Annoying Puzzle No. 2.

 Annoying Puzzle No. 2 - Silly Pressure Plate.

 ===PP======DDDD========


 Take the statue and move it to where the moving wall is. Now
 use the hex. crank on the crank hole once to move the statue
 out, and once again to move the wall back in. Push the statue
 to the pressure plate to open up the panel to get the Doom
 Book 2. Do the same thing that you did with the Doom Book 1 to
 get the Wolf medal.

    | Instead of the 2nd Doom Book being here (you would  |
    | have gotten it already), the Lab Key (or P. Room    |
    | Key will be hidden behind the panel).               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back to the passage with the lift and take it up to the
 garden. When you get to the top don't bother about the metal
 doors to Chris' left. They are welded shut. Go and pick up the
 two green herbs and the two blue herbs. Now go over to the
 fountain and use the eagle and wolf medals on the sides of the
 fountain. The Eagle medal on the left side and the wolf medal
 on the right side.

 The water empties out and a metal covering opens up while the
 outside of the fountain separates to make a path.

 Walk to the opening and down the steps. Get into the lift and
 ride it down.

 ---------------------------------------------------------
 3.1.9 - Gee, no, not a lab. What will they think of next!
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Green Herb (x4)
 3rd MoDisk
 Clip
 Slides
 Ink Ribbon (x2)
 Pass-code01
 Lab Key
 Shells
 Red Herbs
 Magnum Rounds (x2)
 Pass-code02
 Blue Herb
 Pass-code03

 Walk around the corner. You can't get through the door yet so
 go down the ladder. Put away anything in the item box down
 here. Be sure to take the two MoDisks and your colt with you,
 then go out the door. There are three zombies and two green
 herbs here for you to get. Go around the corner away from the
 stairs, past the locked door and get the 3rd MoDisk off the
 table.


     // BIODATA SLIDES \\_________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Instead of the 3rd MODisc, you'll find the data     |
    | slides you can use in the Visual Data Room sitting  |
    | on the table instead.                               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back to the stairs and go down them. Shoot the zombie there
 and go into the double doors to Chris' right. Now go into the
 single door on her left. Turn on the red switch, for some
 light. Go to the desk and pick up the file. Read it. You have
 to get the pass-code. So far you have: JOHN and ADA. This is
 the code in the file:


 =     =    = =    =    =     =
 ==   ==   =   =   ==   ==   ==
 = = = =    = =    = =  = = = =

 ==   ==    = =    =    =     =
 =     =   =   =   =    =     =


 This is the code that has to be worked out. On the painting on
 the other side is similar patterns, they are:


 By the Tree:
 ------------

   =   = = =   =     =   =     =
  ===   ===    ==   ==   ==   ==

 =     =   =  =     =  =       = =  =         =


 Now push the shelf aside to find a purple switch. This will
 change the writing on the painting to what it is. Which is

 TREE
 APPLE
 MAN
 WOMAN

 You take the symbols and swap them for letters and you get
 the final passcode - MOLE.

 JOHN, ADA, MOLE. These are the pass-codes. Before you leave
 take the green herb by the painting and the clip in the box by
 the sink.

 Head back out to the main room by the stairs, but this time go
 forward, to the left of the stairs. Run down the hall shooting
 any zombies in the way and go in the double doors at the end.


     // MODISC #2 \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | When you enter this lab in the advanced game, check |
    | the area at the back of the room to find the 2nd    |
    | MODisc sitting on the shelf.                        |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Once inside grab the slides lying on the floor, then go and
 use the computer. After all the computer start-up screens, you
 will be asked for the Login code: JOHN, then the password:
 ADA.

 You will then be asked which floor you would like to unlock,
 select B2, then enter the Password when prompted: MOLE.

 This will unlock B2. Now select B3 and it will unlock. Now
 select cancel to get out of the computer. Leave the room and
 go back to the hall outside John the researcher's room. Go
 down the hall and enter the only other single metal door. Kill
 the four zombies and check the boxes under the Excite! 1998
 poster for an ink ribbon. Now go over to the desk. On the desk
 is a pass-code output machine. Use one of the MoDisk's on it
 to get the Pass-code01. One down, two more to go.

 Leave and go upstairs and enter the double doors beside where
 you got the third MoDisk. Once inside use the slides on the
 projector to get some info on the monsters and other assorted
 stuff (Gee, THAT guy looks like Wesker, I wonder why???). Now
 go over to the panel on the wall, and open it; then press the
 button. The pillar on the wall will move across, showing a
 secret shelf. Search the shelf to find the lab key.


     // MODISC #3 \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Instead of the Lab Key being hidden, you'll find    |
    | the 3rd and final MODisc here in the Advanced game. |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back downstairs, killing any zombies in the way, and go
 unlock the door with the red biohazard marking on the floor
 using the lab key, then discard it (the other double doors in
 this room are locked). Once you are through, go into the
 double doors on Chris' left. Inside is a medical lab, and this
 is the location of Annoying Puzzle No 3. Here is how to get
 past it.

 Annoying Puzzle No. 3 - The Box Trip.
 -------------------------------------

 This is how the room is when you enter it:


 ============================
 =          GG              =       KEY:
 =          GG              =	      H1 = VENT HOLE 1
 =                          =	      H2 = VENT HOLE 2
 =                          =	      D = DOOR
 =  H1        C2C2          =	      F = SHELF
 V       SSSS C2C2BBBBB     =       E = EQUIPMENT
 V  T    SSSS C1C1BBBBB     =       B = BED
 =            C1C1BBBBB     =	      C1 = CRATE 1
 =  H2            BBBBB     =	      C2 = CRATE 2
 =                BBBBB     =       S = STAIRS
 =   EEEE   EEEE            =	      T = TRIGGER
 =   EEEE   EEEE            =	      G = GRATE
 =                    FFFF  =	      V = VENT SHAFT
 =========DDDDDDDD===========


 1. First grab the shells off the bed and the red herb off the
    shelf.
 2. Move the steps up to where the grate is, but be sure there
    is enough room for you to walk right around it.
 3. Now move crate 2 over towards vent hole 1, but push it up
    once towards the grate then push it over vent hole 1 to
    make sure you have it over it.
 4. Now push crate 1 up to where crate 2 was, and push it out
    so that you can move right round it.
 5. Now push crate 1 down to the equipment, and then push it
    over the vent hole 2.
 6. Push crate 1 up once to make it cover vent hole 2 properly.
 7. Push the stairs back down to the gap where the trigger is.
    If done correctly the trigger will click, but no gas will
    come out.
 8. Climb up the steps and go through the vent shaft.

 This is what the room should be like after you have moved them
 around:


 ============================
 =          GG              =	      KEY:

 =C2C2                      =       F = SHELF
 VSSSS            BBBBB     =       E = EQUIPMENT

 =                    FFFF  =	      V = VENT SHAFT
 =========DDDDDDDD===========


 Once you're out the other side, check the shelves to Chris'
 right for some magnum rounds. Run forward and use another
 MoDisk to get the pass-code02. Now leave through the double
 doors.

 You will be back out in the main hall bit. Kill the zombies
 here then go back through the door that you unlocked with the
 lab key. Run forward, taking out any zombies in your way and
 go into the single metal door straight ahead. The games last
 save room. In here to pick up are some magnum rounds, a green
 herb and a blue herb, and an ink ribbon hidden to the left
 corner of the white shelf where the flame rounds are.

 Take your colt, and the last MoDisk, and a First Aid Spray/Red
 Green herb mixture. Leave and head down the hall outside. At
 one end is a lift that has no power, and at the other is the
 doors to the power room. Head to the power room.

 Now this is where it gets tricky. Head down the path to Chris'
 right, dodging any Chimeras in your way (don't shoot them,
 it's a waste of ammo). You should come to a power panel.
 Switch it on to power up all the levels.


     // BATTERY #2 \\_____________________________________

    | Unlike in the original where you find the Battery   |
    | needed for the end lift right beside it, the        |
    | Battery is located in this power room in the        |
    | advanced game.                                      |
    |                                                     |
    | If you walk around the room here you should find    |
    | the battery sitting on the floor somewhere near the |
    | back.                                               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back past the door where you came in, and go down one
 of the other paths as they all lead to the other door at the
 back. In this next room, run forward straight down the path
 to the last pass-code output machine. Use the last MoDisk on
 it to get the last pass-code, passcode03. Now head down the
 other path in this room that you went past and follow it to
 the next door.

 This room is free of monsters. Go to the left side of the
 machinery, there will be a monitor. This is the power
 connection switch. Turn it on to turn on the power for the
 lift. Now go back through all that and go to the lift. Go to
 the right of the lift and push the switch there to power the
 lift.

 Scene:
 ------
 Rebecca turns up and they talk about getting out of the
 mansion.

 Ride the lift up.

 Scene:
 ------
 When you get to the top, you will come around the corner and
 be confronted by Wesker. Wesker will point his gun at your
 head. Wesker is the traitor. After listening to Wesker talk
 about the bio-weapons tell him that he killed some of the
 S.T.A.R.S. by his own hand, he shoots Rebecca.

 He now plans to show you the Tyrant, and let it kill you. You
 then go into the lab, and see the Tyrant.

 CGI Video:

 The Tyrant in all its bio-weapon glory.

 Scene:
 ------
 Wesker frees the tyrant after Chris makes some comments about
 the Tyrant. He pushes the keys on the panel, and this frees
 the Tyrant, but instead of him attacking you he attacks and
 kills Wesker, then he pursues you. Now it's up to you to stop
 him, so get to it.

 Run around shooting him with the Colt, until he collapses. Try
 not to get to close though. Go over to Wesker and pick up the
 Master Key. Go over to the panel, and examine it.

 Scene:
 ------
 Chris flicks the switch to unlock the door.

 Go back to the lift.

 Scene:
 When you're out of the lab, Rebecca is standing!?! Bulletproof
 vest. You will take the lift and ride it down. Rebecca will
 run off ahead to blow the place up when you get to the bottom.

 Go to the save room and save, then go to the area by the
 bottom of the stairs on this level, killing anything in the
 way.

 Variation:
 ----------
 If you are going for the Good ending ignore the next part of
 the guide and join back at the #############. If you are going
 for the Good+ ending read on.

 Go into the double doors beside the stairs, past where John's
 room, past where you got the first pass-code, and to the
 double doors at the end with the panel beside it. Use the
 three pass-codes on the lock. Go through the door, and follow
 the hallway down to the next door.

 Scene:
 ------
 Chris finds Jill and they talk.

 Go back to the main room.

 Go up the stairs. Kill the zombies and follow the hall around
 and through the door. Put away all weapons and items, and take
 all the first aid sprays/mixed herbs you have left. Fill your
 inventory with these, except for one slot, then climb up the
 ladder. Now you can enter the double doors.

 Follow the path around and pick up the battery, and use it in
 the hole to start the lift.

 Scene:
 ------
 A timer for three minutes will count down, and who ever are
 with you will talk, then you will ride the lift.

 Now outside at the heliport, check the box to Chris' right for
 the flare. Move out to the middle and light the flare. The
 helicopter will come.

 Prepare for the final battle.

 Scene:

 -----------------------------
 3.1.13  - How To Kill Rebecca
 -----------------------------

 How to: Way #1

 1. First, do NOT meet Rebecca in the serum room on the 1st
    floor. Instead, get the Armor key first and go to the room
    where you would normally find Richard dead.
 2. You'll see Rebecca treating Richard and she will ask you to
    get the serum from the serum room. Go down to the serum
    room.
 3. Take the serum, but do NOT take it back to Richard.
    Instead, put it in the item box.
 4. Go about the game as normal for a while and then check to
    make sure Richard has died. If Rebecca is still there, just
    do some more stuff to kill time.
 5. Continue through the game as normal until you get to the
    guardhouse.
 6. Do NOT read the Plant 42 report on the bed and do NOT look
    at Plant 42's roots.
 7. If done correctly, when you meet up with Plant 42, it
    should pick you up and just whip you at the ground and you
    have to kill it alone.
 8. Go back to the mansion and after you kill the first the
    Hunter or escape from it, you will hear Rebecca scream! She
    is up in the Library room.
 9. Go in and you'll see Rebecca being attacked by a Hunter. To
    save her, just kill the hunter. To kill her off (her head
    gets chopped off), just leave the room and then go back in.

 How to: Way #2

 1. When you meet up with her in the serum room where she
    sprays you, tell her to stay put.
 2. Go through the game as normal.
 3. Again in the Guardhouse DO NOT pick up the Plant 42 report
    or see 42's roots.
 4. Defeat Plant 42.
 5. Kill or escape from the first Hunter and Chris will say,
    "What are they?! Monsters?! Rebecca! She's still in the
    house?!"
 6. Go through the small hallway (where the door is that leads
    to the tiger statue) and head to the Serum room
 7. You should find Rebecca being attacked by a Hunter (she
    gets clawed first). To save her, kill the Hunter. To fail,
    just leave the area.
 8. If you killed her off, you should go back (kill the Hunter
    first) and you'll find her in a corner with her head gone
    and Chris will give an Oscar performance of mourning.

 How to: Way #3

 1. When you meet up with her in the serum room where she
    sprays you, answer her with yes when she asks to go with
    you.
 2. Go through the game as normal.
 3. Defeat Plant 42.
 4. Go back to the mansion and after you kill the first the
    Hunter or escape from it, you will hear Rebecca scream! She
    is up in the Library room.
 5. Go in and you'll see Rebecca being attacked by a Hunter. To
    save her, just kill the hunter. To kill her off (her head
    gets chopped off), just leave the room and then go back in.

 Here is Jill's Walkthrough. This guide is to get the Good and
 Good+ Endings. To get the other two follow the instructions at
 end of the walkthrough.

 This is not a speed walkthrough, it's just so people can get
 the best out of Resident Evil.

 This is not a speed walkthrough; it's just so people can get
 the best out of Resident Evil. There are many rooms, which are
 not mentioned in this Walkthrough, these contain extra ammo,
 healing items, and files. Feel free to search these rooms at
 your choice and collect other items when required.

 Also there will be times where you will have to go to save
 rooms to put items away. When you do this is also up to you.

 Other than this, everything for the game is explained, so I'd
 advise use of this guide only if you are stuck on a certain
 area, wish to get through the game quickly, and don't care if
 puzzle answers are given to you exactly.

 Excuse my sometimes sarcastic titles for each section. I have
 no idea what I was thinking when I wrote them, but I liked
 most of them enough to keep them. :)

 If there is any thing important such as a movie of variation
 it will be marked like this:

 Well here is the walkthrough.


 ----------------------------
 3.2.1 - The Mansion Surprise
 ----------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Clips (x2)
 Lock-pick
 Ink Ribbon (x2)

 FMV Video:
 ----------
 Once you have selected Jill, you'll be shown a FMV of what
 happened to get the S.T.A.R.S. in this situation.

 Scene:
 ------
 After the movie style character intro, there will be a short
 intro. You'll hear a gun shot and Captain Wesker will send you
 to go find out what it is. Barry will join you.

 Once you're in the dining room and Barry has stated that fact
 run down to the other end of the table.

 Scene:
 ------
 Listen to Barry carry on about the blood the do as he says and
 look around.

 Go in the other door and go to Jill's left and around the
 corner.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 You hear a ripping of flesh and a pool of blood comes across
 the floor as a person looks over their shoulder, blood down
 it's front and in it's teeth. It's a zombie.

 Now you can stay and fight and get the Clips (x2) or run. I
 think it is best to shoot it so it falls over, grab the clips
 and run.

 Go back to Barry in the dining room.

 Scene:
 ------
 Jill will run to Barry. The Zombie will come in and Barry will
 kill it. Now you have to go see Wesker

 Go to the Main Hall.

 Scene:
 ------
 When you arrive in the Hall you will find that Wesker is not
 there. Barry will tell you to go search around. **Go up to the
 back wall under the stairs.** Come back and the rest of the
 video will play. Barry will give you a Lock-pick.

 When the video is finished go to the back of the table with
 the typewriter on it and take the Ink Ribbon. Now go across
 the hall and enter through the blue double doors.

 ----------------------------------------
 3.2.2 - The Evil has Arrived... Somewhat
 ----------------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Ink Ribbon
 Clip
 Green Herb
 Shotgun

 You will find yourself in a hall with a large statue in the
 middle. You can get the 1st floor map out of it by pushing the
 steps up to it and then climbing the steps.

 You can also push the chest out of they way and follow the
 hall down. There is a zombie on the floor, which you can kill
 or run past (Jill's left side) and search the shelves for an
 ink ribbon.

 Go back to the statue room and out the other single door,
 which you unlock with the lock-pick. Run down the hall until
 the Dog bursts through the window, kill it then go round the
 corner and kill the other one that breaks through the window.

 When they are dead push the chest in the middle of the second
 part of the hall to find a clip. Exit into the next room.
 There is a locked door to Jill's left and a green herb to her
 right. Follow the hall down, past the first wooden door, all
 that's behind it is a bathroom that has nothing inside, till
 you get to two other doors. One double, one single. Go into
 the single one.

 Walk through the room your in and into the other door. Once in
 the next room grab the shotgun on the wall, and return back to
 the double doors.

 On your way back, in the small room, you will find you can't
 open the door and that the roof is collapsing. Just stand
 there until Jill starts to panic.

 Scene:
 ------
 Jill yells about the door not opening, and Barry comes to her
 rescue.

 Now go through the double doors. Kill the two zombies here.
 There should be three doors. Go in the one closest to the
 double doors. This should unlock it.

 ---------------------------------
 3.2.3 - The Second Floor Is Above
 ---------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Green Herb
 Chemical
 Acid Rounds
 Bazooka

 Kill the zombie in the hall, grab the green herb, and go into
 the room under the stairs. Pick up the chemical, and open the
 item box. Put away the items you don't need and the chemical.
 You can also save if you want. Go out and up the stairs.


     // BROKEN SHOTGUN \\_________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | If you arrive in the storeroom in the Advanced Game |
    | you've probably found the Colt, but can't see the   |
    | Broken Shotgun. This is because it's been moved     |
    | into the save room under the stairs at the          |
    | northeast wing of the mansion, right near the good  |
    | shotgun. Of course if you've already gotten the     |
    | shotgun by letting Barry rescue you then this is    |
    | pointless.                                          |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // CHEMICAL \\_______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Because the shotgun is now where the Chemical was,  |
    | you need to go outside to find the chemical. Near   |
    | the bathroom in this wing is a metal door leading   |
    | outside to a boiler. Sitting right in front of it,  |
    | is the chemical you're looking for.                 |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Once at the top kill the zombies, and follow the corridor to
 the right side of the top of the stairs. There will be two
 doors. One won't open so go through the other door. You will
 unlock the door and you will find yourself in a "U-Shaped"
 hallway. Kill the zombie then go to Jill's right and past the
 double green doors, past the brown door, kill the next zombie
 then go to the door at the end of the hall. Go through it.

 Scene:
 ------
 Barry will be here on the second floor of the main hall. You
 will talk and Barry will give you the acid rounds then leave.

 Now go down the wall of the side of the 2nd floor hall that
 your on and enter the other door. Follow the hall down to the
 other door.

 You will be on a terrace, follow it until you find Forest
 Speyer. He's been pecked to death by crows. Take his bazooka
 and run from the crows like mad back to the main hall.


     // ARMOR KEY \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the Advanced game, here with Forest you'll find  |
    | the Armor Key. Getting this key earlier than you    |
    | would normally means major changes will happen to   |
    | the games advancement through the mansion. You will |
    | do some similar and different events, however they  |
    | will eventually lead to the same conclusions.       |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Enter through the door where Barry went, on the other side of
 the hall. You will be on the second floor of the dining room.
 Kill the zombies then push the statue off the edge of the 2nd
 floor through the gap. Now exit through the other single door
 in this hall. Kill the two zombies then go down the stairs.

 ------------------------------
 3.2.4 - Research and the Virus
 ------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Armor Key
 Red Herbs (x2)
 Green Herbs (x4)
 Clip (x2)
 Shells (x2)
 Broken Shotgun

 Kill the two zombies and enter the nearest door to the left of
 the stairs. Once inside the save room you can save and put
 away/take out items. Take the chemical with you. Go back out
 and follow the hallway right round, killing the zombie in the
 way. One door is locked the other is unlocked, so go out that
 one.

 A zombie will attack so kill it. Follow the path in the
 direction the behind the zombie, and enter the door round the
 corner at the end.

 You will find yourself in a greenhouse, with a water pump on.
 Use the chemical in the water pump to kill the plant. Behind
 the plant are an armor key and six herbs, two red herbs, and
 four green herbs. Take what you can, and don't forget to
 combine.


     // STAR CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Instead of the Armor Key, which you would already   |
    | have, in the Advanced game you'll find the Star     |
    | Crest sitting in it's place.                        |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back out to the hall and go back to the save room, put away
 the herbs and take only your weapon & ammo and the Armor key.

 Go to the other door in the hall that is locked and use the
 Armor key on it. Go inside. Grab the clip, get the shells out
 of the draw by using the lock-pick. Only pick up the broken
 shotgun if you haven't got the shotgun by now. Swap it over
 for the shotgun to stop the ceiling from falling on you. Leave
 and head back to the hall outside the greenhouse.


     // COLT PYTHON \\____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the small storeroom, you'll find the Colt Python |
    | instead of the Broken Shotgun. These six shots will |
    | help you with a few tricky zombies or other enemy   |
    | setups between now and when you return to the       |
    | mansion (when you can get more ammo). So try to     |
    | make them count.                                    |
    |                                                     |
    | Later on, when you use the Red Jewel on the Tiger   |
    | statue, like how you would get the Colt in the      |
    | original game, you'll find three lots of Colt ammo  |
    | instead. Still well worth sticking your neck out    |
    | for.                                                |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Take the opposite hall away from the greenhouse. You can go
 into the room in the little bit with the zombie in it off the
 hall. Inside is a tiger statue, but you can't do anything here
 right now. The door on the opposite wall has a clip, a file
 paper, and a zombie hiding in the closet with some shells.
 Unlock and go out the door at the end of the hall.

 ---------------------------
 3.2.5 - The Crests of Death
 ---------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Wooden Crest
 Blue Jewel
 Wind Crest
 Music Notes
 Golden Crest
 Shield Key

 You will find yourself in a familiar looking hall. Go back the
 zombie hall, down to the door leading to the dining room. Once
 inside grab the wooden crest off the back wall and the remains
 of the statue you destroyed, down the side of the dining table
 for the Blue Jewel.

 Go back to the Tiger statue room and use the Blue Jewel on the
 statue to get the Wind Crest.


     // WIND CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | For the Advanced mode of Resident Evil you'll find  |
    | the Wind Crest moved to the Art Gallery, replacing  |
    | the Star Crest's location. Solve the painting       |
    | puzzle and you'll be give this crest.               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // BLUE JEWEL \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | In the ruins of the statue you pushed over earlier  |
    | will be the Sun Crest instead of the Blue Jewel in  |
    | the Advanced mode.                                  |
    |                                                     |
    | The Blue Jewel is found behind the Clock in the     |
    | Dining Room instead, and to access that you have to |
    | go Emblem swapping. More on that below.             |
    |_____________________________________________________|


     // EMBLEM \\_________________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | A little bit of a change in the advanced game.      |
    | Instead the Emblem (Wooden Crest) is located on the |
    | 2nd floor in the armor room where the Sun Crest is  |
    | in the original game. You should already have the   |
    | Armor Key as noted earlier, so unlocking the room   |
    | is no problem. Once you have it you can return to   |
    | the dining room and continue with the puzzle.       |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back to the Zombie hall, and go the far upper end. There
 will be a wooden double door and a single red door. Use the
 lock-pick on the red door. You will now be in a Bar. Go around
 the corner and push the shelf that's in the way of another.
 Search the back shelf to find the music notes. Take them to
 the piano and use them on it. Jill will play the "Moonlight
 Sonata," A lovely piece of music. When she has finished, a
 secret door will open. Go inside and grab the golden crest,
 the door will close, replace the place where the golden crest
 was with the wooden crest to exit out of the room.

 Go back to the dining room and put the golden crest where the
 wooden one was, the clock will chime and then move away
 showing a secret compartment behind it. Go over there and grab
 the Shield Key. Yay, no more annoying tick, tick, tick, from
 the clock. Now go out the main hall.


     // SHIELD KEY \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | The puzzle remains the same, the pieces are just    |
    | elsewhere and in a different order. First you need  |
    | to swap the Wooden Emblem for the Gold one from the |
    | Bar's secret room. Then put the Gold one in the     |
    | dining hall to get the Blue Jewel from behind the   |
    | clock, and take the Jewel to the Tiger Statue to    |
    | get the Shield Key from it.                         |

 3.2.6 - A Beast of Enormous Size
 --------------------------------


 *narrows eyes* I said beast. Geez, some people... ;p


 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Sun Crest
 Lighter
 Clip (x2)
 Red Herb
 Ink Ribbon (x2)
 Explosive Rounds
 Green Herb (x3)
 2nd Floor Map
 Serum
 Acid Rounds
 Moon Crest
 Shells

 Go up the stairs to the second floor. Go to the right of the
 main hall and into the U-Shaped hall. Go past the wooden door
 and unlock it with the Armor key, but don't go in. Now go
 around to the double green doors and enter them. Once inside
 the trick here is to cover up the vents with the large statues
 and then flick the switch, when that is done the case at the
 end will drop allowing you to get the Sun Crest. Now follow
 the hall around and go back to the area by the stairs above
 the save room where you got the chemical. Go past the stairs
 and unlock the first door on the right-hand wall.

 Once inside go to Jill's right, and enter the door there. You
 will find the lighter on the top of the bookshelf, a clip
 beside the right bed and right wall, and a red herb between
 the left bed and the left wall. Go back out and into the other
 room. In here check the jacket by the door for an ink ribbon,
 and the table for some notes. Go to the panel on the wall
 where it's broken and check it. The tank will empty and allow
 you to push it away from the wardrobe. Now you can push the
 wardrobe where the tank was and find the secret stash of
 explosive rounds.

 Go back out to the corridor with the stairs, but keep heading
 the direction you got to the previous rooms, and enter the
 blue door at the end. Inside will be a locked single red door,
 a green herb, and a fireplace. Check the fire and it will say:
 "Wood is put in the stove, A paper is on the wall." Use your
 lighter on the fire to get the 2nd floor map. Go back to the
 save room where you got the chemical, and put away everything
 except the lighter, shield key, and the bazooka with acid
 rounds (if you feel like it).

 Now go back to the U-shaped hall and go into the single wooden
 door you unlocked earlier. Grab the two green herbs once
 inside, then go around the corner.

 Scene:
 ------
 Jill comes across Richard Aiken, a member of Bravo Team. A
 large snake that's also poisonous has injured him. You have to
 go get the serum from the save room over by the greenhouse.

 When you regain control of Jill, after exiting the maps, head
 to the room, when you're there, search the shelves by the item
 box to get the serum. SAVE NOW!!!!! Now head back to Richard,
 and give him the serum.

 Scene:
 You give Richard the serum, and he gives you his radio, and
 then dies.

 Go into the door behind Richard. Move forward and kill the
 zombie, and follow the hall down behind where he was and enter
 the door where he was. You should be in a room with a table
 and two closets. The table has some candles on it, use the
 lighter on these to light up the room. There is a ink ribbon
 on the table, and a clip in the back closet by the pictures of
 planets and the clock. You can push the other closet away to
 reveal a passage with another closet at the end. Search this
 for some acid rounds.

 Go back to the area where you killed that last zombie, and go
 up the steps and use the shield key on the door then discard
 it. Go into the attic.

 Run forward once inside and you will be confronted by one huge
 ass snake. You have two options, get rid of it if you have the
 bazooka with acid rounds on you, or avoid it. No 1. Is easy to
 explain, hard to do. No 2. Is hard to explain, even harder to
 do. ":|

 No 1. Stand your ground and shoot it with acid until it runs
 off.

 No 2. Wait until it is halfway round the other side of the
 post from you and run.

 You're going for the hole where it came out from, to get the
 moon crest. On your way out, grab the shells sitting on some
 barrels in the middle of the left wall (the side with the exit
 door).


     // MOON CREST \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | When you grab the Moon Crest in the advanced game,  |
    | you'll be in for a bit of a surprise. It's only     |
    | half of the crest. Instead you'll need to track     |
    | down the remaining half of the crest in the mansion.|
    |                                                     |
    | The other half is hidden in one of the researchers  |
    | bedrooms on the 2nd floor of the mansion. To get it |
    | you'll need to empty a fish tank, and move it and a |
    | wardrobe to access a hidden cupboard with the other |
    | half of the crest inside.                           |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Once you exit and get down the steps something may happen.

 Variations:
 -----------
 If you didn't get bitten once, nothing will happen. Go to the
 save room where you got the chemical, And read the guide from
 the star (*) onwards.

 If you got bitten you will faint, and if you got saved by
 Barry, then he (I think it's him, it could be Wesker) will
 turn up, and you will awake in the save room where you got the
 serum.

 If you got bitten, but you got the shotgun yourself, you will
 have to go get the serum yourself.

 Once you have been cured, either all ready there, or having to
 get the serum yourself, go to the other save room where you
 got the chemical.

 --------------------------------
 3.2.7 - The Gate of New Life (*)
 --------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Star Crest
 Square Crank
 Red Herb (x2)
 Green Herb (x5)
 Blue Herb (x4)

 Leave the save room and head out the door at the end of the
 hall. Now go to the end of this hall, where the second zombie
 was and enter the door (You can't enter the other single door
 in the hall because it's locked).

 Once inside, you will hear crows. They wont attack unless you:

 - Get a switch wrong in here
 - Fire a shot.

 Now read the first painting. The title is "Give Me Peaceful
 Sleep." Now the paintings are in this order:

 1. A picture of a tired middle-aged man
 2. A picture of a newborn baby
 3. A picture of a young man
 4. A picture of a infant
 5. A picture of a lively boy
 6. A picture of a bold-looking old man.

 You have to put these in the correct order. That is:

 2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6,

 After pressing the last one, go to the last painting which
 says: "Give me the peace of death, and I'll give you the joy
 of life" Press the switch and the painting will fall giving
 you the Star Crest. Now go out of the gallery, and go straight
 ahead of the door, till you reach a metal door. Go out it.

 Shoot the dog in the passageway, and go to the end. There is a
 metal panel, which says: "When the sun sets in the west and
 the moon rises in the east, stars will begin to appear in the
 sky and wind will blow towards the ground. Then the gate of
 new life will open." Meaning you have got to put the four
 crests in the plate to open the door. Inside the next room are
 some steps that you push towards the camera a bit, then push
 towards the high shelf on the back wall. Climb up the steps
 and grab the square crank. Climb back down and go out the
 other door.

 You will find yourself outside, shoot the two dogs and get the
 herbs. There are two red herbs, three green herbs, and two
 blue herbs. If you hear a beeping sound that is your radio. Go
 into the status screen and select radio to use it and hear a
 message from Brad. Go down the left path to find the map of
 GARDEN, then go down the right path, and through the large
 rusted metal gate. Follow the path round the water and use the
 square crank on the box you find this will empty out the
 water.

 Go down the path that was in the water and up the other side.
 Run along the path, dodging the small snakes and hop on the
 lift down.

 When you get to the bottom kill the two dogs here. You will
 find a dead lift, with a hole in the wall for a battery. A
 waterfall, and another gate, Go through this other gate.

 There are two blue herbs and two green herbs but you can't
 pick them up until you have got rid of the dogs here. Once you
 have killed the three dogs and picked up the herbs follow the
 twisting passage until you come to a door.

 Helmet Key

 Move around the statue and grab the three blue herbs. Now move
 the statue down the hall until the next hall that leads off
 it. Push it up that one and cover the hole.

 Now that that is done, go into the single wooden door on the
 right side (the one without a metal panel above the door).
 Inside you will find an item box and typewriter, along with a
 First Aid Spray and some explosive rounds. Leave when you are
 ready and go across the hall to the other single wooden door.

 When inside forget about the door to Jill's left (for now),
 and kill the two zombies. Open the draw with the lock-pick to
 get some shells, pick up the red book on the bed. Now go into
 the other door. Unfill the bath by examining it. You will get
 the C. Room Key. Now go back out to the main hall.

    | The advanced game moves the Red Book from the bed   |
    | here to a table in the Bar/RecRoom at the end of    |
    | hallway outside. Not a major change.                |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 You can go in the double doors at the end. Inside is a bar,
 with a clip and an Ink ribbon, oh and um, two spiders.

 Go up the hall where you put the statue and go through the
 door. Go up the new hall to the first door.

 Go in the door, run across to the other side of the room (all
 the doors in here are locked) and beside the bees nest is a
 table with the 002 Dormitory Key on it.

 Take the key then sprint away from the bees. Go back out to
 the hall and down to the door at the end that you haven't been
 to (unless you did the Barry thing above). There is a statue
 you can push and behind it are three green herbs. Now go to
 the door. This is the 002 door so use the key. There is a door
 to Jill's left. All that's in there is a zombie and a clip. In
 the main room, check the draw for some shells, and get the map
 of the GUARDHOUSE off the wall. Now push the closets aside to
 find a ladder to the basement.

    | In the Advanced game, in the small bathroom with    |
    | the zombie and a clip, the clip is replaced with    |
    | the 003 Dorm Room Key. This greatly alters the game |

 Annoying Puzzle 1. Pushing the Crates to make a bridge.
 -------------------------------------------------------

 Run past the first crate we'll be back later for it. The first
 two are very straightforward. Just push them into the water.

 The third one though, is a pain. You have to push it away from
 the water direction, towards the ladder. When it's so far get
 it half way from the corner and push it to the left wall, now
 push it all the way down the corridor to the end and then push
 it in the water. If this is confusing for you, I made this map
 to show you where to go:


       ======================
       =                    == LADDER

 WATER    +     =
 C1 C2 ++++     =
 ================


 Once you have done that there are two green herbs to pick up.
 Now go through the water and through the door. WARNING: Go to
 the Jill's right, if you go to the Left it equals instant
 death.

 Run through the water until you get near two doors together.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 Oh no, something in the water and it's moving fast.

 Get to the left door before it gets you. You will use the C.
 Room Key, and discard it. Once inside flick the switch beside
 the Red flashing light. This will drain the water. Now go over
 to the switch by the door, this will unlock the door beside
 this one. Go out into the main room, you don't have to worry
 about the sharks anymore, they are high n' dry.

 Go in the door beside the control room. This is the weapons
 storage but most of the stuff in here is wet. There are two
 boxes of shells and two clips and the 003 dormitory key, Leave
 and go back upstairs and to the large hall with the bees, and
 use the 003 key on the single door without the keypad. Once
 inside go into the door on the left of Jill. Inside is another
 zombie and some flame rounds. Go back to the main room, inside
 the draw is an ink ribbon.

 Go to the bookshelf and take the white book. Now put in the
 red book, the other shelf will move away, showing a secret
 door. Note: It would be good to have the Bazooka with flame
 and explosive rounds for the next part, and some healing items
 as well. Saving the game might also help. When you are ready,
 go through the door.

 Inside is one extremely large plant, this is the Plant 42 that
 you have read about. Start shooting at it, but don't get too
 close because it will hit you with it's vines, and don't stay
 in the same place too long or part of the ceiling will fall on
 you.

 Scene:
 ------
 The plant will shrink to the ceiling, and Jill will go inspect
 it. The plant goes back to normal and picks Jill up. Barry
 comes in and toasts it with the flame-thrower. Jill thanks him
 for saving her and Barry questions the plant and the things
 happening.

 Go over to the fireplace and take the helmet key, then leave.

 Head back to the Guardhouse save room.

 Scene:
 ------
 When you get to the hall, you will hear firing. Jill will run
 around the corner and find Wesker killing some bees. That will
 talk and Wesker will tell Jill to go look at the rest of the
 mansion, then he leaves.

 Go to the save room and put away any unnecessary items away
 and save. Now leave the guardhouse; back out to the garden.

 ---------------------------------
 3.2.9 - The Guards of Destruction
 ---------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 Magnum Rounds (x3)
 Doom Book 1
 Eagle Medal (in Doom Book 1)
 Shells (x3)
 First Aid Spray
 Acid Rounds
 Green Herb (x5)
 Battery
 Explosive Rounds (x2)
 Blue Herb
 MoDisk
 Ink Ribbon
 Clip
 Red Jewel
 Colt Python

 Make your way across the garden, the same way you made it to
 the guardhouse, and into the mansion picking up any herbs you
 could not take the first time. When you get to the crest hall,
 where you put the four crests to unlock the door, equip the
 shotgun.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 When you go inside and get down the hall a bit this video
 takes place. Something sprints across the yard climbs up the
 elevator shaft, runs straight through to the door outside the
 mansion and opens it.

 Scene:
 ------
 You now see what it is.

 Shoot the "Hunter" with the shotgun, be careful that it does
 not jump. If you're still alive after that, well done you just
 killed one of the toughest common enemies in the game.
 However, there are many more to come. With the Helmet key you
 now have access to areas that were locked before, and the
 first one is the only locked door in the hall you are in.

 Once inside this dark room, go over to the desk and search it.
 It will tell you there is a switch, so push it. The room will
 light up. Grab the Magnum Rounds off the table, and the red
 book to the right of the door. This is the doom book 1. Go
 into the options, highlight the book, select it, and go to
 check, and check it. If you look at the cover it will say
 "nothing important" but it you check it when you have rotated
 the book so that the pages are facing the screen, the book
 will open up and you will find the eagle medal. Now go out of
 this room.

    | normally sits.                                      |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Head to the save room where you got the chemical. Outside, on
 the wall is a note telling you that there are some items left
 for you in the save room. Go into it. Inside on the floor are
 some shells, a first aid spray, and some acid rounds. Take
 them and get ready for another boss battle. Take the bazooka
 with acid rounds, the shotgun and shells and one red/green
 herb or first aid spray plus the helmet key. Now leave and go
 upstairs. Kill the hunters at the top, and go down the hall
 and into the room where the fireplace is and where you got the
 second floor map.

 Now unlock the single red door with the helmet key. Once
 inside go over to the piano and examine it, you will then be
 attacked.

 Scene:
 ------
 Out of the fireplace comes that darn snake again. He heads for
 you and tries to eat you. It misses and makes a hole in the
 floor, now it's time to kill it.

 Use the bazooka and acid rounds until it's dead, then go check
 the hole it made.

 Scene:
 ------
 Barry will come in and you will talk. He will give you a rope
 to climb down the hole with. When your at the bottom he drops
 the rope and goes off to get another.

 Wait for Barry to go get another rope. (**See other ending
 notes at the end of this walkthrough to see what to do here
 for other endings**)

 Scene:
 Barry will return and pull you back up. You talk and Barry
 apologizes, and gives you a pass number for something.

 You can now go back down the hole (You can also go through the
 house, but it means having to kill heaps of hunters-so go down
 the hole instead).

 When you are at the bottom, check the grave, and press the
 switch you find. This will move the grave and show a ladder.
 Climb down it. This next bit is confusing so I have drawn a
 map to show you where to go:

 ======================


 When you get down the ladder, kill the approaching zombie, but
 instead of going straight for the door, go around the corner
 and kill the zombie and take the shells, as shown on the map.

 Now go through the door. Follow the passage round until you
 find two zombies eating a corpse on the ground, kill them and
 take the two green herbs behind them. Now go through the other
 door in this hall and you will find yourself in the kitchen.
 Don't go up the stairs shown on the map, go kill the zombie on
 the floor, and take the lift.

 When you arrive at the top kill the zombie to Jill's right,
 and follow the hallway around, and go into the first door you
 see. Inside should be a battery and two lots of explosive
 rounds. Now go back out.


     // BATTERY #1 \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | The Battery is now located in the small hidden room |
    | off the library. For more details check the info    |
    | in the paragraph after the info on Doom Book #1.    |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 You can keep going the way you are heading but all that is
 out the other door is a long hallway with three zombies and
 two green herbs and a blue herb. Also the door at the end
 is locked. Go back past the lift and kill the zombie there.
 In the little nook beside the lift has a green herb. Go into
 the double blue doors.

 This is the library. Kill the zombie, and check the draw to
 the left of Jill. Inside is some magnum rounds. Go to the back
 of the room and kill the zombie there. Now go to the back
 single door and go through.

 Go between the shelves, using the gap right in front of the
 door, you will run into a statue. Push it forward until you
 can move around it. Now push it forward, towards the camera
 until the angle changes. Push the red button under the bust on
 the wall to shine a light to show you where to put the statue.

 When it's in place a secret part will open up. Search the desk
 there to get the MoDisk.

    | advanced game is the Doom Book #1. Check it as if   |
    | you were reading it to find the medal hidden inside.|
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back out to the main library. Up from where you got the
 magnum rounds out of the draw, is a bookshelf by itself, push
 it to find a secret door. Go through it. Inside will be an ink
 ribbon on the table, and a clip on the shelf. Go back out and
 go to the lift and take it back down. Now back in the kitchen,
 go around to the door leading to the stairs.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 A thing walking down the stairs and opening the door. What
 could it be!!!!

 Scene:
 ------
 Oh, no it's a, a...zombie. Wow, amazing, yay!

 Kill the stupid zombie, and go up the stairs. Follow the hall
 around to the double doors and unlock them. Go through. You
 will be in a hall that looks very familiar. Kill the hunters
 in here or run past them, and go to the save room where you
 got the serum from, killing any hunters in the way.

 When you get there put away any unnecessary items and only
 take the helmet key and your shotgun and shells. Go back out
 and up the stairs. Kill the hunter at the hallway at the top,
 and use the Helmet key on the door closest to the stairs (The
 other door has a keypad that you use the code that Barry gave
 you bit it only leads back to the Library and lift areas). Now
 discard the key.

 Once inside, you can grab the file on the table and the shells
 and the magnum rounds on the shelf beside the table. Push the
 steps forward so that they are underneath the deer head by the
 fireplace. Now go flick the switch by the door to make the
 room dark. Go over to the stairs and climb up them, face the
 deer and examine it. You will get the Red Jewel. Now head back
 to the Tiger Statue Room and use it on the statue to get the
 Colt Python. Time to kick some ass.


     // COLT AMMO \\______________________________________

    | As mentioned earlier when you received the Colt in  |
    | the advanced game, using the Red Jewel on the       |
    | statue gives you 3 lots of Colt ammo. Well worth    |
    | the effort still.                                   |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Note: don't waste all the ammo you get on the hunters. You're
 going to need it for other things. Now, head back to the save
 room where you got the chemical. The best way to do this is to
 go from the statue room, through the zombie hallway, through
 the dining room, across the main hall, through the little
 gallery, down the hall where the dogs went through the windows
 (there are two spiders in here but if you run they will drop
 from the ceiling after you go past), along the hall, shooting
 the hunter with the colt, and go back to the save room.

 Take the Colt Python and rounds, the square crank, and the
 battery with you. Go back outside killing the hunter in the
 crest path, across to where the small snakes are, and down the
 lift. Run over to where the other lift is, and put the battery
 in to use it. Get on the lift and ride it to the top. Once
 your up at the top, go down the path and go to the pool area
 where you drained the water. Use the crank on the device that
 opened the gate, to close it. Now the area will be full of
 water again. Go back to the lift you used to get here and go
 back down. You will find when you get to the bottom that the
 waterfall is gone and that there was a ladder behind it. Go
 down the ladder.

 3.2.10  - Traitors, Boulders, Spiders, what next?
 -------------------------------------------------

 Items In This Area:
 -------------------
 First Aid Spray (x2)
 Explosive Rounds
 Clip
 Hex. Crank
 Flame Rounds
 Ink Ribbon
 Blue Herb (x3)
 Map of Underground
 2nd MoDisk
 Doom Book 2
 Wolf Medal (inside Doom Book 2)
 Green Herb (x2)

 Go into the door on Jill's right.

 Scene:
 ------
 Barry will be standing in the entrance of this part. After
 talking to him you will be asked: "Will you go with him?
 Yes/No"

 Choose Yes, then he will talk a bit more, then you will be
 asked:

 "Do you want him to go first? Yes/No" choose yes again.

 He will talk once more then walk off. Move forward and you
 will hear gunshots.

 Go in the direction Barry went.

 Scene:
 ------
 Barry will kill a Hunter that attacks; then he will talk yet
 again.

 Go over to the machinery to find a First Aid Spray and some
 explosive rounds. Now go down the little passage that leads
 off the first room and go into the door there. Run down the
 hallway round the corner.

 Scene:
 ------
 A voice will call out for Jill. It's Enrico. They will talk,
 and Enrico will talk about a traitor in S.T.A.R.S. And that it
 was plotted by Umbrella. Then Enrico will be shot by a
 mysterious person and die.

 You can examine Enrico to get a clip. Go around the corner and
 pick up the Hex. Crank that is on the ground. Now go out the
 door. Kill the hunter that is on the screen and head to where
 it was standing and go out the door. Kill the hunter here and
 go out the door in the area where Barry was when you met him.


     // HEX. CRANK \\_____________________________________

    | Instead of lying on the ground like in the original,|
    | Enrico will be holding the Hex. Crank instead of    |
    | the clip.                                           |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now you are back where you started. Go down the hallway, and
 past a Typewriter (you can save if you have an ink ribbon).
 Now go around the corner and you will find you can't go any
 farther because there is a hole in the floor. Use the Hex.
 Crank on the panel in the wall so you can get past and go
 through the door at the end.

 Go around the corner to Jill's left and up to the large
 boulder that's there. Turn around and run away from it.

 Scene:
 That bolder starts moving after you. I know I've seen this
 somewhere before? But where? :)

 Keep running until you reach the door where you came in here.
 The bolder will smash a hole in the wall at the end, instead
 of crushing you. Go up to where the boulder was. When you do a
 hunter comes in, kill it and be happy. That was the last one
 of the game. You can start dancing now if you wish. When
 you're finished go and pick up the flame rounds in the little
 cubbyhole in the wall. Go to the area the boulder made in wall
 and go through the door with your colt ready. First there was
 the snake, then the plant, then the snake again, now it's the
 huge spider. Shoot it with your colt about six times and it
 should die. Watch your health carefully. When it's dead exit
 the room and come back in to get rid of the baby spiders. Grab
 the combat knife and cut away at the spider web to open the
 door.

 Go up the path to Jill's left and in the door. Great, a save
 room. Grab the ink ribbon, first aid spray, and the blue herb.
 Save. Heal. Take the eagle medal/doom book 1, Hex. Crank, and
 the colt and rounds. Go back out and down to the other end of
 the pathway, and through the door. You will be in a room with
 two paths. One has a lift at the end and the other leads to
 another passage. Take the one that leads to the other passage.

 Follow it until you can't go any farther because there is a
 hole in the ground, so use the hex. crank on the panel three
 times so that the hole is on the left wall. Run up to the
 boulder and do what you did the last time. Run into the hole
 in the left wall that we made by using the crank and wait for
 the boulder to go past. Go up to where the boulder was to get
 the map of UNDERGROUND and in the cubbyhole there is the 2nd
 MoDisk.

 Take the statue and move it to where the moving wall is. Now
 use the hex. crank on the crank hole once to move the statue
 out, and once again to move the wall back in. Push the statue
 to the pressure plate to open up the panel to get the Doom
 Book 2. Do the same thing that you did with the Doom Book 1 to
 get the Wolf medal.

    | Instead of the 2nd Doom Book being here (you would  |
    | have gotten it already), the Lab Key (or P. Room    |
    | Key will be hidden behind the panel).               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back to the passage with the lift and take it up to the
 garden. When you get to the top don't bother about the metal
 doors to Jill's left. They are welded shut. Go and pick up
 the two green herbs and the two blue herbs. Now go over to the
 fountain and use the eagle and wolf medals on the sides of the
 fountain. The Eagle medal on the left side and the wolf medal
 on the right side.

 CGI Video:

 The water empties out and a metal covering opens up while the
 outside of the fountain separates to make a path.

 Walk to the opening and down the steps. Get into the lift and
 ride it down.

 Green Herb (x4)
 3rd MoDisk
 Clip
 Slides
 Ink Ribbon (x2)
 Pass-code01
 Lab Key
 Shells
 Red Herbs
 Magnum Rounds
 Pass-code02
 Flame Rounds
 Blue Herb
 Pass-code03

 Walk around the corner. You can't get through the door yet so
 go down the ladder. Put away anything in the item box down
 here. Be sure to take the two MoDisks and your colt with you,
 then go out the door. There are two zombies and two green
 herbs here for you to get. Go around the corner away from the
 stairs, past the locked door and get the 3rd MoDisk off the
 table. Go back to the stairs and go down them.


     // BIODATA SLIDES \\_________________________________

    | Instead of the 3rd MODisc, you'll find the data     |
    | slides you can use in the Visual Data Room sitting  |
    | on the table instead.                               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Shoot the zombie there and go into the double doors to Jill's
 right. Now go into the single door on her left. Turn on the
 red switch, for some light. Go to the desk and pick up the
 file. Read it. You have to get the pass-code. So far you
 have: JOHN and ADA. This is the code in the file.


 =     =    = =    =    =     =
 ==   ==   =   =   ==   ==   ==
 = = = =    = =    = =  = = = =

 ==   ==    = =    =    =     =
 =     =   =   =   =    =     =


 This is the code that has to be worked out. On the painting
 on the other side is similar patterns, they are:


 By the Tree:
 ------------

 Now push the shelf aside to find a purple switch. This will
 change the writing on the painting to what it is. Which is

 TREE
 APPLE
 MAN
 WOMAN

 You take the symbols and swap them for letters and you get
 your final passcode - MOLE.

 JOHN, ADA, MOLE. These are the pass-codes. Before you leave
 take the green herb by the painting and the clip in the box
 by the sink.

 Head back out to the main room by the stairs, but this time
 go forward, to the left of the stairs. Run down the hall
 shooting any zombies in the way and go in the double doors at
 the end.


     // MODISC #2 \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | When you enter this lab in the advanced game, check |
    | the area at the back of the room to find the 2nd    |
    | MODisc sitting on the shelf.                        |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Once inside grab the slides lying on the floor, then go and
 use the computer. After all the computer start-up screens,
 you will be asked for the Login code: JOHN, then the
 password: ADA.

 You will then be asked which floor you would like to unlock,
 select B2, then enter the Password when prompted: MOLE.

 This will unlock B2. Now select B3 and it will unlock. Now
 select cancel to get out of the computer. Leave the room and
 go back to the hall outside John the researcher's room. Go
 down the hall and enter the only other single metal door.
 Kill the four zombies and check the boxes under the Excite!
 1998 poster for an ink ribbon. Now go over to the desk. On
 the desk is a pass-code output machine. Use one of the
 MoDisk's on it to get the Pass-code01. One down, two more to
 go.

 Leave and go upstairs and enter the double doors beside where
 you got the third MoDisk. Once inside use the slides on the
 projector to get some info on the monsters and other assorted
 stuff (Gee, THAT guy looks like Wesker, I wonder why???). Now
 go over to the panel on the wall, and open it; then press the
 button. The pillar on the wall will move across, showing a
 secret shelf. Search the shelf to find the lab key.


     // MODISC #3 \\______________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Instead of the Lab Key being hidden, you'll find    |
    | the 3rd and final MODisc here in the Advanced game. |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Go back downstairs, killing any zombies in the way, and go
 unlock the door with the red biohazard marking on the floor
 using the lab key, then discard it (the other double doors in
 this room are locked). Once you are through, go into the
 double doors on Jill's left. Inside is a medical lab, and
 this is the location of Annoying Puzzle No 3. Here is how to
 get past it:

 Annoying Puzzle No. 3 - The Box Trip.
 -------------------------------------

 This is how the room is when you enter it:


 ============================
 =          GG              =       KEY:
 =          GG              =	      H1 = VENT HOLE 1
 =                          =	      H2 = VENT HOLE 2
 =                          =	      D = DOOR
 =  H1        C2C2          =	      F = SHELF
 V       SSSS C2C2BBBBB     =       E = EQUIPMENT
 V  T    SSSS C1C1BBBBB     =       B = BED
 =            C1C1BBBBB     =	      C1 = CRATE 1
 =  H2            BBBBB     =	      C2 = CRATE 2
 =                BBBBB     =       S = STAIRS
 =   EEEE   EEEE            =	      T = TRIGGER
 =   EEEE   EEEE            =	      G = GRATE
 =                    FFFF  =	      V = VENT SHAFT
 =========DDDDDDDD===========


 1. First grab the shells off the bed and the red herb off the
    shelf.
 2. Move the steps up to where the grate is, but be sure there
    is enough room for you to walk right around it.
 3. Now move crate 2 over towards vent hole 1, but push it up
    once towards the grate then push it over vent hole 1 to
    make sure you have it over it.
 4. Now push crate 1 up to where crate 2 was, and push it out
    so that you can move right round it.
 5. Now push crate 1 down to the equipment, and then push it
    over the vent hole 2.
 6. Push crate 1 up once to make it cover vent hole 2 properly.
 7. Push the stairs back down to the gap where the trigger is.
    If done correctly the trigger will click, but no gas will
    come out.
 8. Climb up the steps and go through the vent shaft.

 This is what the room should be like after you have moved them
 around:


 ============================

 =                    FFFF  =	      V = VENT SHAFT
 =========DDDDDDDD===========


 Once you're out the other side, check the shelves to Jill's
 right for some magnum rounds. Run forward and use another
 MoDisk to get the pass-code02. Now leave through the double
 doors. You will be back out in the main hall bit. Kill the
 zombies here then go back through the door that you unlocked
 with the lab key. Run forward, taking out any zombies in your
 way and go into the single metal door straight ahead.

 The games last save room. In here to pick up are some flame
 rounds, a green herb and a blue herb, and an ink ribbon hidden
 to the left corner of the white shelf where the flame rounds
 are. Take your colt, and the last MoDisk, and a First Aid
 Spray/Red Green herb mixture. Leave and head down the hall
 outside. At one end is a lift that has no power, and at the
 other is the doors to the power room. Head to the power room.

 Now this is where it gets tricky. Head down the path to Jill's
 right, dodging any of the Chimeras in your way (don't shoot
 them, it's a waste of ammo). You should come to a power panel.
 Switch it on to power up all the levels. Now go back past the
 door where you came in, and go down one of the other paths as
 they all lead to the other door at the back.

 In this next room, run forward straight down the path to the
 last pass-code output machine. Use the last MoDisk on it to
 get the last pass-code, passcode03. Now head down the other
 path in this room that you went past and follow it to the next
 door. This room is free of monsters. Go to the left side of
 the machinery, there will be a monitor. This is the power
 connection switch. Turn it on to turn on the power for the
 lift.


     // BATTERY #2 \\_____________________________________
    |                                                     \
    | Unlike in the original where you find the Battery   |
    | needed for the end lift right beside it, the        |
    | Battery is located in this power room in the        |
    | advanced game.                                      |
    |                                                     |
    | If you walk around the room here you should find    |
    | the battery sitting on the floor somewhere near the |
    | back.                                               |
    |_____________________________________________________|


 Now go back through all that and go to the lift. Go to the
 right of the lift and push the switch there to power the lift.

 Nothing

 Scene:
 ------
 When you get to the top, you will come around the corner and
 be confronted by Wesker. Barry will hold his gun to your head.
 Wesker and Barry are the traitors. After listening to Wesker
 talk about the bio-weapons and that he is using Barry by
 threatening to kill his family, he plans to show you the
 tyrant. Barry comes back and knocks Wesker out cold. You then
 go into the lab, and see the tyrant.

 CGI Video:
 ----------
 The Tyrant in all its bio-weapon glory.

 Scene:
 ------
 Barry decides to destroy it. He pushes the keys on the panel,
 but this frees the Tyrant, and he attacks Barry. Now it's up
 to you to stop him, so get to it.

 Run around shooting him with the colt, until he collapses. Try
 not to get to close though. Go over to Barry.

 Scene:
 ------
 Jill finds that Barry is still alive, they talk then decide to
 leave.

 Go back to the lift.

 Scene:
 ------
 When you're out of the lab, Wesker isn't there any more. The
 alarm will sound and you will run for the lift and ride it
 down. Barry will run off ahead when you get to the bottom.

 Go to the save room and save, then go to the area by the
 bottom of the stairs on this level, killing anything in the
 way.

 Variation:
 ----------
 If you are going for the Good ending ignore the next part of
 the guide and join back at the #############. If you are going
 for the Good+ ending read on.

 Go into the double doors beside the stairs, past where John's
 room, past where you got the first pass-code, and to the
 double doors at the end with the panel beside it. Use the
 three pass-codes on the lock. Go through the door, and follow
 the hallway down to the next door.

 Video:
 ------
 Jill finds Chris and they talk.

 Go back to the main room.

 #############

 Go up the stairs. Kill the zombies and follow the hall around
 and through the door. Put away all weapons and items, and take
 all the first aid sprays/mixed herbs you have left. Fill your
 inventory with these, except for one slot, then climb up the
 ladder. Now you can enter the double doors.

 Brad will call on the radio.

 Follow the path around and pick up the battery, and use it in
 the hole to start the lift.

 Video:
 ------
 A timer for three minutes will count down, and who ever are
 with you will talk, then you will ride the lift.

 Now outside at the heliport, check the box to Jill's right for
 the flare. Move out to the middle and light the flare. The
 helicopter will come. Prepare for the final battle.

 Video:
 ------
 The tyrant will burst out of the ground and attack.

 Dodge the tyrant, by running around. He uses sprints and
 swipes of his claws. When there is 25-45 seconds left, Brad
 will drop the Rocket Launcher. Go pick it up, and shoot the
 Tyrant (be careful there is only four rockets).

 When you shoot him, watch him blow up in multi-views.
 Congratulations. You just finished Resident Evil.

 These are the conditions to get the endings:

 Good+ = Wait for Barry after he drops the rope.
         Save Chris by using the MODisc's.
 Good  = Wait for Barry after he drops the rope.
 Bad+  = Leave after Barry drops the rope.
         Save Chris by using the MODisc's.
 Bad   = Only save yourself.

 ---------------------------
 3.2.15  - How To Kill Barry
 ---------------------------

 To kill Barry is all dependent on your actions in the
 Underground. However keep in mind this is ONLY the case for
 killing him outright. To stop him from being killed overall
 you need to wait for him when he first drops the rope. If you
 want to kill him, don't wait for him then do the following:

 How to: Way #1

 1. When he first asks if you want to go with him, say no.
 2. Don't agree to stay there either.
 3. After he leaves properly, you'll hear shots. Don't follow
    him. Instead head the opposite direction and go see Enrico.
 4. When you arrive back at the entrance you'll find him dead.


 How to: Way #2

 1. When he first asks if you want to go with him, say yes.
 2. Tell him to take the lead.
 3. When he leaves and the shots are fired, don't follow,
    instead go the other direction to Enrico.
 4. Continue as normal. When you are near the finish of the
    game Barry won't return to deal with Wesker, instead he'll
    be near the Lab B2 Item box near death.


 How to: Way #3

 1. When he first asks if you want to go with him, say no.
 2. Agree to stay there.
 3. Barry leaves.
 4. Continue as normal. When you are near the finish of the
    game Barry won't return to deal with Wesker, instead he'll
    be near the Lab B2 Item box near death.

 3.3 - Changes/Comparisons/Scenes
 --------------------------------

 For those who don't want to go through the entire guide to
 find out the differences between the original modes and the
 advanced one, as well as scene changes in all versions, I
 present this small guide.


 3.3.1. - Costumes
 -----------------

 In the original Resident Evil, by completing the game with the
 best ending you were rewarded with the Special Key, which
 would allow you to unlock a bonus room with costumes (the only
 room you could possible leave unlocked in the mansion).

 With the Directors Cut edition, not only do your characters
 start off by wearing alternate costumes in the advanced mode,
 but the room which requires the Special Key is already
 unlocked, allowing you to go in and change costume.


 3.3.2. - Bonus Items/Secrets Changes
 ------------------------------------

 Completing the original game on PlayStation in under 3 hours
 rewarded you with the Rocket Launcher with Unlimited Ammo.
 Doing the same in the Advanced game will now instead give you
 the Colt Python with Unlimited ammo.


 3.3.3. - Item Location Changes QL

 3.3.4. - Scene Changes
 ----------------------

 In Resident Evil, your choices will lead to later scene
 changes. Some obvious, some not so obvious. Here is a list
 of the possible alterations you can make. If you can remember
 one I've managed to overlook, please e-mail me.

 // Chris Redfield

 1.  Returning to Wesker and Jill before investigating the
     gun shot.
 2.  Opening the door to the outside in the mansions main hall.
 3.  i.  Avoid going into the save room with Rebecca, instead
         getting access to the hall where Richard is. You'll
         find Rebecca here instead.
     ii. Doing this will change later scenes in the Piano
         Room and other scenes.
 4.  Choosing between letting Rebecca following you or not
     will change scenes here, as well as open later scenes
     in the guardhouse and the return to the mansion.
 5.  Telling Rebecca yes/no when she goes to play the Piano.
 6.  Getting (not) poisoned by the snake will change scenes.
 7.  Getting the Radio from Richard earlier or later will
     add or remove additional scenes.
 8.  Visiting Rebecca while in the Guardhouse will reveal
     some more of her character as well as some information
     on the maker of the products in the storeroom.
 9.  Depending on the earlier selections, Rebecca's encounter
     with the Hunter can take place in one of two different
     places.
 10. Staying and killing the hunter, or leaving and returning
     will have effects on scenes with Rebecca.
 11. Visiting Jill in the cells after getting all three pass
     codes but before heading to the B4 lab.
 12. Rescuing or not rescuing certain characters will reflect
     on scenes near and in the ending. (ie. the other endings)


 // Jill Valentine

 1.  Returning to Wesker before investigating the gunshot.
 2.  Wasting time instead of investigating the other rooms.
 3.  Opening the door to the outside in the mansions main hall.
 4.  Not getting the shotgun early will result in many
     changes.
     i.   Barry will be out on the balcony of the mansion
          with Forest and will give you the Bazooka.
     ii.  You'll find Barry destroying file evidence in the
          Researcher's room.
     iii. If you get poisoned by the snake you'll have to
          get the Serum yourself.
     iv.  When you reach the Guardhouse you'll find Barry
          talking to someone in one of the Room's. He
          brushes it off as talking to himself in his old
          age (There is more than this way of getting the
          scene).
     v.   You'll have to kill Plant 42 yourself.
 5.  Saving the serum for yourself by wasting time will
     remove later scenes with Richard. This will also change
     a scene later on where Barry will give you the Radio
     Richard was supposed to give you.
 7.  Getting poisoned by the Snake or not.
 8.  Using the V-Jolt on Plant 42 before going to fight it.
 9.  Sticking around for Barry or not after he drops the
     rope.
 10. Making various choices in the underground with Barry
     could reflect on your ending and various scene changes.
 11. Visiting Chris in the cells after getting all three pass
     codes but before heading to the B4 lab.
 12. Rescuing or not rescuing certain characters will reflect
     on scenes near and in the ending. (ie. the other endings)


 3.3.5. - Immediate Scene Changes Caused by Advanced Mode
 --------------------------------------------------------

 // Chris Redfield

 Because of the setup you can get the scene with Rebecca
 right at the start.

 This will also effect the scenes with the Radio.

 // Jill Valentine

 Somehow I always manage to get the scene with Barry in the
 Guardhouse in Advanced mode.

 ==============================================================

 -----------------------------
 4.0 - Sega Saturn Battle Mode
 -----------------------------

 Apart from the minor changes mentioned earlier on, the only
 thing that really makes the Sega Saturn version different is
 the Battle Mode within. If there is anything to compare it to
 of the mass released versions it would be the Battle Mode of
 Code Veronica (only here you have limited ammo). This doesn't
 surprise me as the Director of the Saturn edition and the
 Director of Code Veronica are one and the same.

 The Saturn version was the first RE game with a battle mode.
 To access it you would have to clear the game with a
 character. A clear game would open the option on the main
 manu. Of course there was also a cheat you could do with the
 second controller which would unlock it (you still needed a
 save file to be on the system though, but it could be a save
 anywhere in the game).

 The cheat is that at the title screen you hold X+Y+Z and
 press Start on a controller in control port #2.

 As I mentioned the battle mode is very similar to the one in
 Code Veronica except you had no 1st person and limited ammo.
 You'd start off in one of the games many save rooms with a
 selection of weapons and ammo in the trunk, along with some
 First Aid Sprays.

 Taking what you would want to use in the game and exiting
 you would now be 'transported' to a room in the game, with a
 few enemies in the same room. To exit a room, you had to
 kill ALL the enemies. You did 4 levels (4 different areas)
 then you'd be back in the save room to resupply yourself
 before you had to go back out and fight again.

 After you had finished all the rooms in the battle mode, in
 the last level you were then faced up against a 'special'
 gold colored Tyrant in the lab, that was really tough to
 kill. I ended up running out of ammo for all my strong
 weapons here usually, and would have to use the Handgun.
 Luckily, you always seem to have WAY too many bullets for
 the handgun, and you can never run out (unless you really
 sucked I guess).

 You'd get a rank after each game, depending on your ammo
 you have left, health, time, etc. The mode has been made
 infamous because there was also a special Wesker zombie,
 who was only in the Battle Mode. He was basically the
 same as a lab zombie (like those found in the room with
 him), but with Wesker's textures attached. He took like
 3-4 colt rounds before going down too... very powerful
 and there to waste your ammo.

 I've been asked many times if I think that the battle mode
 was a good addition and why the PlayStation never saw it.
 I think it was nice, but nothing amazing. I have little
 idea as to why it was never included in either of the two
 versions of Directors Cut that were released, it would
 have been worth the addition.

 Here for your enjoyment is a mini-guide to the battle mode
 giving suggestions on the items to take and strategy to
 use (Sadly this only covers Jill - I've long forgotten
 how I finished it with Chris). Don't be surprised if it
 takes you a few times to finish, the battle mode isn't
 supposed to be easy.


 // Save Room 1:

   ::Take::

  / WEAPONS:
    - Knife
    - Colt Python
    - Shotgun
    - Bazooka

  / AMMO
    - Magnum Rounds
    - Shells
    - Acid Rounds

  / HEALTH:
    - Fill Remaining Slots with First Aid Sprays.

 // Section 1:

 For the first area it's best to use the Shotgun on the
 three zombies in the hall here. Watch out for the one
 lying on the floor in the little part in the wall which
 normally leads to the Tiger Statue.

 // Section 2:

 Probably not the best thing in the world, but you can
 use the Shotgun on the Dogs. It can be very easily done
 with 1 shot kills if you have good timing.

 // Section 3:

 Fire off one shotgun shell (make sure you aim it at the
 crows to take a couple out with it to make things easier).
 This will get the rest down. Use the knife to kill them
 as they try to attack you. The easiest method here.

 // Section 4: BOSS 1 - YAWN

 Play it like the game, but use your starting point as an
 advantage. Grab your Bazooka w/Acid Rounds on use it on
 the snake. If you run out (which may happen if the shots
 don't connect) then use the Colt. If your good enough,
 you should be able to stand at the doorway and aim to
 the lower right and keep him away from biting you
 until it's dead.


 // Save Room 2:

   ::Take::

  / WEAPONS:
    - Colt Python
    - Bazooka

  / AMMO:
    - Magnum Rounds
    - Explosive Rounds
    - Flame Rounds

 /  HEALTH:
    - Fill the rest of the slots with First Aid Sprays

 // Section 1:

 Straightforward here, just use the Colt on the Spiders.
 This should be easy.

 // Section 2: BOSS 2 - PLANT 42

 Use the Bazooka on the Plant 42. Again, just like the
 game - watch out for its branches, and the ceiling. Use
 the flame rounds, then the explosive rounds if needed.

 // Section 3:

 Use the Colt on the Hunters. Make sure you keep them a
 good distance from them, otherwise you maybe cornered by
 them. Easy to handle with the right ideas.

 // Section 4: BOSS 3 - BLACK TIGER SPIDER

 Use the Colt on the Large Spider. Watch out for the
 poison spit. Shoot it from the side or back if you can,
 makes the job easier.


 // Save Room 3:

   ::Take::

  / WEAPONS:
    - All Remaining Weapons (Including Beretta)

  / AMMO
    - All Remaining Ammo (Including Clips)

  / HEALTH:
    - Fill what slots are left with First Aid Spray

 // Section 1:

 Kill all zombies with Colt for a quick clean out.
 Not very hard, however just remember the Wesker
 Zombie takes 3-4 Shots and should probably be left
 for last if possible.

 // Section 2:

 Kill Lab Monsters with Colt or Shotgun. Let them
 come close above you, back off facing them, and shoot
 upwards. Make your you try to keep them infront at
 all times. Letting them get behind you may lead to
 your death.

 // Section 3:

 Again, kill Lab Monsters with Colt or Shotgun. As
 before let them come close above you, back off
 facing them, and shoot upwards. Keep them in front.

 // Section 4:

 Now is the time to kill Super Gold Tyrant with
 whatever is left (Colt, Shotgun, Beretta). Just
 constantly circle the room shooting when there is
 distance, and moving as the Tyrant gets close.
 It may take a while to drop him, but he'll go
 eventually.

 5.0 - Full Items List/Location Guide
 ------------------------------------

 Here is the entire item list, with locations in both the
 original and advanced modes. Everything is listed here except
 for weapons (which had their own section before the main
 walkthrough), ink ribbons, and ammo (as they're all common
 items).

 / Armor Key

   Description: "A carving of armor."

   Information: During your various trips all around the
                mansions rooms, you will require the Armor
                Mansion Key to get into some new areas you've
                yet to explore.

   Location   : Resident Evil - Found in the Greenhouse of the
                mansion (1F that is) for both Jill and Chris
                you'll need to get past a plant to use it.
                Once gained you will have access to a large
                number of doorways. All doorways accessed will
                have the Armor etched below the keyhole
                according to your character.

                REDC - The key has been moved to an
                interesting place, outside with the dead Forest
                Speyer. Watch out though as when you go to pick
                it up, Forest will get up and attack. Once he
                is dead, you can finally go and pick it up.


 / Battery

   Description: "Now I can move the elevator."

   Information: It's kinda freaky to think that all your
                adventures till using this item were for doing
                so. It's true. Everything you do is to get you
                to where the Battery is held, so this is a very
                important item in Resident Evil.

                Here below is all the details that you will
                need on finding the two batteries in the game
                (the second one isn't so much of a problem
                 in the original), and which elevators they
                need to be used with.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The first Battery is found in a
                closet in on the 2nd Floor, near the library
                along with some ammo. This used in the middle
                of the courtyard to power the lift. The second
                is rather easy to locate, as it is sitting on
                the floor near where it is used, the escape
                lift to the Heliport.

                REDC - In the Directors Cut the first Battery
                is located near the same location, but has been
                moved to the hidden room off the Library. Be
                careful though as getting too close to the
                window will bring out some crows. The second
                Battery has been placed elsewhere also, this
                time in the Lab's Power Room on the B3 level.


 / Blue Jewel

   Description: "It's shining beautifully."

   Information: The tigers eye. If that doesn't give you a big
                clue as to where it is used, nothing else will.
                Unlike the Red Jewel, you'll need this to
                progress into the game. Here below is all the
                details that you will need on finding the Blue
                Jewel in the game, where exactly the Jewel is
                used, and what you get from using it.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The blue jewel isn't too hard
                to find. On the second floor of the dining room
                you'll find a statue holding the jewel. Push it
                over the balcony to the 1st floor and it will
                break, dropping the jewel on the floor. Once
                downstairs pick up the jewel and take it to the
                tiger statue room to get another item.

                REDC - This time you'll need to do a little
                more work to get the jewel. Once you've gained
                the golden crest put it in it's spot in the
                dining room. The clock will move aside
                revealing the space in the wall where you'll
                find the jewel. It needs to be used in the same
                place however.


 / Broken Shotgun

   Description: "It's too dangerous to fire! Dose it have
                 another use?"

   Information: Yes, the typo above is correct. The description
                is that way. As mentioned in the weapons
                section, the Broken Shotgun does have another
                use and that is to stop the trap you can
                trigger by taking the normal shotgun off the
                bracket. Below is where you will find the
                Broken Shotgun so you won't have to worry about
                setting the trap off.

   Location   : Resident Evil - Found on a shelf in a small
                room of the mansions 1st floor (west wing) the
                broken shotgun will allow you to get the normal
                shotgun without triggering a trap. This is
                needed for Chris as it's the only way he can
                get the shotgun. Jill can do it with or without
                it.

                REDC - This time getting the broken shotgun is
                a little easier. It's found on the floor in the
                eastern save room under the stairs to the 2nd
                floor. You only need to backtrack a few rooms
                to use it and get the shotgun.


 / Chemical

   Description: "A chemical to kill the weeds."

   Information: As the description says, this
                chemical/herbicide (clearly labeled "EARTH") is
                used to kill weeds. As for where those weeds
                are, well you'll figure that one out right
                away.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The chemical mixture is found on
                the floor in the eastern save room under the
                stairs to the 2nd floor. From here you'll have
                to walk over to the greenhouse to use it.

                REDC - This time getting finding the chemical
                just requires to move outside to the boiler
                behind the bathroom. The chemical is found
                sitting on the ground.



 / Control Room Key

   Description: "A key to enter the control room."

   Information: When you get to the Guardhouse of the Mansion
                grounds you'll find and also need this key to
                access areas inside. It's located in a kinda of
                odd place if you look at the details below.

   Location   : Resident Evil - Draining the bathtub in the
                bathroom of Dorm 001 of the guardhouse will
                gain you the control room key. Take this with
                you to the basement of the guardhouse and you
                can use it to access the control room.

                REDC - A bit of a change this time. You'll need
                to beat the Plant 42 and then check the
                fireplace for the Control Room Key.


 / Doom Book 1

   Description: "There was a medal in the book."

   Information: The info says it all. The main reason why you
                need the Doom Book 1 is to get the Medal out of
                it. Just where you will find the Doom Book
                though? Look below for that info.

   Location   : Resident Evil - When you return to the mansion
                from the guardhouse, the first door you'll open
                will lead to the study (top of the eastern
                wing, near where you enter/exit the mansion).
                Near the bookshelf you will find the doom book
                1, however you'll need to turn on the light
                switch from the desk first before you can
                actually pick it up. To use it, check it in
                your inventory, move it's pages into the main
                view as if you were going to open it to read,
                and click the action button. It should open up
                and display the medal for you.

                REDC - This time the doom book 1 is found in
                the hidden area at the rear library room on the
                western wing of the mansions 2nd floor. You
                need to solve a small puzzle to find it, but
                getting the medal out of it is the same as
                above.


 / Doom Book 2

   Description: "There was a medal in the book."

   Information: The info says it all. The main reason why you
                need the Doom Book 2 is to get the Medal out of
                it. Just where you will find the Doom Book
                though? Look below for that info.

   Location   : Resident Evil - After searching the
                underground, you'll come across a room with a
                small little pressure plate puzzle to open a
                wall panel. Inside the wall panel is the Doom
                Book 2. Once you have it, to use it, check it
                in your inventory, move it's pages into the
                main view as if you were going to open it to
                read, and click the action button. It should
                open up and display the medal for you.

                REDC - Not too much of a change. Outside the
                room mentioned for the original game and behind
                where the boulder is/was is a small space in
                the wall where the book will be sitting.


 / Dorm Key 002

   Description: "The number 002 is engraved."

   Information: To access the Dorm rooms in the mansions
                Guardhouse you'll need this key. The key only
                gains you access to the room with the 002
                nametag above the door.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - Found in the same location
                in both games, in the large room with the hive
                near a small table the key will be found. Be
                quick though as wasps will start to come out
                after a while. The key is then used to open the
                002 dorm back out in the hallway.


 / Dorm Key 003

   Description: "The number 003 is engraved."

   Information: To access the Dorm rooms in the mansions
                Guardhouse you'll need this key. The key only
                gains you access to the room with the 003
                nametag above the door.

   Location   : Resident Evil - Once you've accessed the
                guardhouse armory through the control room next
                door you'll find ammo along with the 003 dorm
                key on a shelf on the rear right of the room.
                Go back upstairs and unlock the 003 dorm room
                with the key.

                REDC - Go into the bathroom of the 002 dorm
                room and kill any enemies. Check the sink to
                find the 003 dorm room key.


 / Emblem

   Description: "There's a scratch. Someone may have used it."

   Information: This should be the first item in the game you
                actually see (unless your playing the DC
                Advanced game), though you won't need it until
                a little later on.

   Location   : Resident Evil - On the back wall of the first
                floor of the mansions dining room you'll find
                the emblem. By picking it up you need to use it
                to replace another emblem which in turn will
                replace this one.

                REDC - Same idea except the original location
                of the first emblem has changed. It's now in
                the armor gallery on the mansions 2nd floor.
                You'll need to solve a gas puzzle to drop the
                gate to grab it.


 / Flare

   Description: "I can signal Brad with this."

   Information: Finding and using this signal flare shouldn't
                be too hard to do for most people. Just in case
                though.... :)

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - The last item of the game
                is easy to find and easy to use. Sitting in a
                crate by the lift, grab it, and use it. That's
                all you need to do.


 / Gold Emblem

   Description: "There's a scratch. Someone may have used it."

   Information: Switch forth, switch back. The emblems puzzles
                are standard Capcom stuff. You might want to
                know more on where the Gold Emblem fits into
                things by reading below.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - After opening the secret
                room in the bar you'll find the gold emblem
                sitting in a statue. By picking it up you'll be
                stuck inside, and you'll need to replace it
                another emblem. Once that is done take the gold
                emblem and use it in the dining room.


 / Helmet Key

   Description: "A carving of a helmet."

   Information: During your various trips all around the
                mansions rooms, you will require the Helmet
                Mansion Key to get into some new areas you've
                yet to explore.

   Location   : Resident Evil - You'll need to beat the Plant
                42 in the guardhouse and then check the
                fireplace for the helmet key. This key unlocks
                the remaining doors in the mansion.

                REDC - Once you've accessed the guardhouse
                armory through the control room next door
                you'll find ammo along with the helmet key on a
                shelf on the rear right of the room.


 / Hex. Crank

   Description: "It's end is hex.-shaped."

   Information: Needed to explore areas of the Underground, the
                crank opens paths and secret areas by using it
                on panels in the walls of the areas
                underground.

   Location   : Resident Evil - After the death of Enrico, run
                along the corridors until the low angle screen
                shows you the crank sitting on the ground. It's
                not hard to miss as long as you're taking
                notice of the screen. This will now allow you
                to continue through the underground areas.

                REDC - Probably changed because a lot of people
                missed it, Enrico now holds the hex. crank.
                Check him and you'll be told he is holding
                something.


 / Lighter

   Description: "Some fluid is left."

   Information: Using the lighter which you can find can access
                you an extra area along with getting you a
                mansion map.

   Location   : Resident Evil/RE - Same place in both games. In
                one of the researchers bedrooms on the 2nd
                floor, the top of a shelf holds the lighter.
                The main point of having the lighter is to get
                extra ammo, a key, or the 2nd floor map.


 / Master Key

   Description: "It's specially coated and looks important..."

   Information: Dependent on your actions, you may or may not
                get this key. When you do get this key it has a
                range of real uses in the door opening
                selection, allowing you to access high security
                doors and exits.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - Depending on your choices
                you might get this key off Wesker. This will
                allow you to open the cell door (not the
                passcode one but the door into the actual cell)
                and the emergency escape door which leads to
                the heliport.


 / MO Disk

   Description: "It seems to be a start-up disk."

   Information: The three MO Disk's you can find in Resident
                Evil have an important part to your ending.
                These disks allow you to get passwords to open
                a locked door to rescue your opposite character
                (for Jill you rescue Chris and for Chris you
                 rescue Jill). This section is long as for each
                of the 3 disks is 3 password devices, along
                with this, the location of the disks has
                changed for the REDC edition. Stick with me on
                this as I try to show you where to go.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The three locations of the MO
                disks in Resident Evil is as follows:

                - The hidden area in the rear library on the
                  2nd floor of the mansion.
                - The small storage area behind the 2nd bolder
                  in the underground.
                - The desk outside the Visual Data Room, Lab
                  B2.

                And the three passcode output machines are
                found at:

                - Small Library, Lab B3.
                - Morgue, Lab B3.
                - Mid Power Room, Lab B3.

                REDC - While the passcode machines haven't
                moved the MO disks have. Here are the three new
                locations:

                - Book shelf in the Study of the 1st floor of
                  the mansion.
                - Hidden shelf in the Visual Data Room, Lab B2.
                - Low shelf in the small lab area, Lab B3.


 / Moon Crest

   Description: "A carving of the moon."

   Information: One of the back door crests that give you
                access to other areas outside the mansion, the
                Moon Crest (along with the other 3 crests) is
                an important item to the start of the game.

                To make things worse in the REDC edition, the
                Moon Crest is found in two halves, which you
                will need to collect and put together before
                using.

   Location   : Resident Evil - When faced with the large snake
                you need to run to the hole in which it used to
                enter the attic. On the ground you will find
                the whole moon crest. This needs to be used to
                unlock the rear door out to the courtyard.

                REDC - There is two pieces of the moon crest to
                find now. One in the original place, another in
                a hidden spot in one of the researchers
                bedrooms on the mansions 2nd floor. You'll need
                to find a way of accessing the hidden area
                shown the bottom picture on the right. Once you
                have both use the combine command to put it
                together to use.


 / Music Notes

   Description: "The title is "Moonlight Sonata."

   Information: What would we need with Music Notes in Resident
                Evil you might ask if you've never played
                before. Well in the game they are part of a
                puzzle which you need to solve.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - Not too hard to find. The
                music notes are hidden behind a pushable shelf
                in the bar/lounge room where they need to be
                used on the piano. They gain access to a hidden
                area however Chris will require some help from
                Rebecca before he can get inside.


 / Power Room Key

   Description: "A strange mark is carved here."

   Information: The Power Room Key (or Lab Key as you will
                originally know it as) give you access to new
                areas in the lab along with of course the Power
                Room.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The power room key is found in
                the hidden shelf in the Visual Data Room.
                You'll need to lower a panel and flick a switch
                to open the area. The key is used on the B3
                level to access the other half of the lab.

                REDC - Oddly placed, the key is found in the
                underground's pressure plate puzzle room.
                You'll need to solve the puzzle before you can
                pick up the key.


 / Red Book

   Description: "All pages are blank. What's it for...?"

   Information: Found in the Guardhouse this red covered blank
                page book has an odd use of unlocking a door.
                Can you figure out how?

   Location   : Resident Evil - The red book is found sitting
                on the bed in the 001 dorm room of the mansions
                guardhouse. It needs to be placed in a bookcase
                in the 003 dorm room.

                REDC - A small change in location puts the book
                on one of the tables in the guardhouses
                bar/rec. room. Watch out for the spiders
                though.


 / Red Jewel

   Description: "It's shining beautifully."

   Information: The tigers eye. If that doesn't give you a big
                clue as to where it is used, nothing else will.
                Unlike the Blue Jewel, you'll don't need this
                to progress into the game, though it's reward
                for doing so is great.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - Found in a small sitting
                room on the west side of the mansions 2nd
                floor, you'll need to pull it out of one of the
                stuffed animals after you've turned out the
                lights. Take it to the tiger statue for a
                reward. :)


 / Serum

   Description: "Only one dose is left."

   Information: The serum is used for the snake wounds
                inflicted upon a character from the large Yawn
                snake. The question is who will be using it?
                Your character or someone else? Or will you
                have to get more?

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - When needed you'll be able
                to pick up the serum off the shelf in the
                western save room on the mansions 1st floor.
                You can either use it for yourself or one of
                your team mates depending on your actions.


 / Shield Key

   Description: "A carving of a shield."

   Information: During your various trips all around the
                mansions rooms, you will require the Shield
                Mansion Key to get into some new areas you've
                yet to explore.

   Location   : Resident Evil - Originally this key is found
                behind the dining room clock after you use the
                gold emblem. The shield key allows you to
                access the attic.

                REDC - For the re-release the key has been
                moved behind the tiger statue. You'll need the
                blue jewel to access it.


 / Slides

   Description: "It seems to be some kind of research report."

   Information: Down in the lab you will find this slide cart.
                What is on it you ask? Well look below to where
                you will find it and what is on it.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The slides are found on the
                floor of the small lab on the B3 level of the
                lab. To view the slide cartridge take it to the
                Visual Data Room on the B2 level and use it on
                the slide machine.

                REDC - This time taking the slides to the room
                isn't such a big task as they are sitting on
                the desk outside the Visual Data Room.


 / Small Key

   Description: "A desk key."

   Information: While Jill is lucky to have the ability to pick
                locks with a lockpick she carries which takes
                up no space at all, Chris has to pick up and
                carry keys to unlock desks for ammo. Below you
                will find out where each of these keys is
                located and where they are used.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - I didn't double check
                this, but as far as I recall the small keys
                found in the original are in the same places as
                in the Directors Cut editions (correct me by
                e-mail if I am wrong about that). Those places
                are:

                - Shelf in passage to outside on the mansion's
                  2nd floor.
                - Bathroom bathtub, mansion 1st floor.
                - Barrels in the shed, mansion 1st floor.
                - Paper cup in Dorm Room 001, Guardhouse 1st
                  floor.
                - Crate in meeting room, guardhouse B1.
                - Basement kitchen, Mansion B1.

                These keys will access various desks that Jill
                uses lockpicks for. Most contain shotgun and
                magnum ammo.


 / Special Key

   Description: "There must be a closet somewhere."

   Information: When you finish a characters game with the best
                ending possible you will be rewarded with the
                Special Closet Key. Just where is this room?
                It's the only room you couldn't access in the
                original time through the game.

   Location   : Resident Evil - By beating the game with the
                best ending you'll gain this key. The key will
                access the one area in the mansion you couldn't
                get into which has changes of clothing for your
                character. In the advanced game for Resident
                Evil Directors Cut you don't need this key as
                the door is already unlocked.


 / Square Crank

   Description: "It's end is square-shaped."

   Information: Found just before the garden section of the
                Mansion grounds, the Square Crank allows you to
                continue your progress of moving through the
                mansion grounds.

   Location   : Resident Evil/REDC - Found in the small garden
                shed before the courtyard you'll need to push
                the steps up to the high shelf to grab it. You
                will use it in the courtyard to drain the water
                out of the path you need to cross.


 / Star Crest

   Description: "A carving of the star."

   Information: One of the back door crests that give you
                access to other areas outside the mansion, the
                Star Crest (along with the other 3 crests) is
                an important item to the start of the game.

   Location   : Resident Evil - To get the star crest you'll
                need to go to the art gallery in the mansions
                first floor. You'll need to solve a puzzle
                which will drop the last painting to reveal the
                crest which can be used on the lock at the back
                of the mansion.

                REDC - The star crest has been moved to the
                breakable statue on the dining room on the 2nd
                floor. Push it over the side and collect the
                crest from off the floor.


 / Sun Crest

   Description: "A carving of the sun."

   Information: One of the back door crests that give you
                access to other areas outside the mansion, the
                Sun Crest (along with the other 3 crests) is an
                important item to the start of the game.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The sun crest is found in the
                armor gallery on the mansions 2nd floor. You'll
                need to solve a gas puzzle to drop the gate to
                grab it from his holding place.

                REDC - The sun crest is found behind the plant
                and fountain on the wall mounting. You'll need
                to get past the plant first to get it however.


 / Sword Key

   Description: "A carving of a sword."

   Information: During your various trips all around the
                mansions rooms, you will require the Sword
                Mansion Key to get into some new areas you've
                yet to explore. Chris is the only person to
                receive the key as Jill has the lockpick.

   Location   : Resident Evil - As mentioned, the only mansion
                key Chris gets that Jill doesn't (Jill uses her
                lockpick for Sword Key doors). Found on the bed
                in the western save room the key unlocks some
                general doorways.

                REDC - In the re-release you'll find the Sword
                Key upstairs in the small dining room near the
                attic. You'll need the lighter first though
                because the room needs to be lit up by the
                candles and the shelf moved to access the small
                back room before you can get it.


 / V-Jolt

   Description: "Now I can destroy that ivy monster"

   Information: This (after all the mixing which is outlined
                below) is what you need from the various other
                chemicals found in the store house. From using
                the Empty Bottles (look at the page for it if
                you need to know more about how to start making
                the V-Jolt) you can mix the various chemicals
                outlined to make this. When your finished take
                it to the basement and use it on the roots.

   Location   : You'll find the chemicals and bottles to make
                the V-Jolt in the chemical room in the
                Guardhouse. The combination for the lock is 215
                for Chris/Rebecca and 345 for Jill.


 / Wind Crest

   Description: "It represents wind."

   Information: One of the back door crests that give you
                access to other areas outside the mansion, the
                Wind Crest (along with the other 3 crests) is
                an important item to the start of the game.

   Location   : Resident Evil - The wind crest is found behind
                the tiger statue. To gain it you will need the
                blue jewel. Once you do you can use it to
                unlock the back door and get out to the
                courtyard.

                REDC - The wind crest now takes the place of
                the star crest, it is located behind to the
                last painting in the art gallery. You'll need
                to solve a small puzzle to gain it.

 ~ About Medicinal Herbs ~

 As you may know there are many plants that have medical
 effects. Since ancient times, humans have been healing wounds
 and diseases using various plants.

 In this book, we're going to sample three herbs that grow
 around the Raccoon Mountains and give examples of those plants
 with medical properties.

 Each herb has a different colour and different effects as
 medical plants: the green one recovers physical strength, the
 blue one neutralizes natural toxins while the red herb does
 not have any effect by itself. The red herb is only effective
 when it is mixed with the other herbs.

 For example, if you mix the red with the green, you will get
 recovery tripled. By adjusting the amount and experimenting
 with these three herbs, you can create various kinds of
 medicines but I'll leave the details to you because that's the
 best way to acquire knowledge

 6.2. - Keeper's Diary
 ---------------------

 May 9, 1998

 At night, I played poker with Scott the guard, Alias, and
 Steve the Researcher.

 Steve was really lucky, but I think he was cheating. What a
 scumbag.


 May 10, 1998

 Today, a high-ranking researcher asked me to take care of a
 new monster. It looks like a gorilla without any skin. They
 told me to feed them live food. When I threw in a pig they
 were playing with it... pulling off its legs and pulling out
 its guts before they actually ate it.


 May 11, 1998

 Around 5 'o clock this morning, Scott came in and woke me up
 suddenly. He was wearing a protection suit that looks a space
 suit.

 He told me to put one on as well. I heard that there was an
 accident in the basement lab. It's no wonder; those
 researchers never rest even at night.


 May 12, 1998

 I've been wearing this damn spacesuit since yesterday; my skin
 grows musty and feels very itchy. By way of revenge, I didn't
 feed those dogs today. Now I feel better.


 May 13, 1998

 I went to the medical room because my back is all swollen and
 itchy. They put a big bandage on my back and told me that I
 don't have to wear the spacesuit anymore. I guess I can sleep
 well tonight.


 May 14, 1998

 When I woke up this morning, I found another blister on my
 foot. I went to the dog's pen and ended up dragging my foot.
 They have been quiet since morning, which is unusual. I found
 that some of them had escaped. I'll be in real trouble if the
 higher ups find out.


 May 15, 1998

 Even though I didn't feel well, I decided to go see Nancy.
 It's my first day off in a long time, but I was stopped by the
 guard on the way out. They say the company has ordered that no
 one leave the grounds. I can't even make a phone call what
 kind of joke is this!?!


 May 16, 1998

 I heard a researcher that tried to escape was shot last night.
 My entire body feels burning and itchy at night. When I was
 scratching the swelling on my arm a lump of rotten flesh
 dropped off. What the hell is happening to me?


 May 19, 1998

 Fever gone but itchy.
 Hungry and eat doggy food.
 Itchy. Itchy. Scott came. Ugly face so killed him.
 Tasty.


 4.
 Itchy.
 Tasty.

 6.3. - Researchers Will
 -----------------------

 My dear Alma,

 The fact that you have received this letter is both a joy and
 sadness for me. I could not even talk to you because of that
 guy in the sunglasses. Alma, be calm and read this.

 I think I told you that I moved to a pharmaceutical company's
 lab. They headhunted me. Last month, there was an accident in
 the lab and the virus we were studying escaped.

 All my colleagues who were infected by the virus are dead. To
 be accurate; they've become the living dead. They still wonder
 around. Some of them are knocking at my door desperately right
 now, but there is no sign of intelligence behind those eyes.

 That cursed virus takes away all humanity from the human
 brain. Love, joy, sorrow, fear, and humor... eternally.

 And Alma, even the memories of the days I spent with you...
 yes, I'm infected. I did everything to delay it, but I could
 only for a few days. The most frightening thing is I forget
 more about you by the day.

 So I chose a peaceful death, rather than becoming one of the
 living dead. Within an hour, I will have entered my eternal
 sleep. I hope you will understand my decision...

 Goodbye and forever yours,

                      Martin Crackhorn

 6.6. - Plant 42 Report
 ----------------------

 Four days have passed since the accident and the plant at
 point 42 is growing amazingly fast.

 It has been affected by the T-Virus differently than other
 plants have been and shows unique shape in addition to size.
 Looking at the way it behaves it is difficult to determine
 what kind of plant it was originally.

 There are two ways in which plant 42 gathers nutrition. The
 first one is through its root that reaches into the basement.

 Immediately after the accident, a scientist went mad and broke
 the  water tank in the basement. Now the basement is filled
 with muddy water. It is easily imaginable that some chemical
 elements were blended in the water and promotes the incredibly
 fast growth of plant 42.

 Another part of plant 42 from the basement grows through the
 duct and hangs down like so many bulbs from the ceiling of the
 first floor. Many vines come out of these bulbs and they are
 the second source of its nutrition.

 Once senceing movement, plant 42 shoots its vines around the
 prey and holds it. Then it starts sucking blood, using the
 suckers located at the back of its vine.

 It also has some intelligence. It blocks the door by twining
 its vines around it especially when it captures prey or is
 sleeping.

 Several staff members have already fallen victims to this.

 To: General Manager of Sanitation Division

 From: Special Committee on Disasters Raccoon Special Research
       Dept.

 This memorandum is strictly confidential and must be destroyed
 as soon as it is understood.

 Regarding the "T-Virus" outbreak, which occurred recently.
 This committee conducted a field survey. According to the
 survey results estimates on the amount of damage caused by the
 accident are considerably greater than reported earlier.

 Second, our security system is still in operation. However,
 our special security guard squad has nearly been destroyed.
 Because of that research information considered by our company
 to be Top Secret has been made available to outsiders.
 Counter-measures should be taken as soon as possible.

 Finally, many of the "Subjects" from the experiments have
 escaped and are out of control. We believe that some
 researchers were killed by these "Subjects" and their body's
 mutilated.

 By curious coincidence these events are proof of the success
 of our research. However there is also a very high risk that
 this news will be leaked to the press if we don't act
 immediately.

 The condition is very serious. Our operation to cover up the
 situation is difficult to attain, however we hope the problem
 will be solved quickly. We are especially concerned that the
 state police and S.T.A.R.S. are intervening to quickly. We
 need to act on this situation as well.

 ANIMAL ATTACK? WOMAN MUTILATED

 May 20. Around 10pm a 20-year old woman's body was found by a
 passer-by on the left bank of the Marble River in the Cider
 district of Raccoon City.

 Raccoon Police assume it to be a grizzly or other animals
 doing as there are teeth marks along her mutilated arms and
 left foot that show considerable power. Since she was wearing
 a hiking boot on her other foot it has been determined that
 she was attacked in the Arklay Mountains and fell into the
 river. They are hurrying to identify this woman.


 RACCOON WEEKLY JUNE 16, 1998
 MONSTERS IN ARKLAY MOUNTAINS?

 Some people claim to have seen monsters in the Arklay
 Mountains. The monsters are supposedly dog size and run in
 packs like wolves do. This may sound like a pack of ordinary
 wild dogs, but these are surpassingly fierce and hard to hurt.

 They say these dogs wont bother you unless you wake them while
 they are sleeping. So you smart readers should stay out of the
 Arklay Mountains for the time being. But if you're looking for
 adventure, check it out! You wanna try?

 MYSTERY ON ARKLAY MOUNTAINS

  -Mountain Road Blocked-

 Due to the successive disasters in the Arklay Mountains, the
 city authorities have decided to block the road leading to the
 foothills.

 At the same time, Raccoon Police intend to search for lost
 people with the help of S.T.A.R.S. team members. They expect
 great difficulty because of the vast size of the Arklay
 Mountains and the primeval forest that covers most of the
 area. Also people are still reporting sightings of grotesque
 monsters in the mountains.

 Dear Ada,

 Ada, by the time you read this I'll be something... different.

 Today's test turned out to be positive, just as I had
 expected. I feel crazy when I think about becoming one of
 them. Ada, your not infected and I hope you never will be. In
 case you're the only one left, take the material to the Visual
 Data Room and go to the Power room to operate the Triggering
 System before you escape.

 Make all this public through the media. If everything is in
 order, all the locks can be opened by the security system. You
 can access the system if you log in with my name, from the
 terminal in the small lab and enter the password.

 The password is your name.

 To unlock the door at 132 where the Visual Data Room is
 located, you'll need to access with our names first then enter
 another password.

 I've written the code below, I'm sure you'll understand it
 easily.

 And this is my last hope - if you find me completely changed
 please kill me yourself.

 6.11. - "V-Jolt" Report
 -----------------------

 As I stated in the last report there are some common features
 found in the cells of the plant infected with the Tyrant
 Virus. We have also found another interesting fact through
 some experiments.

 We found an element that destroys these plant cells rapidly in
 "UMB. No. 16" one of the series of Umbrella Chemicals that we
 used for the experiment.

 We named this "UMB. No. 16" as "V-Jolt." In our calculations,
 it will take less than 5 seconds to destroy plant 42 if we put
 the "V-Jolt" directly on the root.

 You need to mix some of the UMB series chemicals in an order
 to make the "V-Jolt." But the UMB. Series of chemicals may
 generate a poisonous gas, which is harmful to the human body.
 Extreme caution should be taken when handling these chemicals.

 Following are the types of UMB. Chemicals and their brief
 characteristics:

 UMB. No. 2 Red
 NP-OO3 Purple
 UMB. No. 4 Green
 Yellow-6 Yellow
 UMB. No. 7 White
 UMB. No. 13 Blue (Stimulating Smell)

 9.0 - Review
 -------------

 I'm chucking this review in at the end. I don't know why. Just
 did.

 I assume if your an RE fan reading this guide wont be
 interested in a review on the game that started it all,
 probably because you've already played it. Well, perhaps not.
 Although it's common for a lot of newbies to the RE world to
 have played later games before the original and usually it
 means they say that RE #X was the best one and that RE1 really
 sucks. For me the first is the best I still can't get past how
 much the original impressed me the first time I played it, and
 the numerous times I played it afterwards also.

 Capcom at the time really out did themselves with what they
 coined as Survival Horror. Although the voice acting wasn't
 the best it gave the atmosphere that you were playing a
 shocking B grade horror, which of course makes those sort of
 things more entertaining.

 The general shock value is majorly apparent even to these
 days, many people explaining the scene with the dogs jumping
 through the window causing them to have various reactions from
 jumping out of their seat to shitting themselves with fear
 (excuse the expletive, but it's probably true). A shock value
 which many people like indeed.

 The thing that got people hooked, and like many games, was the
 story behind the game. I know it was something which got me
 interested in completing the game. You weren't just there to
 shoot the crap out of stuff, while that was fun in itself, the
 story was always there to back it up. What was causing the
 various killings at first and then what was causing the
 various monsters, and as you worked through the game you'd
 discover the facts behind the evil within the mansion.

 Graphically the game was nice. Compared these days to both
 later sequels and other games you may cringe to see some
 parts, but the pre-rendered backgrounds gave high detail while
 the polygon models gave a high depth. The sound effects and
 music were a complete difference when compared to the voice
 acting. High suited scores and independent sound effects made
 playing the game a treat in the sound department.

 Although if there is one thing complained about more often
 than not its the controls. I've never had any problems with
 the use of the controls, and after a few minutes practice they
 became as common to me as any other game. At first it felt
 weird to be holding one button to lift the gun and one to
 shoot with, and the controls ended up with me walking or
 running into or along walls. To this day I can say sometimes I
 do get caught up on things when running, but all and all no
 one should have no trouble with it after some practice.

 If there is one other thing that I could say about RE's bad
 side that would be the puzzles. You can get through the game
 with no trouble in this department at all. Most of them
 involve you pushing things around which becomes very tedious,
 and only a couple require any brain work when it comes to
 creating the answer or having things pushed in the right
 locations so you can solve the puzzle. I remember having a pen
 and paper ready for the first time I played it, but they
 didn't get used.

 People tend to ask me if I think Resident Evil has replay
 value, and I can never give them an answer. I can't say it has
 anything of value to cause you to do so, but some people like
 myself, never seem to mind cranking it out again and giving it
 a shot. Perhaps because you can find some fun to play it
 again. Sometimes using the Rocket Launcher isn't enough
 though, and I tend to be reaching for my GameShark to spice
 things up. Of course should you want to see all 8 endings of
 the game you have a great excuse to play the game over and
 over again, and you'll find you may even come across new
 scenes should you do smoothing differently, and for this I
 guess you could say it has a small amount of replay value.
 Even in the hundredth reply sometime in mid 1997 I would come
 across a new scene I'd never seen before.

 When thinking about the game I can go to the fact that your
 not always going to be happy with some features, such as the
 easy puzzles and various other niggles. There are points which
 become beyond funny and make no sense when you get down to it,
 but I can't take away from the fact that the game is still a
 great purchase, and worthy of any games collection. It is my
 favorite of the series and nothing will probably change that,
 all I can say is if your a fan and yet to play it go out and
 get it now.
