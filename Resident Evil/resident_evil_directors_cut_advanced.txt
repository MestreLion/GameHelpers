1. REVISION HISTORY
=====================================================================

Version 1.0 [7-10-2000]
First version. Very few things.

Version 1.1 [7-12-2000]
Made the "Weapon and Ammo" and "Monsters" sections. Made the first
three maps. Corrected some mistakes.

Version 1.2 [7-14-2000]
More maps, Jill's walkthrough up to the second snake battle, some
more things here and there, some corrections.

Version 1.4 [7-24-2000]
Completed the maps and Jill's walkthrough. Made the "Characters"
section, the Item list, and the "Files" section.

Version 1.5 [7-28-2000]
Added the "Endings and Secrets" section.

Version 1.7 [8-3-2000]
Added the "Personal Thoughts" section. Corrected many errors. Started
Chris' walkthrough.

Version 1.8 [8-5-2000]
Completed the FAQ.

Version 1.9 [8-8-2000]
Corrected typos.

Version 2.0 [8-18-2000]
Last format mistakes corrected. Final version unless I receive some
frequently asked questions.

Final Version [4-29-2001]
Apparently, the version of the game exclusive to the Director's Cut
edition is called "Arranged" in the US version, while it is
"Advanced" in the European version. I modified the writing below the
title so no one should e-mail me anymore asking why they can't find
an item where I wrote you should find it. This will be the last
update.

Update [2-27-2002]
I have modified the ASCII title. I have also slightly modified the
text to correct my bad English.


=====================================================================
2. STORY
=====================================================================

JULY 1998

In the past months, strange incidents occurred on the Arklay
Mountains, near Raccoon City. Many people who went up there were
attacked and eaten by unknown creatures and mysterious assassins.
S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Services) Bravo team went
there to investigate, but they all disappeared. So, the Alpha Team
got a helicopter and took off to look for their comrades.

Jill Valentine spots smoke in the distance. The helicopter, flown by
Brad Vickers, lands there. Here, Chris Redfield, Jill, Barry Burton,
Albert Wesker, and Joseph Frost look at the remains of Bravo Team's
helicopter. No one's there. They start looking for survivors, but
something is watching them as they wander in the tall grass...

Joseph finds something, and calls his teammates. Slowly, he begins to
lift a handgun from the ground, but he screams in horror when he
realizes that the hand which used to hold it is still hanging from
it. Then, he's attacked by some weird-looking dogs. The others shoot,
but they can no more help their friend, who is killed and devoured by
the creatures. To make things worse, Brad takes off, leaving them
behind. While running, Chris spots a house. They all run towards it,
hoping to find shelter.

The dogs are waiting for them to get back out...


=====================================================================
3. CHARACTERS
=====================================================================

---S.T.A.R.S. ALPHA TEAM---

CHRIS REDFIELD

After being kicked out of the Air Force, Chris became a drifter until
he met Barry Burton. Barry recruited him for the newly formed
S.T.A.R.S.. Now Chris has been reassigned to a smaller unit at
Raccoon City headquarters.

Chris is one of the two characters you can control in the game.
Playing as Chris means playing Resident Evil in Hard mode, which
wasn't a good thing in the Standard version, and is even less funny
in the Advanced/Arranged version. Chris begins its adventure equipped
only with a Combat Knife and a First Aid Spray. He can carry up to
SIX items, forcing you to do lots of thinking and backtracking, and
obviously enabling less space for weapons. He won't find any bazooka,
so where Jill finds Bazooka Rounds, Chris will find Shotgun Shells
(or something even less useful). He can't pick locks, so he'll need a
special key to open some doors, and small keys to open locked desks.
He will also encounter more monsters than Jill, although he can take
more hits before dying. He will be helped in his quest by Rebecca
Chambers.

JILL VALENTINE

An intelligent soldier that has rescued many S.T.A.R.S. members from
danger in the past, Jill has been reassigned to Raccoon City just
like Chris. She is excellent with special mechanical devices such as
lockpicks.

Playing as Jill means you'll play the game in Easy mode. Jill can
carry up to eight items, begins the adventure with a loaded Beretta,
and will soon find a Bazooka. She can use the Lockpick to open doors
and desks, and she can play the piano and handle chemicals. She also
encounters less enemies than Chris, but she can take less damage then
he. Jill will be helped by Barry Burton, who'll save her from many
traps and attacks. Is she perfect? Well, no. Unfortunately, she has a
terrible British accent, and worse, she isn't as beautiful as she is
in Resident Evil 3 (and not so well-dressed neither :p).

BARRY BURTON

Chris Redfield's old friend and partner. Former SWAT member, Barry
maintains and supplies weapons for all S.T.A.R.S. members. He has
over 16 years of experience, and has led many successful projects.

Barry is Jill Valentine's supporting character. He will give her
items and save her nice ass in many dangerous situations. He's also
equipped with the most powerful handgun in the game. However, he
tends to act and talk quite stupidly, and I just HATE finding him in
rooms that I've unlocked just a second earlier.

ALBERT WESKER

Wesker has risen quickly inside the S.T.A.R.S. organization and
currently leads the Alpha Team. Viewed by many as a "cool guy", from
his snappy haircut to his perpetual shades, Wesker was recruited by a
headhunter for his sharp insight and eventually founded the
S.T.A.R.S. unit in Raccoon City.

You'll see Wesker three (or four) times in the whole game, and he
won't be of any use. His only purpose is to give you trouble.

BRAD VICKERS

Computer expert and good at gaining info. However, he's afraid of
death and tends to run away from danger. That's why he's been
nicknamed "Chickenheart".

JOSEPH FROST

Former member of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. He'll die VERY soon.


---S.T.A.R.S. BRAVO TEAM---

ENRICO MARINI

Leader of Bravo Team. Jill and Chris will meet him in the
underground, but unfortunately, there's no way to save him from
death.

RICHARD AIKEN

S.T.A.R.S. radio operator. Our heroes will find him still alive, but
not for long.

EDWARD DEWEY

The Bravo Team pilot. The ripped hand we see in the intro is probably
one of his.
He's become doggie food.

FOREST SPEYER

You'll find him dead on the mansion's balcony, pecked to death by
crows.

KENNETH J. SULLIVAN

The first dead body found in the game.

REBECCA CHAMBERS

The youngest member of the group, Rebecca has been recruited for her
knowledge of field medicine and First Aid. She is nervous around
other members, both because of her age and lack of experience.

Well, I keep on wondering how could Rebecca Chambers ever be the main
character in Resident Evil Zero, since she's just 18 in the first
game. Anyway, she is Chris Redfield's supporting character, and she
will do anything Jill Valentine can do by herself, except for
defending herself from the monsters ;). And, she isn't as good as
Jill when it comes to play the piano. However, she will save Chris'
butt in many occasions.


=====================================================================
4. WEAPONS AND AMMO
=====================================================================

---WEAPONS---

COMBAT KNIFE: ugh! What's this? Are you supposed to actually KILL
anything with this ridiculous thing? Well, you can use it against ONE
zombie if you want to spare bullets, but it'll take a lot of time and
free space behind you. And the risks of being hit are just too high.
Put this *cough* weapon *cough* in the first storage box you find,
it's a better place for it.

BERETTA M92FS: MUCH better than the Knife. It can kill a zombie
(about six bullets) and a cerberus (about four bullets, but sometimes
it may require up to seven). It can sometimes blow away a zombie's
head with the first shot (rare, but SO exciting! You just HAVE to see
it!), or with the second (you'll kill many zombies this way). This
weapon becomes useless after you leave the Guardhouse.

SHOTGUN: a VERY good piece of weaponry. If fired from very close
range, it will destroy a zombie's head. You can kill many zombies
with a single shot if they're lined up properly. Very effective
against cerberuses. It is good against bosses and hunters, but I'd
rather find some better weapon to fight the latter, since they're way
too quick for the Shotgun.

BAZOOKA: Whooooooooaaaaaaaaa! Time to do some serious killing, man!
This will be your weapon of choice if you're playing with Jill
(unfortunately, Chris can't find one anywhere). It comes loaded with
six Explosive Rounds, and it will almost always wipe out zombies and
cerberuses with a single hit. The power of the different Rounds
depends on the enemy. The Explosive ones are good against zombies and
cerberuses and the Acid ones are very good against hunters, while you
should keep the Flame Rounds to fight Plant 42.

FLAMETHROWER: only found if you're playing as Chris. It is not so
good, and picking it up will lock the door next to it. Plus, you
can't refill it: you get it with 240 fuel (i.e., 9 seconds of
continuous fire) and when that's over, well, that's it. I NEVER use
it, not even for fun (you're not even supposed to have fun while
using Chris. The only feeling you can get when you reach the area
with the Flamethrowers is frustration, believe me).

COLT PYTHON: everyone's favorite, I think. This almighty revolver
can hold up to six Magnum bullets. One shot from this killer will
take care of almost every non-boss enemy. Hunters may occasionally
take two hits to die, while chimeras will need two or three to fall.
Be sure to collect every single bullet you find.


---AMMO---

CLIPS: these are used to load your Beretta. Every one is worth 15
bullets, and there's plenty to find. However, Chris may end up
running out of ammo (hell! Aren't though guys supposed to go around
blowing everything to smithereens with a big, noisy, fully-loaded
machine gun? And we thought there was nothing worse than Doom...
:)).

SHELLS: every box contains seven Shells for the Shotgun. Pick them
up, you're gonna need them almost everywhere.

BAZOOKA ROUNDS: there are three types of these: Explosive, Acid and
Flame Rounds. The Explosive ones' boxes have a grey lid, the Acid
ones' have a yellow lid, and the Flame ones' have a... guess what?...
red lid. The Exp. rounds are very good against zombies and
cerberuses. As Barry states, the Acid rounds are "very powerful...
especially against living things". Are hunters living things? You can
bet. Give them a free acid shower, but don't underestimate their
reaction.
The Flame rounds are basically good against plants. There are only a
few of these Rounds, which should be spared for the boss in the
Guardhouse.

MAGNUM ROUNDS: the absolute best. Every box is worth a full barrel
for your trusty Colt Python. There aren't many of these, so use them
wisely.


=====================================================================
5. ENEMIES
=====================================================================

ZOMBIE: the first monster you'll come to fight in the game. They're
slow and dumb, but can hurt you pretty badly if they manage to bite
your flesh. Some of them can vomit (yes, that's right) acid when
you're close, so beware. They like to come at you in packs, or to
attack in pairs from your back and from your front, at the same time.
Many of them are hidden behind corners, so be careful when running.
You can even find some laying with their face to the floor. These
ones will grab your leg and bite it if you get too close, so shoot
them right away. If you don't, your character will automatically
stomp on or kick the monster's head, ending the fight. Every weapon
is effective against them - even the Knife - but firearms are the
best choice. Zombies are easily avoided in large spaces, so you may
prefer to spare some bullets and just run.

CERBERUS: this decaying dog loves to surprise attack you by bursting
into rooms, breaking the windows and scaring you to death. They'll
fall on the floor when hit, then get up and growl before charging at
you again. They give out a whine when killed. They're never alone, so
if you kill one, be prepared to fight at least another one in the
same area. Any firearm is effective against them. If they come at you
at full speed they'll leap at you, so shoot before they get too
close, or you may not have the time to fire before you're hit.

CROWS: never fight them. There's always a large number of them, and
if they get you, you may not be able to run away before they've
pecked you to death. If you HAVE to fight them, use the Shotgun to
kill many in a single shot. They're very rare, but you'd better run
if they attack you.

SNAKES: they fall from the trees or the ceiling when you pass by. Run
away and don't get hit, or you'll be poisoned. Very rare, but
annoying nevertheless.

GIANT SPIDER: this enemy is not only disgusting, but dangerous, too.
It hangs from the ceiling, spitting its acid drool at you. If you get
close, it will drop and attack you with its acid, as well as with its
legs and bites. Try not to use the shotgun on them, because if you
kill them using that weapon, a bunch of tiny spiders will come out of
their dead bodies and crawl all over you. Get out of the room to get
rid of them, or just walk over them to squash 'em. If you can, kill
the spiders with the Beretta, for this will kill the tiny ones inside
the mother. These enemies are very rare and often found in large
spaces, so try to run instead of fighting.

WASP: only found in the Guardhouse. They will come out of their nest
if you get close to it. Their number is infinite, so DON'T get stung
or you may not be able to run away. They can be killed with any
weapon, but there's really no point in doing such a thing.

NEPTUNE: a shark. There are three of them in the whole game - one
adult, and its two offspring. They're in the Guardhouse basement. You
can't kill them as long as they're in the water, and they can't
really hit you when you dry out the room, so just run when you first
see them.

HUNTER: probably the deadliest non-boss enemy in the whole game. The
hunter is a kind of greenish, skinless monkey with razor-sharp claws,
big teeth, unbelievable stamina, and the ability to run very fast and
leap VERY high. If they leap and stab you while in mid-air and you're
in "Danger!" status, they'll send your head flying. The shotgun is
almost useless, as it needs up to five shells to kill one. If you see
a hunter and it still hasn't seen you, run like hell. These things
are too dangerous, and if you shoo them, you run the risk of missing
them more than you hit them. They will be in the Mansion when you
come back from the Guardhouse. The Acid Rounds and the Colt Python
are the only weapons you should use against them. They give out a
terrible screech before dying.

CHIMERA: a dark monster that comes at you from above. It will swing
its arms at you, trying to hit you. It will occasionally drop to the
floor and chase you around. Avoid it, since it's very fast and
powerful (1-2 Magnum rounds are needed to kill a Chimera). If you're
low on energy, it will slit your throat. Chimeras are only found near
the end of the game, but they're guaranteed to give you a hell of a
time.


=====================================================================
6. TIPS
=====================================================================

                      -DON'T FIGHT - RUN INSTEAD-
This is a golden rule in Resident Evil. The only enemies you MUST
fight are those you can't avoid at all. If there's enough room to go
past them without fighting, don't waste ammo. This works with all
enemies. Just remember where you've left some enemies alive, or you
may end up running straight into their arms :).


               -CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHAT TO TAKE WITH YOU-
This is also VERY important. Your inventory is limited, and Chris' is
so much it'll sometimes make you want to cry. It will almost never
allow two weapons to fit in, so you have to choose your firepower
carefully. Use the handgun at the beginning to kill as many zombies
as you can, but when you're done with the first part of the mansion,
drop it for the rest of the game. Remember - you need room for the
ammo too. And, just don't pick up everything you see. Only pick up
herbs if you need them, and store all the F.Aid Sprays into the boxes
for later use.


                            -AIM WELL-
You can target an enemy perfectly by pressing L1. Tapping the button
repeatedly as the enemy approaches will keep your weapon locked onto
it. This is important when you're facing more than one enemy -
pressing L1 will make you switch between targets, so that you can
shoot many monsters making no mistakes. If an enemy is attacking from
above, press Up on the D-Pad to lift your weapon up. This is a must
against hunters and chimeras.


                       -MAKE SURE THEY'RE DEAD-
Even if a monster is lying on the ground, that doesn't mean it's
dead. This is particularly true of zombies, but almost every enemy
likes to cheat you by making you think it's dead, and then surprise
attacking you as you get close. You'll know they're really gone when
you see a large pool of blood spreading from their bodies. When
facing hunters or chimeras, never lower your weapon before you're
sure you've defeated them, because they're really fast and will take
advantage of any hesitation. Once, I shot a hunter, then it stood up,
leapt, hit me while in mid-air, and immediately ripped my head off
the moment its feet touched the floor - with a second, unbelievably
rapid slash. I will say that once more... they're FAST.


                 -TRIGGERED A TRAP? GET OUTTA THERE!-
If you happened to trigger a trap, or if you messed up things so that
it's become impossible for you to solve a puzzle, get out of the
room, and everything will be reset.


                      -ALWAYS CHECK YOUR HEALTH-
Do it especially when you've just been hit. The character's movements
don't vary according to health as they do in the sequels, so you must
always be aware of your condition, especially if you're using Jill -
she could be just "Fine" at one given moment, and in "Danger!" status
after being hit by a zombie.


=====================================================================
7. JILL'S WALKTHROUGH
=====================================================================


                           ----------------
                           MANSION - PART I
                           ----------------


"They have escaped into the mansion, where they thought it was safe.
Yet..."

Not a pleasant introduction, now was it? Well, you'll start your
adventure in the MAIN HALL 1F. After Wesker has expressed his
admiration for the mansion, Jill notices Chris' absence and rushes to
the front door, but Wesker stops her. Then, they hear gunfire, and
Wesker sends Jill to check. Barry joins her, and together they head
for the DINING ROOM.

DINING ROOM

After explaining what kind of room this is (what a smart guy!), Barry
will go ahead. Follow him. At the other end of the room he will find
a pool of blood (Jill doesn't understand what it is at first... what
a skilled warrior!) and ask you to find other clues. Open the nearby
door.

SOFA CORRIDOR

Go left and turn around the corner. A FMV will introduce you to your
first zombie. It seems you've disturbed his lunch (or dinner... it's
quite dark outside). As soon as it stands up, backtrack a little,
then draw out your Beretta and kill it. When it's dead, go check the
body he was eating. It's Kenneth from the Bravo Team. Check his body
three times to find two CLIPS. Now, go back to the Dining Room.

*********************************************************************
TO MAKE THE GAME EASIER: after Barry asks you to find other clues, go
back to the main hall. Wesker will send you back. Back in the dining
room, try to go to the main hall once more. Barry will stand up and
say: "Lost courage, already? It's not like you!". Now go in front of
the clock, and a zombie will enter the room. Barry will kill it. From
now on, the monsters will be a bit weaker and easier to kill. If you
ever go check Kenneth's body, you'll discover that his legs are gone,
and so are the two clips. This trick will also give you the
opportunity to witness more cut scenes throughout the game.
*********************************************************************

DINING ROOM

While you're talking to Barry, a zombie enters the room. Barry blasts
its head (I'll always wonder WHAT KIND of gun that is...). Now you
have to report this all to Wesker. Go back to the Main Hall.

MAIN HALL 1F

Wesker's gone. Now, you have two choices: either go upstairs and come
back down, or go check the passage under the stairway (much quicker,
do this!). When you're back, there will be a dialogue, then Barry
will give you the LOCKPICK and leave. Now, there are two
possibilities - it depends whether you want to spare a grenade, or
you want six more Acid Rounds. I'll explain you how to spare the
grenade, as it will save space in your inventory and make things a
bit quicker later - but don't worry, I'll explain you the other
possibility as well.

Now, some info about this room. There's a table with an INK RIBBON
and a typewriter on it. There are tons of Ink Ribbons scattered
throughout the game, so you don't really need this one, but nothing
keeps you from picking it up. The choice is yours.
The other thing you should know is that you can open the front door
for a nice FMV. This usually happens only once, then Jill won't open
that door any more. Dan Birlew (a.k.a. President Evil) states in his
walkthrough that if you open the front door again, a cerberus will
enter the room and attack you, but this _never_ happened to me, so I
wouldn't know. If you manage to open the door again, be prepared for
a fight.

Head for the Sofa Corridor, and go towards the double doors at its
end. Use the Lockpick to open the nearby door and enter the...

PIANO BAR

Go around the piano. You'll find a shelf there. Push it to reveal the
MUSIC NOTES, and take them. Now, go in front of the piano and use
them. Jill will perform Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (what a woman!
She doesn't even need to practice a bit!), and a secret passage will
open. Now go back to the Main Hall 1F, and go upstairs.

MAIN HALL 2F

Climb the stairs to your right. There are two doors. Go to the
farthest one and open it.

BALCONY PASSAGE

Nothing major here. Go open the other door.

BALCONY

Watch out! There's a gun pointed at your head!... oh, relax, it's
just Barry. A terrible dialogue will follow this nice meeting (Barry
must be BLIND... what does it mean, "You don't have a weapon?".
What's that Beretta then? A cigarette lighter? Man, how I'd like to
put my hands around the neck of the ones who wrote the dialogues...).
You will receive the BAZOOKA (Yay! Party time!). Check Forest's body
to find the MANSION KEY (to be precise, this is the ARMOR key. If you
want to see such items with their proper name in your inventory, just
check them). Now return to the Main Hall 1F, and open the door left
of the blue one.

*********************************************************************
If you didn't go to the Music Room before going upstairs, or if you
didn't use the trick to make the game easier, Barry won't be on the
Balcony. Therefore, if you try to get the Armor Key, Forest will
stand up and attack you (shocking! Made me jump the first time
around... this is the kind of things the Standard version didn't
feature). So, walk VERY SLOWLY and get the Bazooka before you awake
him, so you'll kill him with a single shot. When you return to the
Main Hall 2F, you'll meet Barry, who'll give you six ACID ROUNDS.
This will also happen if you check the first floor first - Barry
should be here as soon as you get to Main Hall 2F.
*********************************************************************

GLOBE ROOM

(Named after that thing standing in the middle of it).
Look out for the zombie waiting for you near the door. There are
three of them in this room, and there's a CLIP in front of the
mirror. In the rear corridor, open the drawer with the Lockpick to
find some SHELLS. Now go open that door at the end of the corridor.

MIRROR ROOM

Immediately raise your weapon and shoot the zombie (nice reflection,
don't you think?). You can find two GREEN HERBS in this room, and a
hidden INK RIBBON on the little stage left of the door. Go to the
door opposite the mirror, and open it.

CHANGE ROOM

You can change your dress here. You can put on the black dress or the
S.T.A.R.S. uniform (my favorite!), or you can just skip this room and
return to the Main Hall 1F.

MAIN HALL 1F

Open the blue door.

STATUE ROOM

Push the ladder in front of the statue, and climb it to get the MAP
OF FIRST FLOOR. If you push aside that shelf and enter the small
passage, you'll find two zombies on the floor. WATCH OUT! They're NOT
dead. Shoot them until they're REALLY dead, and take the INK RIBBON
on the shelf if you want. When you're done, use the Lockpick to open
the next door.

L-SHAPED CORRIDOR

If you've never played this game before, you're in for one of the
biggest (and baddest) surprises of your life (well, of your
videogaming life, at least). Turn your face to the door you came in
from, and press the Down arrow on your Pad. Walking backwards, you'll
be ready to shoot the cerberus which'll burst in from one of the
windows (this one makes me jump EVERY DAMN TIME!). Get rid of it,
then turn around the corner and be prepared to kill another one. Now,
see that brown, empty shelf? Push it aside, and check the floor for a
CLIP. Now go on.

TWISTED CORRIDOR

There's a GREEN HERB just right of the door. Open the first door
you'll find.

PATIO

Draw out your weapon and kill the cerberus. As soon as you turn round
the corner, another one will leap towards you from the garden
outside, so be ready. There are 5 GREEN HERBS here, along with the
CHEMICAL. Take this. When you return towards the door, watch out for
the third cerberus. You can easily avoid it. Back in the Twisted
Corridor, open the next door.

BATHROOM

In this room you'll find a CLIP in front of the mirror, and one
zombie. If you go for the Clip before you see the zombie, you'll see
it coming at you in the mirror (quite scary if you don't know it's
there...). You can easily overrun it, so don't waste your bullets on
it. Take the Clip if you want, and go back to the corridor. Go on
until you come to some double doors, and open them.

DARK CORRIDOR

It sure is dark in here! Kill the two zombies who'll come moaning at
you. The third one is at the other end of the hall, and it can be
easily avoided. Anyway, go open that door at the end of the corridor
(NOT the one in the narrow passage), and make sure you have one free
space in your inventory.

PAINTING GALLERY

See those crows up there? Make one mistake here and they'll all fly
down together to peck you to death. Shoot anything, anytime, and they
will do the same.

There are eight pictures in this room. Seven of them represent seven
different stages of life. Below each one of them is a switch. You
have to push those switches in the right order - that is, from the
youngest man to the dead one. If you push the switch below the
picture at the very end of the hall before you've pushed the other
ones in the correct sequence, the crows will attack you. The right
order is:

-Newborn baby
-Infant
-Lively boy
-Young man
-Middle-aged man
-Old man
-"The end of life"

or, if you prefer, the third, the fifth, the sixth, the fourth, the
second, the seventh, and the eighth (from the entry door).

When you've pushed them all, the last picture will fall to reveal the
WIND CREST. Take it and go back to the Dark Corridor. Unlock the
first door after the double doors, and go through it.

STAIRWELL

Two zombies and a GREEN HERB. Dispose of each and enter the room
below the stairs.

STORAGE ROOM

This is a Save Room. Open the box. Take out the two CLIPS and put in
the Wind Crest, the Combat Knife, the F.Aid Spray, the Acid Rounds if
you have them, the Chemical, and any Ink Ribbon or Herb you might
have. Pick up the BROKEN SHOTGUN and go back to the Dark Corridor. Go
through the double doors, and open the door opposite them.

TRAPROOM

Wondering at the name of this room? Well, I'll explain it in better
detail later... for now, just open the other door.

SHOTGUN ROOM

Three zombies are waiting for you here. Kill them and go take the
SHOTGUN. Now USE the broken one to put it in its place. If the game
doesn't allow you to do that, press X in front of the wall. You'll be
asked if you want to put down the Shotgun. Say no, then USE the
broken one, and this time, it'll work.

What's the broken shotgun for? Well, if you don't put it there, the
ceiling in the previous room will crush you to death, since the other
door will be stuck. If you want the Shotgun without putting the
broken one in its place, you mustn't meet Barry on the second floor
before you come here. If you do so, Barry will come and open the
door, saving you from the descending ceiling. But that would cost you
a LOT of backtracking, so it's not worth it (although it's FUN! If
you ever do it, just listen to Jill's voice when she founds out she's
only got a few seconds to escape! No, I'm not a sadist... why do you
ask?).

Now go back to the Storage Room and put the Bazooka into the box if
you didn't before, then go upstairs.

CORRIDOR 2F

Two zombies are waiting for you. Equip the Shotgun and blast their
heads off (isn't it GREAT?). There's another one behind the corner at
the other end of the corridor, but you don't really need to go there,
although I'll explain what's there - you just know he's hiding there,
OK? Now, unlock the middle door and open it.

STAG ROOM

No one here? Hmmmm... that's quite strange. No, don't worry, that
stag won't attack you (although you should expect ANYTHING in a
mansion like this). If you try to open the door right of the one you
came in from, a zombie will enter the room. Kill it, then open that
door.

BEDROOM

Man, what a creepy room! Is there anything under those sheets? Well,
I just don't feel like investigating! There's a CLIP near the wall
right of the right bed, and a RED HERB near the left one. There's
also a LIGHTER on the shelf. This is not necessary, but take it if
you want a map and some Acid Rounds later - otherwise, leave it where
it is. Leave this room and another zombie will be there for you.
Ignore it and run toward the opposite room.

AQUARIUM ROOM

Barry is here, apparently trying to hide something (he won't be here
if you didn't use the trick to make the game easier). He'll lend you
part of a RESEARCHER'S WILL (you can read the full letter if Barry
isn't here and you get to this room quickly, otherwise it'll be
already torn). After you've read it, he'll leave. There's an INK
RIBBON in the white coat near the door, if you need it. Now examine
the broken glass on the wall. You'll find a switch. Press it to drain
the aquarium. Now get between it and the cupboard, and push it
towards the desk. Then, push the cupboard towards the wall to find
the first half of the MOON CREST. Now go back to the corridor, and go
where the third zombie is. Kill it and enter the room.

FIREPLACE ROOM

There's a GREEN HERB here. Use the Lighter on the fireplace to get
the MAP OF SECOND FLOOR, if you have it. Then, go back to the
corridor, and go check the two remaining doors. The first one is
jammed, so open the other one.

RED CORRIDOR

EEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH! You're trapped between two
zombies! And there's another round the corner! (Well, to be honest,
the first time I got here he WASN'T THERE!). OK, stay cool and blast
'em both. Now go to the nearest door.

LIBRARY

Nothing really important here. Unlock the door on the other side and
read the BOTANY BOOK on the table, then get back to the Red Corridor.
Kill the third zombie (provided he's still there) and open the blue
door you'll find.

ARMORS' ROOM

Wow! Look at those armors! They're beautiful, aren't they? And so
perfectly lined up... OK, OK, you don't like them, do you? Well, take
a look around. There are two holes in the floor, two heavy-looking
statues, a switch, and a locked shelf. Now, let's explain the whole
thing first. If you push that switch before covering the two holes,
poisonous gas will be released in the room, putting you in POISON
status or killing you (yes, it _can_ kill you). So, you have to push
the two statues over the two holes. Push the one nearest to the door
sidewards twice to cover the first hole. Then, push the other one
ahead five times, and left twice. Now press the switch. The glass
locking the shelf will lower to reveal the EMBLEM. Take it and leave.
Go open the next door you'll find down the corridor.

RICHARD'S ROOM

There are two GREEN HERBS in this room. If you go round the corner,
you'll find Richard Aiken from Bravo Team. He's been bitten by a
poisonous snake, and he needs serum. Jill will automatically leave
the room and your map will be shown so that you can see your
destination (that's the red-flashing room, if you didn't get it).
Open the last door of this corridor to enter Main Hall 2F again. Now
go to the other side of the room, and open the door you didn't open
before.

DINING ROOM 2F

You've got plenty of time to get rid of the three zombies before they
even spot you (well, almost). When they're gone for good, push the
statue towards the opening in the rail, then make it fall to the room
below. Now, go on to the next room.

NARROW CORRIDOR

Be ready to kill the zombie, and watch out for the one just round the
corner. You shouldn't have any problems with the last one. Go
downstairs.

WOODEN CORRIDOR

Take some steps forward, and try not to get too frightened when a
cerberus will burst into the room. Kill it, then open the door near
the stairs.

INFIRMARY

There's an INK RIBBON on the bed. Open the box and put away the
Lighter, the half Crest, and any Ink Ribbon or Herb you might have.
Take the Chemical with you. Get out and proceed down the corridor.
There are two more cerberuses to be killed. Unlock the first door
you'll find and discard the Armor Key, then open the door.

WEAPON ROOM

Open the drawer to find some SHELLS. On the shelves you'll find a
CLIP and - no, it can't be true! - the marvelous COLT PYTHON! Now,
don't you even TRY to equip it. You're gonna need every single bullet
of this beauty. Just get out, and make sure you have at least one
free space in your inventory, then open the last door.

GREEN CORRIDOR

Kill the two zombies (watch out, one of them is pretty fast). Go down
the narrower passage to find another zombie - and another door. Blast
the former, and open the latter.

GREENHOUSE

That plant is moving! Well, at least you know it's alive. See that
machine in the corner? Put your Chemical in it to send the plant to
bed. In this room you'll find 4 GREEN HERBS and 2 RED HERBS, but the
most important thing is the SUN CREST on the wall. Get it and leave.
Back to the previous door, take the other passage. Ignore the small
alcove for now, and use the Lockpick to unlock the door. Get in.

KEEPER'S ROOM

Take the CLIP on the bed if you want. Equip the Shotgun and approach
the desk. If you try to check it, a zombie will come out of the
cupboard! Danger!!! It's insanely close!! Aim your Shotgun and fire.
If you miss, hope nobody saw you, otherwise you're doomed to a life
of shame :). Take the SHELLS in the cupboard and read the KEEPER'S
DIARY. Leave and open the door at the end of the corridor. You'll be
back in the Sofa Corridor. Go to the Piano Bar.

PIANO BAR

Enter the secret passage and take the GOLD EMBLEM. Uh-oh. The passage
closed behind you. You're trapped! Hey, c'mon, don't cry... I was
just kidding! Of _course_ you understood that you could open it up by
putting the Emblem into the hole (you did, didn't you?). Now, I want
you to consider something. See that glass wall? There's the
Greenhouse on the other side. Well, wouldn't it be logical to shoot
the window, stomp on the five billions glass pieces, and enjoy your
nice new shortcut? No, wait, don't do that. It WOULD be logical, but
you can't do it. You know, pre-rendered rooms and stuff like that.
What a pity, huh? Leave this room and go to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM

Put the Gold Emblem into the hole above the fireplace. The clock will
slide sidewards to reveal the BLUE JEWEL (this is the MOST BEAUTIFUL
item I ever got in a videogame... look at it! You could spend the
whole day looking at it! Take some time to CHECK it and turn it over
to examine its whole surface... man, I whish I had one!). While
you're here, check the remains of the statue you pushed from above to
find the STAR CREST. Go back to the Green Corridor, and finally go
into that small alcove. Open the door.

TIGER ROOM

What a fine statue! Put the Blue Jewel in its eye (*sigh*... I'd keep
it forever if I just could... *sniff*) to uncover the SHIELD KEY. Now
go back to the Infirmary.

INFIRMARY

Put the Star Crest into the box and take out the Lighter. Take the
SERUM from the shelf, too. Put away the Beretta, and keep the Shotgun
and the Bazooka. Now it's a good time to save your game. Oh, and put
away that Colt Python, too. I know that having it in your pocket
makes you feel good (SO good...), but you don't really need it now.
Return to Richard's Room.

RICHARD'S ROOM

If I did my calculations well, Richard should be dead by now. Hey,
what's that expression on your face? Wear it off AT ONCE! You wanted
to save him? Well, YOU COULDN'T! He would have died anyway, and you
would have wasted that precious Serum. C'mon, don't look at me like
that... Well, now, search Richard's body for a CLIP (why do you say
I'm cruel now?) and move on.

*********************************************************************
Anyway, if you come back here quickly with the Serum after you're
sent looking for it, Jill will give Richard a shot. He will lend her
the RADIO and die. There's no point in doing this, although you may
want to see the cinema. It's up to you, but I'd rather do everything
there's to do while on the first floor than hurrying back here and
having to backtrack after Richard has died.
*********************************************************************

ATTIC PASSAGE

Kill the two zombies before they can even see you. Turn left and open
the door.

CANDLE ROOM

Use the Lighter to light the candles on the table. There's an INK
RIBBON on the table, and a CLIP inside the left cupboard. If you push
the right one aside, you'll find a small passage leading to some ACID
ROUNDS. Now, go back to the Attic Passage and climb the steps. Unlock
the door and discard the Shield Key.

ATTIC

Walk up to the middle of the room. EEEEEEEKKKKKKK! What's that? A
SNAKE? Man, that's HUGE! What gave them the idea for such a
monstrosity? Well, we'll probably never know. Now you have two
choices: fight or run. If you manage to lure it behind the middle
column, it might get stuck for a while, trying to get around. This
will give you the opportunity to rush forward and get the second half
of the MOON CREST in the nook it came in from. However, if you're not
fast enough, it will trap you and kill you in a moment. If you don't
feel like trying, FIGHT! Its bites will poison you, but you've got
the Serum, right? So, that's not a problem. Just run around the
place, hiding behind the column, and shoot it with the Bazooka. If
you run out of ammo, use the Shotgun. Shouldn't it be enough (I
doubt), you'll find some SHELLS nearby. If you are in "Danger!"
status, the next time it hits you it'll swallow you whole, from head
to toes (YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!). Whenever you get the Crest, leave the
Attic. You shouldn't be poisoned, but should you be, you will pass
out, and Barry will take you to the Infirmary. Either way, go to the
Storage Room and take the heavy artillery with you. Combine the two
halves of the Moon Crest to get the whole one, then go to the Dark
Corridor and take the door in the narrow passage.

*********************************************************************
THE SERUM GLITCH

This screwed up my game, causing me to restart from the previous
saved game. It's quite simple: DON'T use the serum to cure the poison
BEFORE you've beaten the snake. Why? Because if you use the Serum and
get bitten again, you will be poisoned again. If this happens, when
you leave the Attic, Jill will act as she's been poisoned, like in
the scene where she passes out and Barry comes to save her. This time
though, you will regain control of her like she wasn't poisoned. From
now on, you will be in "Poison!" status. A Blue Herb will NOT remove
it, because Jill won't use it, saying you don't need it at the
moment. You'll be poisoned for the rest of the game! And, you know,
this just isn't good. Avoid it at all costs, or do it if you want the
game to be more challenging... (crazy people are everywhere... :))
*********************************************************************

COURTYARD PASSAGE

Kill the two cerberuses. Now reach the door at the other end. It's
locked. Look at the plate on the wall. See those holes in it? Just
use the four Crests in them, and the door will unlock. Open it.

WAREHOUSE

Push the ladder below the shelf high on the wall to gain access to
the SQUARE CRANK. Take it and open the next door.


                                ------
                                GARDEN
                                ------


COURTYARD

There are three cerberuses in this room. Kill 'em all. Here you'll
find two GREEN HERBS, two BLUE HERBS, and the MAP OF GARDEN (it's on
the wall at the end of the narrow passage). Go on and open the rusty
gate.

POOL

Follow the passage on the left until you come to a column with a
plate on it. Use the Crank in the hole to drain the pool, then go to
the other side. Now hold the run button, and run along the way. Seven
snakes will fall from the trees as you run. They're poisonous and not
so easy to kill, so just avoid them. When you reach the elevator,
step on it and activate it.

WATERFALL COURTYARD

Three cerberuses are waiting for you here. Avoid them and run to the
next gate, which is at the other end of the area.

GUARDHOUSE PASSAGE

There are two GREEN HERBS and two BLUE HERBS near the door if you
need them. A cerberus will come to meet you. Kill it. This passage
has two corners, and behind each one is a cerberus. Kill the second
one, but try to avoid the third if you can, so to spare some ammo.
Now enter the Guardhouse.


                              ----------
                              GUARDHOUSE
                              ----------


MAIN CORRIDOR

There are three BLUE HERBS opposite the entrance. Push the nearby
statue down the long corridor, and try to cover the hole in the floor
with it. If you don't, a tentacle will burst out of the hole and try
to choke you. Be careful. Now enter the first door you'll find.

BEDROOM

This is a Save Room. On the shelf you can find some EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS
and a F.AID SPRAY. Get out and enter the opposite room.

DORMITORY 001

You'll find 2 zombies here. Get rid of them and open the desk to find
some SHELLS. Don't even bother to enter the bathroom - there's
nothing there. Go back to the corridor, and open the red double doors
at its end.

BAR

Immediately run to the left (Jill's left, not yours). Wait for the
nearest spider to fall, then rush to the alcove and hide behind the
pool table. Kill the spider. Examine the southern side of the table,
and take note of the code (it should be 9-5-8, dunno if it changes in
later games - apparently, it did in the Standard version of the
game). Kill the other spider as well, and take the RED BOOK on one of
the tables. Go back to the corridor. Go down the small passage to
find a new door. Look out for the tentacle that will pop out of the
hole. It shouldn't be there if you placed the statue properly before.
Open the door.

LONG CORRIDOR

At the other end of the corridor there's a statue. Push it ahead to
find three GREEN HERBS. Anyway, enter the first door you'll find when
coming from the Main Corridor.

WASP NEST ROOM

There's an alcove in this room. There, you'll find a giant wasp nest
with a table below it. Run there and pick up the DORMITORY KEY (002)
from the table, then immediately get out of the room to reset the
wasps.

Now you have two choices. I'll explain them separately.


------------------------------THE V-JOLT-----------------------------
Go to the end of the Long Corridor, and try to open the door labeled
"002". You'll hear someone arguing inside (turn up the volume if you
want to make out something of it). When it's finished, open the door,
discard the Key, and enter the room.

DORMITORY 002

Barry is here, and behaves oddlier than ever. When you're done
talking to him, take the DORMITORY MAP from the wall, and open the
desk for some SHELLS. Read the PLANT 42 REPORT that's on the bed,
then open the door that leads to the bathroom.

*********************************************************************
If you listen to the conversation from outside, then go to the Wasp
Nest Room or the Main Corridor, and finally come back here, Barry
won't be here. Note that this whole event won't occur if you didn't
use the trick to make the game easier.
*********************************************************************

BATHROOM 002

Kill the two zombies and get the DORMITORY KEY (003) from the sink.
Go back to the Wasp Nest Room and unlock the door labeled "003".
Discard the Key and enter.

DORMITORY 003

Kill the zombie. There's an INK RIBBON in the desk. Examine the
bookshelf to find the "V-JOLT" REPORT, which you should read VERY
CAREFULLY. Now, replace that white book with the red one to reveal a
secret door. Go to the bathroom (in the game, of course ^_^).

BATHROOM 003

Kill the zombie, and pick up one of the very few FLAME ROUNDS boxes
you're going to find in the whole game. Load your Bazooka and go back
to the Wasp Nest Room.

WASP NEST ROOM

You can see another door in the camera angle you get when you enter.
Go there. It's locked, but there are some numerical keys next to it.
Enter the code you found on the pool table, and open the door.

CHEMICALS ROOM

Now you have to have some fun with the chemicals to create the
powerful V-Jolt. You need three empty spaces in your inventory in
order to do this. Pick up three of the four empty bottles you find in
the room. Now, stick to the following instructions. Put some water in
one bottle. Put UMB No.2 in another, and combine them to make NP-003.
Now get some UMB No.4, and combine it with NP-003 to make UMB No.7.
Get UMB No.2 and UMB No.4, and combine them to make Yellow-6. Combine
it with UMB No.7 to make UMB No.13. Now, make some more NP-003 and
combine it with UMB No.13 to make the V-JOLT. If you make a mistake
while mixing the chemicals, you may create a substance which'll
release a poisonous gas (isn't all that poison annoying after a
while?).

DORMITORY 002

Push the left bookshelf ahead, and push the right one aside to reveal
a ladder. Descend it.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

Go to the end of the passage. There's some water blocking the way
(it's only a few feet deep, but hey, what would this game be without
some puzzles? You'd finish it in half an hour! ^_^). Push the last
crate into the water, and do the same with the one next to it. Now go
back to the first crate. Push it towards the passage where the ladder
is three times, then get round it and push it towards the wall
opposite the ladder. Now push it all the way to the pool, and into
the water to finally clear the way. There are two GREEN HERBS in the
last corner, just before a BIG pool of water. Open the double doors.

AQUARIUM

The tank in the middle of the room has broken, flooding almost the
whole basement. Enter the nearest room.

ROOTS ROOM

Use the V-Jolt on the roots. Now go back to Dormitory 003, and open
the secret door.

FIREPLACE ROOM

Walk up to the center of the room. UGH! And what's THAT supposed to
be? An octopus plant? Anyway, it's clear someone made a BIG mistake
with those fertilizers - and it's up to you to correct that mistake.
Plant 42 has two kind of attacks: it can thrust you with its
tentacles if you get too close, and it can drop acid on you from
above. If you see some small drops falling on you from above, run.
Hug the walls and don't stay in the same spot for more than 4-5
seconds, and you should be okay. Aim up with your Bazooka and unleash
your Flame Rounds. You'll win in no time. Now take the C.ROOM KEY
from the fireplace, and go to DORMITORY 002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------------------------THE BIG BATTLE--------------------------

Go to the end of the Long Corridor and try to open the door labeled
"002". You'll hear someone arguing inside (turn up the volume if you
want to make out something of it). When it's finished, open the door,
discard the Key, and enter the room.

DORMITORY 002

Barry is here, and behaves oddlier than ever. When you're done
talking to him, take the DORMITORY MAP from the wall, and open the
desk for some SHELLS. Read the PLANT 42 REPORT that's on the bed,
then open the door that leads to the bathroom.

*********************************************************************
If you listen to the conversation from outside, then go to the Wasp
Nest Room or the Main Corridor and finally come back here, Barry
won't be here. Note that this whole event won't occur if you didn't
use the trick to make the game easier.
*********************************************************************

BATHROOM 002

Kill the two zombies and get the DORMITORY KEY (003) from the sink.
Go back to the Wasp Nest Room and unlock the door labeled "003".
Discard the Key and enter.

DORMITORY 003

Kill the zombie. There's an INK RIBBON in the desk. Examine the
bookshelf to find the "V-JOLT" REPORT. Now, replace that white book
with the red one to reveal a secret door. Go to the bathroom (in the
game, of course ^_^).

BATHROOM 003

Kill the zombie and pick up one of the very few FLAME ROUNDS boxes
you're going to find in the whole game. Load your Bazooka and go back
to the Dormitory 003. Open the secret door.

FIREPLACE ROOM

EYOW! Another one of those big-as-hell-and-oh-so-damn-tough giant
things! What's that supposed to be, an octopus plant? Well, that's
what the reports refer to as "Plant 42" and is actually the biggest
living thing in the game. Luckily, it's also one of the easiest to
defeat (if you have enough guts to fight it, of course :p). Plant 42
has two kinds of attack: it can swipe you with its tentacles if you
get too close, and it drops acid from the ceiling. If you see some
small drops fall from directly above you, run and you'll be safe.
Just hug the walls and don't stay in the same spot for more than 4-5
seconds. Aim up with your Bazooka and unleash your Flame Rounds. 3
hits should be enough, but it's not over yet. Acid is still falling
from above. Get close to the center of the room and Plant 42 will
grow up again. Do as before and you'll win - one Flame Round should
be all you need to destroy that oversized vegetable forever. Take the
C.ROOM KEY from the fireplace and go to Dormitory 002.


*********************************************************************
BARRY TO THE RESCUE!

If you didn't meet Barry in Dormitory 002, the game will take over
after you defeat Plant 42 for the first time. The plant will grow up
again and grab you with one of its tentacles, but Barry will enter
the room and use his new flamethrower (I wonder wherever he got it)
and do the work for you. Thanks again big guy!
*********************************************************************

---------------------------------------------------------------------


***NOTE: if you made the V-Jolt, skip the following three rooms. If
you didn't, go on reading.***

DORMITORY 002

Push the left bookshelf and push the right one aside to reveal a
ladder. Descend it.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

Go to the end of the passage. There's some water blocking the way
(it's only a few feet deep, but hey, what would this game be without
some puzzles? You'd finish it in half an hour! ^_^). Push the last
crate into the water, and do the same with the one next to it. Now go
back to the first crate. Push it towards the passage where the ladder
is three times, then get round it and push it towards the wall
opposite the ladder. Now push it all the way to the pool, and into
the water to finally clear the way. There are two GREEN HERBS in the
last corner, just before a BIG pool of water. Open the double doors.

AQUARIUM

The tank in the middle of the room has broken, flooding almost the
whole basement. Run down the right passage. As you approach the two
doors, a cool FMV will show your nice buttocks through a Neptune's
eyes. Quickly run to the doors, and unlock the left one. Discard the
Key and get in.

CONTROL ROOM

The lever near the big, flashing red light will drain the basement,
so move it. Now go where that small orange light is, and push the
button to open the nearby room. Go there.

ARSENAL

OK, OK, that's a strong name for a room which hosts two CLIPS and two
boxes of SHELLS, but I wonder what else you could pick up if all the
other stuff weren't wet and useless! Anyway, take whatever you want -
just don't forget the MANSION KEY (Helmet). Now return to the Long
Corridor.

LONG CORRIDOR

Wesker has just blown down a spider. Talk to him, then go to the
Bedroom. Put your Beretta into the box if you have it, along with all
the Clips. Take the Colt Python with you - you will need it soon. Now
go all the way back to the Mansion. Note that there are two
cerberuses in the Courtyard.


                          -----------------
                          MANSION - PART II
                          -----------------


DARK CORRIDOR

As soon as you come out of the narrow passage, the scariest FMV of
the game will take over. Something's after you. It's fast, it jumps
VERY high, it's _green_, it can OPEN DOORS (GULP!), and I just don't
like its claws at all! You'd better prepare your best weapon.

The hunter comes in. Its yellow eyes shine in the dark. It slowly
comes towards you... and then, all of a sudden, you regain control of
your character. Shoot! It will fall. Then, it will get back up.
Shoot! If you're using the Bazooka, it should be dead by now. If
you're using the Shotgun, you may need one or two more hits. If you
used the Colt Python, you probably didn't need to shoot a second time
:).

The creature will give out a terrible screech, then it will die.
Pretty tough, huh? And it was just the first! Well, don't let your
fear overwhelm you. Unlock the door you couldn't open before, and
open it.

***NOTE: believe it or not, this is one of the largest places of the
house in which you'll meet a hunter. For that reason, you may want to
just hit this one once, then rush to the door. You can (and should)
always run from hunters, even in narrow places. If you're lucky,
you'll run past them without being hit by their claw swipe. But it
won't be easy. Always carry some healing items with you until you're
completely done with the Mansion.***

STUDY

Search the table to find a switch. Push it to see things better. Take
the MAGNUM ROUNDS (yeeeeeeeesssss!!!!!!!!!) from the desk and the MO
DISK from the shelf. Get out and go to the Stairwell.

STAIRWELL

STAY ALERT! TWO hunters are waiting for you here. You really should
kill these two. Read Barry's message on the wall, then enter the
Storage Room.

STORAGE ROOM

Good ol' Barry left some goodies here for you. To be precise, you'll
find a box of SHELLS, some ACID ROUNDS (Barry's favorite, it seems),
and a F.AID SPRAY. Now you have to decide if you want to risk your
life to put your hands over 24 more Magnum Rounds. If your answer is
yes, read on. If no, SAVE your game, then skip the following section
and read from FIREPLACE ROOM on. Just make sure you have some free
space in your inventory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep a free slot in your inventory. Be sure to bring along the
Bazooka and the Colt, then leave this room and go upstairs.

CORRIDOR 2F

Immediately raise your weapon and waste the hunter. Now rush to the
Library, and get to the Red Corridor from there.

RED CORRIDOR

THREE hunters are here for you. Don't bother killing them all - just
blast the first one to make things a bit easier, then run like
there's no tomorrow until you reach Main Hall 2F. From there, go to
Dining Room 2F.

DINING ROOM 2F

Don't go down the passage where the statue used to be. Take the other
passage and run to the door.

NARROW CORRIDOR

Two hunters here. Kill them without getting hurt too much (easier
said than done), then unlock the door near the stairs and open it.

TROPHY ROOM

Read the ORDERS you'll find on the table. Pick up the SHELLS and the
MAGNUM ROUNDS. Now push the ladder until it's right below the moose
head, then return to the door and push the switch to turn off the
light. Climb the ladder and take the RED JEWEL (another exquisite
item to look at). Now get out and go downstairs.

WOODEN CORRIDOR

You can overrun the two hunters here _very_ easily. Make it to the
Green Corridor.

GREEN CORRIDOR

RUN! Those two hunters in front of you will slice you like bread if
you hesitate. Rush to the Tiger Statue, and watch out for a third
monster will come out of the alcove as you approach.

TIGER ROOM

Put the Red Jewel in the statue's right eye to receive THREE boxes of
MAGNUM ROUNDS. Now you're a one man army! Kill the hunter that's
waiting for you outside, and return to the Corridor 2F via the Red
Corridor. You can get there by retracing your steps, or by getting to
the Main Hall 1F from here and climbing the stairs to the second
floor. If you choose the latter, be warned that there are two spiders
in the Sofa Corridor. Oh, and don't enter the Corridor 2F from the
Library. Choose the other door instead.

CORRIDOR 2F

Woah! This is probably the closest look you're going to take at a
hunter in the whole game. Kill it with the Colt to see it dying from
a VERY close point of view. COOL! Now it's a good time to save your
game. Free some space in your inventory - at least two slots - and be
sure to keep your strongest weapons with you. Now head to the
Fireplace Room.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


FIREPLACE ROOM

Unlock the door and discard the Key. Open the door.

PIANO ROOM

Just too quiet in here, isn't it? Go to the piano and check it. Uh-
oh. A cut scene. Now what?

AWWWWWWWWWWWW, NO! It's that look-at-the-size-of-my-mouth-and-take-a-
trip-to-my-stomach snake! I just wonder how on Earth he fits the
passages he uses to roam the house. As you can see, it brings the
signs of its last battle with you, and this makes it SO mad! It will
break the floor like a crunchy cookie, and then charge you at full
force. Luckily (?), it's run out of poison (or is it just the effect
of the Serum?), so you have one less problem to cope with. Run around
and shoot its HEAD. This is very important. If you shoot its body,
even a whole Colt Python barrel will not be enough to kill it. Should
you win, it will dissolve, leaving a BIG spot on the floor. Check the
hole he made on the floor and Barry will come in. He'll ask you to go
down to check, and he'll produce a rope. If you didn't save Richard,
he will also give you the COM.RADIO. Then you'll climb down the rope.

TOMBSTONE ROOM

A very strange room indeed, since the only way in is the one you just
came from. As soon as you touch the floor, the rope will drop at your
feet. Barry'll apologize and go find another one (I keep on wondering
WHERE?). Go ahead and check the tombstone. Push the switch to reveal
a ladder, but DON'T climb it down yet. Wait for a while and Barry
will come back to pull you out of here. If you want to climb down the
ladder now, feel free to do it and skip the following step, but be
warned that Barry will die at the end of the game.

PIANO ROOM

After some more conversation, Barry will give you the PASS NUMBER.
This is used to open the door at the end of the Narrow Corridor on
the second floor. This gives you two different ways to gain access to
the last unexplored part of the mansion, but they're both VERY
dangerous. I personally prefer not to use the pass number, because
the way to the locked door is full of narrow rooms crawling with
hunters. If you wanna try it, skip the following section and read
from ELEVATOR CORRIDOR 2F on - otherwise, go on reading.
After Barry leaves, climb down the rope and descend the ladder you
discovered before.

MAIN CORRIDOR B1

This room proves the guys at CAPCOM were high on something illegal
when they programmed this new version of the game. There is one
hunter coming at you from the next screen, and as soon as you make
any noise, two more will run out of the corridor on your right (that
is, the left of the screen). That small lateral corridor hides a box
of SHELLS, but unless you're desperate for ammo, you'd better just
run straight ahead, past the first hunter, and to the door. Just be
careful, OK?

LARGE CORRIDOR B1

There are two useful GREEN HERBS here. Two zombies are feasting on a
third one - get close to make them stand up, and kill them. The third
zombie sure seems to be dead, and won't move if you try and shoot it,
so it SHOULD be dead. Anyway, pass behind it when heading to the
door.

KITCHEN

Go ahead and approach the door. A FMV will take over, showing a door
from the eyes of a drunk person. Ooops! Uh, well, it seems this guy
is dead, too. He will open the door and attack you. For some reason,
this is the toughest zombie in the whole mansion - he'll take up to
FIVE shells to go down, and his head just won't blow up. When it's
dead, go round the table and you'll see a narrow corridor just around
the corner. A zombie is lying on the floor. Walk very slowly, hugging
the wall until the camera angle changes, then aim down and shoot it.
This one is also quite resistant. Kill it and take the elevator to
the second floor - and be ready to run.

ELEVATOR CORRIDOR 2F

See that hunter? Well, show it your back and run to the double doors,
and watch out for the other one lurking at the end of the passage.
There's a GREEN HERB in this corridor, but don't stop to pick it up
or it won't be enough to heal you.

MAIN LIBRARY

Go left to find a desk hiding some MAGNUM ROUNDS. Carefully walk
towards the shelves. A zombie will come to you, so kill it. Go ahead
and then left. Kill the two zombies and read the SCRAPBOOK. Now go
back where the first zombie came out from. Push the bookcase aside to
reveal a door. Open it.

SECRET STUDY

There's an INK RIBBON on the table, and a CLIP on the shelf, but the
really important item to pick up here is the BATTERY on the floor by
the window. Whatever you do, don't try to look through the window, or
three crows will break it and get inside to peck your flesh. Now go
back to the Main Library and find the other door to access the...

MESSED-UP LIBRARY

There's a small space between the shelves. Go there and you'll find
yourself behind a statue. Push it ahead ONE AND A HALF TIMES. It must
NOT touch the wall. Now go to the red switch on the wall, and push it
to light up a small square of floor in the corner. Push the statue on
it to discover a secret alcove hiding the DOOM BOOK 1. Take it and
immediately CHECK it. Turn it so that you can see its pages, and
press X to open it and find the EAGLE MEDAL. Now you can go back to
the elevator and return to the Kitchen. If you want to explore the
full mansion, read on, otherwise skip the following two rooms.

CLOSET

It's the other room found in Elevator Corridor 2F. It holds two boxes
of EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS. Take them if you want.

MARBLE CORRIDOR

In this room you'll find three zombies - one of them is a fake dead,
so beware. You'll also find two GREEN HERBS, and a BLUE one. If you
chose to open the door on the second floor with the Pass Number,
you'll end up here; if you didn't, there's no way to open it from
this corridor. When you're done, go back to the Kitchen.

KITCHEN

Open the door where the zombie came from. Climb the stairs to reach
the Elevator Corridor. Unlock the door.

SOFA CORRIDOR

Two spiders are taking a walk on the ceiling. Kill them if you want,
or just run to the Dining Room 1F. Now you have to return to the
Garden: choose the path yourself, but the second floor should be
easier. Just watch out for the hunter waiting for you in the
Courtyard Passage. Remember to take the Crank with you!


                                ------
                                GARDEN
                                ------


Go to the Waterfall Courtyard, kill the cerberuses, and put the
battery in place to activate the elevator. Take it and go to the
Pool. Use the Crank again to stop the water, then go back down with
the elevator and climb down the ladder that was behind the waterfall.


                             -----------
                             UNDERGROUND
                             -----------


TYPEWRITER CORRIDOR

Yes, you can save your game here, and it'd be a good choice. Now
simply open the door near the ladder.

T-SHAPED CORRIDOR

Barry is here. Choose to go with him and have him go first. When you
hear him firing his gun, go the way he went and open the door.

SHAFT ROOM

Barry will kill a hunter (he's a damn good shooter, isn't he?).
There's an alcove with some EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS and an INK RIBBON.
Proceed to the next door and open it.

ENRICO'S CORRIDOR

Go ahead until the game takes over. Enrico Marini from S.T.A.R.S.
Bravo Team will say something about a traitor in S.T.A.R.S., then
someone will shoot him down. Check Enrico's body for the HEXAGONAL
CRANK. Take it and go back to the Typewriter Corridor, but watch out
for the hunters which found their way down here.

TYPEWRITER CORRIDOR

Go past the typewriter until you come to a hole in the floor. Now use
your new Crank in that hole in the wall to clear up the path (is THAT
possible? And, even if it were, it's still the most absurd thing in
the whole game, believe me. Who on Earth would take the time to build
such a stupid device?).
Now you can reach the door.

FIRST BOULDER CORRIDOR

Go ahead until you come to a boulder blocking the way. Now turn
around and RUN!!! You must reach the doorway before the rolling
boulder gets you. I think you don't need me to guess what happens if
you don't make it. Anyway, the boulder will open a new path (this
place is full of absurd things...), where a door and a hunter are
waiting for you. If you go where the boulder was previously standing,
you'll find some FLAME ROUNDS - but a hunter will enter the room,
giving you too much trouble for what you get. Whatever you do, open
that new door.

SPIDERWEB ROOM

There's a HUGE spider here. It will spit poison at you, but it's too
slow for you, so just run in circles and shoot when you're behind it,
and it'll be dead in no time. Get out to get rid of the little ones,
then come back in and use the Flame Rounds to destroy the webs on the
door. If you don't have the Bazooka with you, just pick up the COMBAT
KNIFE in the corner and use that. There's also an INK RIBBON in this
room, it's in the other corner in the same screen where you get the
Knife. Now open the door.

EMPTY CORRIDOR

No one here. Go east to find a door, and open it.

OFFICE

An INK RIBBON, a F.AID SPRAY, a BLUE HERB, a typewriter, and an item
storage box. Put the Square Crank in the box and make sure you have
the Eagle Medal and two empty slots in your inventory. Go back to the
corridor and go open the door at its other end.

SECOND BOULDER CORRIDOR

Go right and ahead until you find another hole in the floor. Use the
Hex Crank three times so that the hole is on the left wall. Now go
tease the boulder, and run to the alcove you've just created. After
the boulder has passed, go to the end of the corridor to find the MAP
OF UNDERGROUND and the DOOM BOOK 2, which holds the WOLF MEDAL. Now
open the door in the alcove.

PRESSURE PLATE ROOM

Go to the statue and push it towards the door, but stop when it's
between the hexagonal hole and the east wall. Use the Crank and a
small section of the wall will pop out, pushing the statue on its
way. If it misses the statue, reposition it and try again. Now use
the Crank again, and you will be able to push the statue on the
pressure plate on the floor. This will open the nook containing the
LAB KEY. Now go back to the corridor and reach its other end to find
the elevator. Take it up.

FOUNTAIN

Those huge double doors lead to the Heliport, but they cannot be
opened. There are two GREEN HERBS and two BLUE ones here. Now look at
the fountain. There are three tombstone-like parts in it. Use the
Wolf Medal on the West one and the Eagle Medal on the East one. A FMV
will show you a new path. It leads to an elevator. Use it to access
the final building in the game.


                        ---------------------
                        UMBRELLA'S SECRET LAB
                        ---------------------


ENTRANCE

Just descend the ladder.

STORAGE BOX ROOM

Take the MO Disk with you, and one or two weapons. You'll also need
the Lab Key. Now keep going.

STAIRWELL

There are three zombies here, and 2 GREEN HERBS. The other door is
locked, but on the table nearby you'll find some SLIDES. Just leave
them here now, and climb the stairs down.

GREAT CORRIDOR

In this corridor you'll meet the naked zombies, probably escaped from
the morgue in the center of the room. If you go straight ahead from
the stairs, you'll find a hole in the wall. An INK RIBBON is hidden
there. Now open the door near the stairs.

PASS CODE CORRIDOR

Open the door on the South wall.

JOHN'S ROOM

Kill the zombie and turn on the light. Read the RESEARCHER'S LETTER
on the desk VERY CAREFULLY. You'll also find a CLIP in the box near
the sink, and a GREEN HERB. Now push aside the big shelf to find a
switch, but don't push it just now. Go to the painting and examine
it. Take note of the words and their disposition, then go to the
switch and push it. Examine the painting again: now you should be
able to decipher the password found in the Researcher's Letter. Now
go back to the Great Corridor and go straight from the door. Avoid
the zombie and make it to the other door. Open it.

COMPUTER ROOM

Search the room for a MO DISK. Now go to the computer and turn it on.
Input JOHN for ID, and ADA as the password. Now choose to unlock the
doors on floor B3 first, then choose B2 and you'll be asked to enter
another password. Input the password you found in the Researcher's
Letter. Now go back upstairs, take the Slides, and open the
previously locked door.

VISUAL DATA ROOM

Check the shelf on the right to find the SECURITY SYSTEM manual. Use
the Slides in the projector on the table to take a look at the
monsters - and to the Umbrella R&D team (humans, but still monsters,
indeed). Now open the panel on the wall and push the switch, and a
column will slide sidewards. Take the MO DISK that was behind it and
go back downstairs. Enter the Pass Code Corridor and open the door
opposite John's Room.

LAB STOREROOM

There are 5 zombies here. There's a FAX in a nook in the wall, and an
INK RIBBON in a box on the floor. Use a MO Disk in the pass code
output machine on the desk to receive the PASS CODE 01. Now return to
the Great Corridor and make your way to the door in the SE corner.
Unlock it and discard the P.Room Key, then open the door.

ELEVATOR CORRIDOR

There are 2 zombies here, but just open the nearest door for the
moment.

AUTOPSY ROOM

You'll find some SHELLS, and a RED HERB in the sink. Fortunately, the
new camera angle makes the puzzle in this room much easier. There are
two boxes and a ladder. Push the ladder to the left so that you can
push the right box on the right hole. Now push the left box until
it's in the same spot where the other one was, then push the ladder
near the right wall. Push the box on the left hole and, finally, push
the ladder between the boxes. If the holes weren't properly covered,
poison gas will fill the room. If they were, climb to the ventilation
shaft and go through it.

MORGUE

The two zombies lying on the floor aren't dead, so you'll have to
kill at least the one blocking the way to the MAGNUM ROUNDS on the
shelf. In this room you can also use a MO Disk to get the PASS CODE
02. Now unlock the door and you'll be near the door to the Elevator
Corridor - where you should go right now. When you're there, go
straight ahead to find the Guardpost.

GUARDPOST

The last save room holds an INK RIBBON, a BLUE HERB, and some FLAME
ROUNDS. Be sure to have the last MO Disk with you, and one free slot
in your inventory. Saving the game would be a nice idea. When you're
ready, get out and open the south door.

FIRST POWER ROOM

There are three chimeras in this room, so be very careful. Go west
and south to reach the control panel, and activate it. Now go back to
the door and take the other passage to reach a door. Be FAST.

SECOND POWER ROOM

No enemies here! Go straight to find the pass code machine for the
PASS CODE 03, then go back and take the other passage to find a new
door.

THIRD POWER ROOM

This is probably the most dangerous room in the lab. It's better to
cross it clockwise. On its east side there's a switch to restore
power to the elevator, push it. The chimeras will swarm around you
like crazy, but if you're not good at aiming, you'd better keep
running. There's a BATTERY on the floor near the SW corner - take it,
then make it back to the Elevator Corridor.

ELEVATOR CORRIDOR

Push the switch near the elevator to activate it. Barry will join
you, and together the two of you will take the elevator down.

CORRIDOR B4

Everything will finally be clear in this corridor. Wesker will
explain to you the whole thing, then he will try to lead you to the
next room, but Barry will knock him out from behind. After some more
chitchat, you'll go to the next room.

TYRANT LAB

Barry wants to kill the "ultimate biological weapon", and he thinks
the best way to do it is to let it loose. He's gonna pay for that ;).
Now you have to face the Tyrant, which is VERY easy to beat. Get some
distance, then turn around and shoot. Keep doing this until it falls.
Now check Barry and be surprised - he's even tougher than he looks!
All you have to do now is to get out of the room.

CORRIDOR B4

Wesker has activated the triggering system. Now you have to reach the
Pass Code Corridor, but be prepared to run because the chimeras are
now infesting the Great Corridor. Save if you want.

PASS CODE CORRIDOR

Check the pass code machine and you'll automatically use the three
Pass Codes. Open the door.

PRISON CORRIDOR

Reach and open the door at the other end.

PRISON

Chris Redfield is here. Get out with him and he'll leave you behind
as soon as you're back in the Pass Code Corridor. Now go upstairs.

STAIRWELL

Kill the three new zombies, then go to the Storage Box Room.

STORAGE BOX ROOM

Put in the box everything but the Battery, the Colt, the Magnum
Rounds, and any healing item you have, then climb up the ladder.

ENTRANCE

Open the huge doors.

HELIPORT PASSAGE

Run until you reach the elevator, and put the Battery in place
(you'll receive a radio call from Brad). There are three minutes
until the explosion. Barry and Chris will take care of the monsters
that are following you. Get on the elevator.

HELIPORT

Pick up the FLARE from the nearby box. You can use it anywhere, but
it's best to use it on the H painted on the floor. You'll see Brad's
helicopter fly overhead, but after a moment there will be an
explosion and the Tyrant will burst through the floor and come at
you.

This battle is quite hard. If you are too far from it, the Tyrant
will charge you and swipe at you with its oversized claw. This attack
is incredibly powerful, and it's even more if you get knocked against
a wall. Therefore, it's best not to take too much distance from the
monster. Check your health every time you're hit, and shoot when you
can - or just survive until the timer reaches 00'30". At that point,
or if you've done enough damage, Brad will drop a ROCKET LAUNCHER on
the big H on the floor. Take it and kill the Tyrant. If you miss with
all four bullets (which I SERIOUSLY doubt), you're dead. If you kill
the monster, you've completed the game.

8. CHRIS' WALKTHROUGH
=====================================================================

***NOTE: I will explain Chris' walkthrough assuming that you have
already played the game as Jill Valentine, and therefore that you
know the layout of the buildings pretty well. This walkthrough will
only marginally cover the optional areas and the possible variations
in the development of the adventure (i.e., the different situations
in which Chris meets Rebecca), since Chris' game is very hard, not
only because of the number and the strength of the monsters, but for
the extremely limited inventory, too. If you need to save more often
than suggested, feel free to collect more Ink Ribbons, but store them
immediately. Also, the usage of the Green Herbs is at your complete
disposal for most of the game. Just remember you have limited space
for your items. The variables of the adventure can be found in the
Endings and Secrets section.***


                           ----------------
                           MANSION - PART I
                           ----------------


MAIN HALL 1F

Barry is gone. Someone fires a gun somewhere in the house, and Chris
decides to go and check. He leaves and goes to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM

Nothing to do here. Open the door at the other end of the room.

SOFA CORRIDOR

Go left and a FMV will introduce to you your first zombie. Don't try
to be a hero and to kill it with that ridiculous knife - just turn
around and go back to the Main Hall.

MAIN HALL 1F

Jill and Wesker are gone, too! What's wrong with this place?! There
seems to be no answer right now, so the best thing to do is to pick
up Jill's BERETTA from the floor. Now return to the Sofa Corridor.

SOFA CORRIDOR

The zombie is on the right. Turn around and shoot it until it's dead.
If it falls down but it's still alive, use the knife to stab it while
it's on the floor to save some much precious ammo. When it's dead, go
search Kenneth's body for two invaluable CLIPS. Now go back to the
Main Hall and climb the stairs to the second floor.

MAIN HALL 2F

Go to the Balcony Passage.

BALCONY PASSAGE

Pick up that shining SMALL KEY, then go to the Balcony.

BALCONY

Pick up the CLIP near Forest's body, then try to pick up the key.
Forest will attack you. Turn around and run back to the door, and
shoot him from there. After he's gone for good, pick up the ARMOR KEY
and go back to Main Hall 2F.

MAIN HALL 2F

Go to the Red Corridor.

RED CORRIDOR

Open the first door you'll find.

RICHARD'S ROOM

Rebecca Chambers is guarding a poisoned Richard Aiken. Rebecca will
ask you to go and search for the Serum. Chris will automatically get
out of the room and the map will be shown. The red-flashing room is
your goal. Return to the Main Hall 2F and open the double doors, but
watch out for the zombie that is now lurking near the door of the Red
Corridor.

*********************************************************************
Rebecca can be met in the Infirmary if you go there first, but
there's no point in doing this. If you meet her there, Richard will
be dead by the time you get here. In that case, search him for the
RADIO.
*********************************************************************

DINING ROOM 2F

Immediately shoot the nearest zombie until it's dead. Now equip the
Combat Knife and start pushing the statue towards the opening in the
rail. When the zombie reaches the statue, stay behind the statue and
stab him with the Knife. He won't be able to get to you, so kill him
with the blade to spare some most wanted ammo. Then make the statue
fall to the room below, and ignore the third zombie. Reach the other
door and open it.

NARROW CORRIDOR

Be ready to kill the zombie, because it's insanely close to the door.
The second one is just round the corner, while the third should be no
problem. Go downstairs.

WOODEN CORRIDOR

A cerberus will break the nearest window and come to you - kill it
and enter the Infirmary.

INFIRMARY

Put into the box the Knife, the F.Aid Spray, and the Small Key. Take
the SERUM from the shelf and go back to Richard's Room.

*********************************************************************
You can store the Serum into the box for later use. Should you do
that, skip the next passage.
*********************************************************************

RICHARD'S ROOM

You give the Serum to Rebecca, but unfortunately it's too late for
Richard. He will give you the RADIO before dying. Rebecca will stay
here for a bit longer. Now go back to the Red Corridor and open the
next door. Remember there are two more zombies in the Corridor.

ARMORS' ROOM

You'd expect that Chris' game would include some animated armors
ready to impale you, wouldn't you? Well, at least they weren't THAT
cruel. Cover the two holes with the two statues, then press the
switch and collect the EMBLEM. Now get out and proceed to the end of
the corridor. Enter the Library.

LIBRARY

Yeah, I know, this is not really a library, but there are some books,
so let's assume it is a library, OK? ;). Read the BOTANY BOOK found
on the table, then unlock and open the door.

CORRIDOR 2F

Kill the two zombies and open the door in the middle of the corridor.

STAG ROOM

Go to the Aquarium Room.

AQUARIUM ROOM

Read the remaining part of the RESEARCHER'S WILL on the desk. Push
the switch on the wall, between the spiders, to drain the aquarium.
Push it aside, and push the cupboard toward the wall. Collect the
first half of the MOON CREST. There's an INK RIBBON in the white coat
near the door, but don't take it now. Get out and go to the Bedroom,
but beware of the zombie.

BEDROOM

There's a RED HERB near the left bed, and a box of SHELLS between the
right bed and the wall, but don't take them now. Get the LIGHTER from
the shelf instead, and return to the Corridor 2F.

CORRIDOR 2F

Your inventory should be full, so go downstairs.

STAIRWELL

Avoid the two zombies and enter the Storage Room.

STORAGE ROOM

Put the Emblem and the Crest into the box, then return upstairs and
go to Richard's Room - but remember to collect the Shells from the
Bedroom before you go there. You can go to the Fireplace Room to get
the MAP OF SECOND FLOOR; if you do so, be warned that a zombie is
hiding behind the corner at the end of the corridor.

RICHARD'S ROOM

Use the GREEN HERBS if you need to heal, then open the door to the
Attic Passage.

ATTIC PASSAGE

Kill the two zombies FAST, then go to the Candle Room.

CANDLE ROOM

Light the candle with the Lighter. Collect the CLIP from the left
cupboard, then push the right one aside. Enter the secret passage to
get the SWORD KEY. Now go straight back to the Infirmary.

INFIRMARY

Store the Shells and the Lighter, and take the Small Key with you.
Now get out and run to the Weapon Room. Don't stop to fight the dogs.

WEAPON ROOM

Open the desk for some Shells. Take the COLT PYTHON from the shelf
and equip it(!!). Take the CLIP, too. Get out and go to the Green
Corridor.

GREEN CORRIDOR

Use the Python to blast the two zombies. Unlock and enter the
Keeper's Room.

KEEPER'S ROOM

Take the CLIP on the bed. Go check the desk and kill the zombie which
will surprise attack you. Get the SHELLS from the cupboard, and read
the KEEPER'S DIARY. Now go back to the Infirmary, killing the
cerberuses on your way back there. Use all your Magnum Rounds if
required.

INFIRMARY

Store the Python and the Shells. Go back to the Green Corridor and
unlock the door to the Sofa Corridor. Go to the Piano Bar.

PIANO BAR

Get round the piano, push the shelf aside, and take the MUSIC NOTES
you'll find. Use them on the piano and Rebecca will enter the room.
She will try to play, but she won't do it very well. She will ask you
to let her practice for a while. Whatever the answer, she will stay
and practice. Go to Main Hall 1F.

MAIN HALL 1F

Unlock the Globe Room, but don't get in. Open the blue double doors.

STATUE ROOM

Push the ladder below the statue and climb it to collect the MAP OF
FIRST FLOOR. Don't bother going into the passage for the INK RIBBON -
it would be a waste of time and bullets. Unlock the L-Shaped Corridor
and discard the Sword Key, then open the door.

L-SHAPED CORRIDOR

Walk backwards so that you're ready to shoot the cerberus. After
you've killed it, go on and kill the second. Push the shelf aside and
pick up the CLIP that was under it. Proceed.

TWISTED CORRIDOR

Unlock the Patio and discard the Armor Key. Enter the Patio.

PATIO

Kill the cerberus. Get round the corner and a second one will attack
you. Kill it. Make full use of the 5 GREEN HERBS if you need to, then
collect the CHEMICAL and get out without stopping to kill the third
dog. Go to the Bathroom.

BATHROOM

Kill the zombie. Take the CLIP near the mirror, and the SMALL KEY
from the bathtub. Now go to the Dark Corridor.

DARK CORRIDOR

Kill the first two zombies. If the third one attacks you, avoid it.
Go to the Painting Gallery.

PAINTING GALLERY

Push the switches below the pictures in this order:

-Newborn baby
-Infant
-Lively boy
-Young man
-Middle-aged man
-Old man
-"The end of life"

Get the WIND CREST and leave. Unlock the door to the Stairwell and
open it.

STAIRWELL

Kill the two zombies this time, then enter the Storage Room.

STORAGE ROOM

Store the Wind Crest. Take the BROKEN SHOTGUN and go to the Shotgun
Room.

SHOTGUN ROOM

Kill the zombie closest to the door (but you can avoid it if you're
smart) and run to the SHOTGUN. Take it and kill the other two zombies
(or three, if you did avoid the first one). Put the Broken Shotgun on
the wall and get back to the Storage Room. Store the Beretta and the
Clips, take the Shells and the Emblem, and go back to Main Hall 1F.

MAIN HALL 1F

Go to the Globe Room.

GLOBE ROOM

Kill the zombies and open the desk for some SHELLS. You can go to the
Mirror Room and the Change Room if you want - in that case, you'll
find a zombie, two GREEN HERBS, an INK RIBBON, and two new costumes.
When you're done, take the INK RIBBON near the typewriter in the Main
Hall if you don't have one, then go to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM

Take the STAR CREST from the broken statue, then go to the Piano Bar.

PIANO BAR

Rebecca will play the Moonlight Sonata, and a secret passage will
open. Go there and take the GOLD EMBLEM. Replace it with the Wooden
one, then go back to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM

Put the Gold Emblem into the hollow on the wall. The clock will slide
sidewards, revealing the BLUE JEWEL. Take it and go to the Tiger
Room.

TIGER ROOM

Put the Blue Jewel in the tiger's eye, and take the SHIELD KEY. Go to
the Greenhouse, killing the zombie on the way.

GREENHOUSE

Use the Chemical in the pumping machine to stun the plant. Collect
the SUN CREST. Go to the Infirmary, store the Crests, and save your
game. Now go to the Attic. You are free to fill your inventory with
healing items since you'll enter the Attic with one free slot anyway.
Bring the Serum if you saved it earlier.

ATTIC

Discard the Shield Key before you enter. Walk to the middle of the
room and Yawn will come out of its hole to face you. For some reason,
I've found it easier to defeat it than in Jill's scenario. You should
need EXACTLY seven Shells to end the fight. Be sure to pick up the
ones found in this room after the fight, and get the second half of
the MOON CREST from Yawn's lair. Use the Serum if you have it, and go
to the Storage Room; otherwise, just leave the Attic.

ATTIC PASSAGE

As soon as he descends the steps, Chris will start feeling sick.
Rebecca will come in and he will tell her he's poisoned, so she will
go for the Serum. Now you'll have to control Rebecca. Go to the
Infirmary, get the Serum, and come back here. It should be really
easy. When you're back, Rebecca will give Chris a shot and he will be
fine. Check his health though, because the last time I played I
didn't, and a zombie killed me with the first bite. Go to the Storage
Room.

*********************************************************************
You won't be able to play as Rebecca if you didn't deliver the Serum
to Richard. Should Chris pass out, you'll awake in the Infirmary.
*********************************************************************

STORAGE ROOM

The only things you need are the Shotgun, the Shells, and the four
Crests (that's as much as you can take with you anyway). Take them
and go to the Courtyard Passage, but beware of the third zombie in
the Dark Corridor - he's still there, provided you didn't kill it
before (I didn't tell you to... why shouldn't he be there? ;) ).

COURTYARD PASSAGE

It's important that you hit both cerberuses with the same shell every
time you shoot, or you'll waste too much ammo. When they're dead, use
the Crests to unlock the door, and open it.

WAREHOUSE

Push the ladder below the high shelf and climb it to find the SQUARE
CRANK. Go to the Courtyard.


                                ------
                                GARDEN
                                ------


COURTYARD

Try not to use too many shells to kill the three cerberuses. You'll
get a radio call from Brad Vickers, but he won't be able to hear you,
so just keep going.

POOL

Use the Crank to lower the water, and cross the water passage. Run to
the elevator to avoid the snakes, and take the elevator down.

WATERFALL COURTYARD

If you're good enough to dodge all the dogs, do it - otherwise, waste
them. Proceed to the Guardhouse Passage.

GUARDHOUSE PASSAGE

Kill the first dog, but dodge the others - you should be dying for
ammo by now.


                              ----------
                              GUARDHOUSE
                              ----------


MAIN CORRIDOR

Use the statue to cover the hole in the floor, and enter the
Dormitory 001.

DORMITORY 001

Kill the 2 zombies. There's a SMALL KEY in a cup on the small table
near the cupboard - take it and open the desk for some much needed
SHELLS. Don't enter the Bathroom 001 - go to the Bar instead.

BAR

I suggest that you don't waste a single Shell on those spiders. Take
the RED BOOK and get out - it's too dangerous to go and check the
code on the pool table (but you can do it if you're fast). Go to the
Long Corridor.

LONG CORRIDOR

Use the three GREEN HERBS at the end of the corridor if you need
them, then go to the Wasp Nest Room.

WASP NEST ROOM

Get the DORMITORY KEY 002 below the wasp nest and run outta here.
Unlock the Dormitory and discard the key.

DORMITORY 002

No zombies here (whew!). Read the PLANT 42 REPORT on the bed, and
take the MAP OF DORMITORY from the wall. Enter the Bathroom 002.

BATHROOM 002

Kill the two zombies and grab the DORM.KEY 003 from the sink. Go to
that room, unlock it, and get inside.

DORMITORY 003

Kill the zombie, then read the "V-JOLT" REPORT and replace it with
the Red Book. Go to the Bathroom 003.

BATHROOM 003

Kill the zombie and collect the CLIP. Now go to the Bedroom.

BEDROOM

The guys at CAPCOM must be crazy... they've replaced those Explosive
Rounds with a CLIP!!! Anyway, store the Shotgun and the Shells. No,
I'm not crazy, at least not as much as them. Store the Crank as well.
Take the Beretta and the Clips with you. You should have at least 30
bullets. Now go to Plant 42 Room.

PLANT 42 ROOM

Chris is too curious... he wants to take a close look at the jumbo
plant, but it grabs him with a vine! Luckily, Rebecca hears Chris
screaming and rushes in (through a JAMMED door... drives me mad!). He
drops the "V-JOLT" REPORT for her to use. Now you'll be in control of
Rebecca once more. Go to the Chemical Room. The entry code in my last
game was 1-2-5, but it's probably subject to change. Get inside.

CHEMICAL ROOM

Pick up three EMPTY BOTTLES and do the following mixes:

Water + UMB No.2 = NP-003
NP-003 + UMB No.4 = UMB No.7
UMB No.2 + UMB No.4 = Yellow-6
UMB No.7 + Yellow-6 = UMB No. 13
UMB No.13 + NP-003 = V-JOLT

Now go to the Dormitory 002.

DORMITORY 002

Push the left cupboard towards the wall, and push the left one
sidewards to reveal a ladder. Climb it down.

UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

Use the crates to create a bridge, cross it, and enter the Aquarium
Room. From there, go to the Roots Room.

ROOTS ROOM

Use the V-Jolt on the roots and they'll shrink. Get out and you'll
regain control of Chris.

PLANT 42 ROOM

The plant shrinks and drops Chris, but then grows big again. Now
equip the Beretta and fight! The handgun is fast and allows you to
aim very high, striking the plant's core. Just don't stay in the same
spot for too long - shoot two or three bullets, then move to avoid
the acid. It will take about 30 bullets to kill it. When you're done,
pick up the C.ROOM KEY from the fireplace and go to the Aquarium Room
(you'll have a short chitchat with Rebecca in the Wasp Nest Room.

AQUARIUM ROOM

No FMV for Chris - instead, you may find the Neptunes waiting for you
right in front of the Control Room door! Well, go as fast as you can
and enter that room, and don't forget to discard the key.

CONTROL ROOM

Lower the water level and unlock the next room, then go there.

ARSENAL

Get the two boxes of SHELLS and the HELMET KEY, but leave the CLIPS
where they are. Go to the Roots Room.

ROOTS ROOM

Pick up the SMALL KEY from the box near the roots, and go back to the
Dormitory 002.

DORMITORY 002

Open the desk for a box of SHELLS.

LONG CORRIDOR

Wesker is here. After a dialogue, he will leave. Go to the Bedroom.

BEDROOM

Store the Beretta forever. Save your game. Go back to the Mansion,
and don't kill the two cerberuses in the Courtyard yet. You'll get a
radio call from Brad after leaving the Guardhouse.


                          -----------------
                          MANSION - PART II
                          -----------------


DARK CORRIDOR

Now you're about to face the hardest part of the game. You need to
hear every single sound the hunters make, so turn up the volume of
your TV. When the first hunter comes towards you, raise the Shotgun
and shoot. You'll hear the thud it makes when it falls on the floor.
Soon you'll hear another thud, meaning the hunter is back on its
feet. Now it's time to shoot again. Repeat until it's dead. Sound is
very important here, because the camera angles give you a great
disadvantage against these monsters. Now unlock the Study and get in.

STUDY

Find the switch on the desk and turn on the lamp. Take the MAGNUM
ROUNDS and the MO DISK, then go to the Stairwell.

STAIRWELL

Switch to the next camera angle and position yourself so that you can
shoot the first hunter. You should be able to shoot one at a time
until they're dead. It should take you a full box of Shells -
sometimes even more. Now read Wesker's note and enter the Storage
Room.

STORAGE ROOM

Thanks for the SHELLS and the F.AID SPRAY, Wesker, but why that CLIP?
Anyway, it's time for some serious killings. Have with you the
Shotgun, the Shells, the Colt Python (load it with those newfound
Rounds), the Helmet Key, and any healing item. Now you must reach the
Trophy Room, but it's important that you DON'T reach it via the
second floor, because the Red Corridor is incredibly dangerous and
the Dining Room and the Narrow Corridor are LETHAL. First though,
leave this room and climb the nearby stairs.

CORRIDOR 2F

Don't climb those steps! Face them, then raise the Shotgun. Chris
will aim at that hunter in the corridor. Now, aim up and shoot. The
monster will get quite mad and try to reach you, but it can't climb
down the steps! Kill it from below, then go back and to the Twisted
Corridor.

TWISTED CORRIDOR

One hunter is lurking near the other door, but it's pretty stupid and
you should be able to dodge its attack. Go on.

L-SHAPED CORRIDOR

Run and the two spiders will do you no harm. Go on until you reach
the Green Corridor, and be aware that two spiders are waiting in the
Sofa Corridor.

GREEN CORRIDOR

Equip the Colt and aim straight ahead. After a few seconds, the first
hunter will spot you and come to you, probably with a giant leap.
Shoot it - two Rounds will be more than enough. The second will then
attack you. Use the same strategy. The third one is usually lurking
in the small alcove leading to the Tiger Room, so you may have to
lure it out. Sometimes he will take initiative and attack. It's
important that you kill them all. Try to use all the Magnum Rounds
you have, then go to the Wooden Corridor.

WOODEN CORRIDOR

There are two hunters here, but all you want is to make it to the
second floor, so just dodge them and climb the stairs at the end of
the hall.

NARROW CORRIDOR

Immediately unlock and enter the Trophy Room.

TROPHY ROOM

Read the ORDERS on the table. Take the MAGNUM ROUNDS and load the
Colt, then pick up the SHELLS. Now, push the ladder below the moose
head, and turn off the light. Climb the ladder and take the RED
JEWEL, then leave and go back downstairs.

WOODEN CORRIDOR

Kill the first
