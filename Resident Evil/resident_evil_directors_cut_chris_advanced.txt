  Finally,I've gotten around to writing this FAQ.Lets get down to buiseness,Chris
 can only carry 6 items,so I leave it up to you to decide when to visit a stor.room.
 Chris can take more hits than Jill,so its better to take a beating and heal yourself
 than to lose ammo.You'll notice some of this FAQ is cut and paste from my Jill FAQ,such
 as the enemy and weapon section.But Chris's game varies from Jill's more than you think
 so don't think this is all cut and paste when it is 80 percent new.This FAQ is made
 so that you can beat it in under 3 hours.So I may leave out something I deam unimportant.
 I'll take any questions you may have at skultera@aol.com...
VERSION 1.5=I've updated alot of the information in this FAQ.
VERSION 2=I've fixed up some stuff added a new section and updated my email address.
 I had to change my screen name for certain reasons.So I came back to fix up this FAQ.

FEEDBACK
  Well I must have got a million emails on this FAQ which is to say quite unexpected.
Half those million questions asked where the helmet key was.?!?!?Did they not read this FAQ.
Its in this FAQ so read this time.I also got a ton of emails about me saying the game is called
advanced and there's is called Arrange.?!?My copy says advanced so I stick by that!Yes arrange 
and advance are the same game.I also received a few emails on the picture puzzle.Thanx for 
telling me guys,I fixed the prob.Oh wait there was no prob.If you don't follow this walkthru
directly expect the game to be a little different.If I feel your questions are answered in
the FAq I WILL NOT RPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE!So if your having trouble check out my web page.

THE ENEMIES
  One of the greatest strategies is to know the enemy.
**the zombie**The slowest and easiest of all enemies in the game.These enemies are easier to
dodge rather than fight.
**dogs**Fast and deadly they should be taken out quick before they take out you.
**hunters**even more deadly then the dogs.The hunters is an enemy I hate to encounter.I usually
just dodge them.But its best to kill them using the colt python or acid rounds.
**chimeras**They hang out in the power room deep in the lab.They walk on the ceiling and swoop
down at an enemy.Just fire a shot up to knock them down.Then aim down and kill em.
**crows**Do not bother to kill them,just run.You'll save plenty of ammo.
**snakes**Don't bother to kill them either.
**bees**same here just run.
**Super zombies**They are only found in the lab,their super strong and super naked.It only
takes about 3 attacks for them to kill you so beware.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
3)
THE WEAPONS
  Every enemy has a weak spot.Even the bully down the street.
**The Beretta**You start with this.Its best at taking out dogs and zombies earlier in the game.
if you like to save ammo use this alot.
**The Shotgun**The best for killing zombies.Wait until the zombies are in close range and blow 
there heads off.
**The Combat Knife**The weakest weapon in the entire game.I don't even bother to use it.Its only
good when you have no ammo.
**The bazooka**Only Jill will get this.It has 3 different kinds of ammo.Acid,Explosive,and Flame
each good for taking out certain enemies.
**The Colt Python**The strongest weapon in the game(except for the rocket launcher)Its specialty
is killin Hunters in 1 or 2 shots.
**The Rocket Launcher**It claims to kill any enemy in one shot.I'll tell you now that thats a
total lie.It takes plenty of shots to kill the snake with it.And plenty of shots to kill all
the other bosses.Except for Tyrant this is the only boss it kills in one shot.But don't get
me wrong its still the strongest weapon.
**Flame Thrower**Only Chris can get the flame thrower.Its not a good weapon because you can only
use it underground and there is no refill.

**THE BEGINNING**
 Pick Chris and watch the cool beginning.Well it ain't all that cool,its filmed like
a B movie.The STARS team is sent to Raccoon Forest to search for the missing Bravo team.
They see there plane and land.While investigating the area and while beast attacks them.Joseph
Frost is quickly killed and the others are forced to run.The remaining STARS members take 
shelter in an abandon mansion which appears to be safe.Yet....

go back to the bee room and enter 003.Take the white book off the shelf and read about V-JOLT.

begin what I call the death hold.Rebecca will walk in at the knick of time.It up to her to make 
V-JOLT to save Chris.Go to the room that was electronically locked.Here's the file to help
you make V-JOLT.

"V-Jolt Report"

   As I stated in the last report,there are some common features found in the
 cells of the plant infected by the Tyrant virus.We also have found another
 interesting fact through some experiments.
   We found an element that destroys these plant cells rapidly in "UMB no.16"
 one of the series of UMB chemicals that we used for that experiment.We named
 the "UMB no.16" as "V-JOLT".
   In our calculation,it will take less then 5 seconds to destroy Plant42 if
 we put the "V-Jolt" directly on the root.You need to mix some of the UMB series
 chemicals in a specific order to create "V-Jolt".But the UMB series chemical
 may generate a poisonous gas which is harmful to the human body.Extreme caution
 should be taken when handling the chemicals.
   Following are the types of UMB series chemicals and their brief characteristics.
 
 UMB NO.2 RED       NP-003 PURPLE
 UMB NO.4 GREEN     YELLOW-6 YELLOW
 UMB NO.7 WHITE  
 UMB NO.13 BLUE(stimulating smell)
 V-JOLT(UMB NO.16) BROWN

 Ok,OK I'll guide you threw it.First take the 4 containers,fill 1 with water and the other with
UMB NO.2.Fill another with UMB NO.4.Mix them in this order:water,no.2,no.4.Fill one container
with UMB NO.2 and one with UMB NO.4.Mix them.Then mix the UMB 6 and 7 to make 13.Get water and
UMB NO.2,mix them to get 3.The mix 3 and 13 to make V-JOLT.Once you have go to 002 and go to the
basement.Push the crates around to make a bridge over the water.Go through the door.Turn to 
Rebecca's right immediately.Go through the door and pour V-JOLT on the roots.Exit the room.

BOSS FIGHT:PLANT 42
Suggested Weapon:Beretta w/2-3clips
 You'll gain control of Chris right away.Unload about 5 shots into the plant and run,stop,and
fire again.Repeat until the plant shrivels again.Take the C.ROOM KEY from the fire place.
Exit the room.You'll meet Rebecca again.Exit the room.

"WESKER...YOUR ALIVE?!"
  Go to 002.And down into the basement.Continue and go through the door.Find the control room
and open it.Drain the water and unlock the room next door.Go to the room next door.Take the 
2 clips and 2 shells.Make sure to take the HELMET KEY.Go back to the save room.On the way
you'll meet up with Wesker.Continue to the save room.Take the Shotgun,Shells and Helmet key
with you and go back to the mansion.

  Now go to the main hall then upstairs to the red hall.Continue this way to the storage room
by there.Its a good idea to save the game.Take the battery,crank,and magnum.Go back to the
courtyard.Run through the courtyard until you reach the 3rd area(there should be an elevator
with no battery).Put the battery in place.Go up the elevator.Run back to where you used the 
crank.Use the crank to stop the water.Then run back to the new elevator and travel down.Where
the water once flowed should be a ladder.Go down it.
