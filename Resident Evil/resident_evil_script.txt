*PURPOSE OF THIS FAQ*
------------------------------------

This FAQ has been written in order to provide a complete reference
of what has been said by the characters in the Resident Evil world. 
In finding continuity errors and the like, what the characters say is
extremely important. But because the first Resident Evil has so many
different alternate paths, many people never see many of the scenes
within this game. Also, some people may not own the game, and want
to be filled in on what happened within the first game. This FAQ and a
File FAQ would fill them in on the Storyline of RE1 somewhat near 100%.
It also tries to help reveal what events lead to which scenes later on, a 
topic which some FAQs still aren't totally clear on. This guide tries to be
as clear as possible, telling what is needed to see each scene (unless it is
a scene that is always seen; I speak more of the alternate path scenes.).
I will also eventually be covering the PC version of Resident Evil, with its
"Totally Uncut" cinemas and scenes, since these are things that most 
console gamers may never see. So welcome, into the realm of survival
horror... Resident Evil. By the way, if you find any other cinemas that you
feel should be included in this FAQ, feel free to email me at 
aquasharkd@hotmail.com and tell me about it. Or just talk about Resident
Evil theories. Now on the the FAQ...

*TERMINOLOGY USED IN THIS FAQ*

I. Jill Valentine

A. The Mansion
--------------
Scene 1. Opening FMV
[1998 July]
[Raccoon Forest]
*(Background is a cloudy sky...)*
Chris: Alpha Team is flying around the forest zone, situated in northwest
Raccoon City, where we're searching for the helicopter of our compatriots
Bravo Team, who disappeared during the middle of our mission.
[Background Talk:
Wesker: Chris, you haven't found it?
Chris: No, I haven't found it yet.]

*(Changes to picture of Newspaper--"Raccoon Times--Bizarre murders committed
in Raccoon City." Then to "HORROR IN RACCOON! MORE VICTIMS DEAD." Then to 
"STARS (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) sent to save Raccoon City.", with
 a map of the mountains around Raccoon City.)*

Chris: Bizarre murder cases have recently occured in Raccoon City. There are
outlandish reports of families being attacked by a group of about 10 people.
Victims were apparently eaten. Bravo Team went to the hideout of the group,
and disappeared. 

*(Changes to the cloudy sky once again--but a plume of smoke rises above a 
field with tall grass...)*

Jill: Look, Chris!

*(Changes to Alpha Team walking through the tall grass. They all stop.)*

Chris: It was Bravo Team's helicopter. Nobody was in it. But strangely, most
of the equipment was still there. However, we soon discovered why.

*(View of an evil-looking dog-face, complete with growl noises... View 
switches to Jill and Chris, scouting together... View switches to Joseph,
scouting alone. He raises his hand and tries to grab his team's attention.)*

Joseph: Hey! Come here!

*(Dogs open their drool-covered mouths and growl a bit. View changes back to
Joseph, who carefully reaches down and discovers a severed hand, still
desperately clutching a pistol. He screams and drops it. The dogs bolt over
to him, and the camera zooms in on his terrified eyes as he is ripped apart.
Chris, then the duo of Barry and Wesker, turn to look.
It then switches for a while between the dogs' open mouths and Joseph's own
open mouth, screaming desperately. Jill's face is then seen.)*

Jill: Joseph!

*(A dog charges at Chris, who fires off a few shots from his pistol at it. 
Jill then runs, firing off two shots at the creatures. Three pistol shots
then hit the ground, evidently missing their target. Wesker then shoots 
twice at the creatures while running.)*

Wesker: Hwuh! Waah!

*(Barry then gets one shot off with his Colt Python. What is left of Alpha
team then stops, noticing their helicopter is taking off.)*

Chris: No! Don't go!

*(The helicopter flies off into the horizon, leaving the team standing there.
The dogs then continue their pursuit, leaving Alpha running again. Chris
shoots one of the dogs twice, causing it to groan in pain. Wesker shoots, and
then Chris says...)*

Chris: Jill! Run for that house!

*(After two more pistol shots from Chris, we see a view of an old-looking
mansion... And another of the dog's mouth.)*

[Cast]
[Chris Redfield]
*(Shots of Chris: Turning around in surprise, being skeptical, and shooting
his pistol)*

[Jill Valentine]
*(Jill pops a clip into her Beretta, readies it, and looks at the camera.)*

[Barry Burton]
*(Barry spins around the chamber on his Colt Python, readies it, holds it up,
and looks at the camera.)*

[Rebecca Chambers]
*(Rebecca tightens her bandanna and gives the camera a smile.)*

[Albert Wesker]
*(Wesker slicks his hair back, crosses his arms, and looks cooly at the 
camera.)*

[RESIDENT EVIL]

[They have escaped into the mansion, where they thought it was safe. 
Yet---]

Scene 2. Inside The Mansion
*(Wesker, Barry, and Jill stand in a huge ornate-looking main hall.)*

Barry: What is this?

Wesker: Wow, what a mansion!

*(Jill turns to face Wesker.)*

Jill: Captain Wesker, where's Chris?

*(Jill runs toward the door.)*

Wesker: Stop it! Don't open that door!

Jill: But Chris is--

*(A gunshot is heard. All turn to look in its direction.)*

Barry: What is it?

Wesker: Maybe it's... Chris... (pauses) Now, Jill--Can you go?

Barry: I'm going with you. Chris is our old partner, ya know.

Wesker: Okay. Let me handle this.

*(Barry and Jill nod and walk towards the door on the west...)*

Wesker: Stay alert!

*(Barry and Jill exit.)*

Scene 3. The Dining Room
*(Barry and Jill enter a lavish-looking Dining Room.)*

Barry: A dining room...

*(Barry proceeds to walk to the other end of the room.)*

Scene 4. Mysterious Puddle

*(Barry kneels down near the emblem fireplace.)*

Barry: What? What is this? 

*(Jill walks over.)*

Jill: What is it?

Barry: Blood. (pauses) Jill, see if you can find any other clues. I'll be
examining this. (looks down) Hope this is not Chris's blood...

Scene 5a. Zombie CGI

*(We see a man wearing a green jacket who has a bald, white, diseased-looking
head. He is crouched over another man, apparently eating the poor soul. He
takes a soft bite, then a loud one, which causes a puddle of blood to ooze 
out over the carpet. The zombie then slowly turns his head to look at you
with his cataracted blue eye and bloody lips...)*

Scene 5a-a. Zombie Attack 1

*(Jill heads back out to the dining room. She runs over to Barry.)*

Jill: Barry?

*(The door opens. Barry turns to look at the zombie emerging from it.)*

Barry: What is it?

Jill: Watch out! It's a monster! (begins to back away from the approaching
zombie)

Barry: Let me take care of this.

*(Barry fires his Colt Python 3 times into the zombie's head, popping it on
the last shot. The body falls to the floor with a thump. Barry then walks
over to its corpse and looks down at it.)*

Barry: What IS it?

Jill: Kenneth was killed too; maybe by this creature... (pause) Anyway, let's
report this to Wesker.

*(Barry nods. The room is exited.)*

Scene 5b: Zombie Attack 2 (Semi-Secret)

*(Jill exits the dining room once without investigating. She returns to the
main hall to find Wesker.)*

Wesker: Investigate if you hear any gunfire.

*(Jill acknowledges him and returns to the dining room. She attempts to leave
again. The camera view switches to Barry. He stands up from his crouch.)*

Barry: Lost courage already? It's not like you... (returns to crouching)

*(Jill investigates the old grandfather clock, then goes to talk to Barry. 
Scene 4 is then played out. Once she turns to exit, and runs back to the main
hall, the door to the Tea Room opens. )*

Jill: Who is it?

*(A zombie lurches out and shambles toward Jill. Barry notices and points his
Colt Python toward it.)*

Barry: Hey, you, stop! (pauses as the zombie gets closer to Jill) Run, Jill!
He's insane!

*(Barry fires three shots into the zombie, popping its head on the last one.
He walks over near Jill and the corpse. Barry crouches down.)*

Barry: What the hell?

Jill: Let's report this to Wesker!

*(Barry gets up and they exit.)*

Scene 6: Search for Wesker

*(Barry and Jill enter the Main Hall.)*

Barry: Wesker! (pause) Help me look for him, Jill. And don't leave this hall
for the time being.

*(Jill nods and procceeds to search behind the staircase as Barry walks 
around. She turns back to speak with Barry.)*

Barry: Find anything, Jill?

Jill: (shaking her head) Nothing. What is this all about? I can't figure it
out at all.

Barry: Beats me, too.

Jill: Now it's Wesker's time to disappear! I don't know what's going on.

Barry: Well, it can't be helped. Let's search for him seperately. (Jill nods)
I'll check the dining room again. 

Jill: Okay. I'll try the door on the opposite side.

Barry: This mansion is gigantic. We could get into trouble if we get lost. We
should start from the first floor, okay? And... Jill, here is a lockpick. It
might be handy if you, the master of unlocking, take it with you. (Jill nods)

*(She walks over, and Barry places the lockpick in her hand.)*

Jill: Thanks. Maybe I'll need it.

*(Barry nods and runs toward the dining room door. He stops midway, and
starts to talk to Jill)*

Barry: Listen, if something happens, let's meet up in this hall. 

*(Jill salutes him.)*

Barry: This time, I'll be there.

*(He exits.)*

   a.(O) Cerberus CGI

*(As Jill opens the main hall door, a dog with half of the skin on its head
torn off sticks its head inside the room and growls. Jill shuts it quickly.)*

(O). Ceiling Trap

*(After taking the shotgun, Jill returns to the small anteroom. Strangely,
she hears a *click* come from the doors. The ceiling then begins to descend
on her! After walking around for a while, she stops.)*

Jill: Hey, what's going on? 

*(The camera switches to Barry in the hall. He pounds on the door while 
saying...)*

Barry: Jill? Is that you, Jill? What happened?

*(Camera back on Jill)*

Jill: (frightened) Barry? Help me, please. The door won't open! (pause) 
Quick!

Barry: Stay away from the door, Jill. I'm gonna kick this door down!

*(Barry kicks the door open.)*

Barry: Hurry! This way!

*(Jill runs out, and the ceiling trap descends down to the floor. They are
now in the greenish hallway.)*

Jill: Oh, Barry!

Barry: That was too close. You were almost a Jill sandwich.

Jill: (giggles) You're right! Barry, thanks for saving my life. (pause)
But, Barry, didn't you say you were going back to the dining room to do some
research? Why on earth are you here?

Barry: Uh, I just had something I wanted to check. Now, let's get back to
searching for the lost captain and Chris, shall we?

*(Barry begins to walk off)*

Jill: Thank you, Barry.

Barry: Yeah, yeah...

*(He leaves.)*

Scene 7a. Barry in Terrace

*(2f Terrace. As Jill enters, Barry pulls his gun on her. He retracts it as
he sees who it is. Jill looks shocked.)*

Barry: Jill! (nervous chuckle) Don't scare me. 

Jill: That's what I was going to say. Aren't you supposed to be going over 
the first floor, Barry?

Barry: Yeah, you're right. But just take a look at THIS! 

*(Barry motions at Forest Speyer's corpse. It has been pecked open to the
ribs, and is missing strips of flesh at some places. Barry and Jill walk
over to it.)*

Barry: It's Forest. Oh my God...

*(Switches to a close-up of the corpse.)*

Jill: (turns away) It's awful! 

Barry: I'm going to find out what caused Forest's death. (kneels) It looks
like he was killed by a crow, or something... Can you look around the first
floor, Jill?

Jill: (pauses) Okay.

*(She turns away and begins to walk)*

Barry: Hey, Jill... This must've been Forest's. You don't have a weapon; take
this with you. 

*(Barry gets up and gives the Bazooka to her. He then goes back to the 
corpse.)*

[Extra click: Talk to Barry again. He will shake his head and say:]

Barry: I can't believe...

Scene 7ba. Barry In Main Hall 1f (Note: Must have the Chemical in your
inventory and come back to the main hall; not having seen scene 7a.)

*(Main Hall. First floor.)*

Jill: Barry!

*(They walk over to each other.)*

Barry: Jill! What's going on? Any clues?

Jill: No, but something's wrong with this house.

Barry: Whoah! This hall is dangerous. Maybe it's better to secure our escape
route first. There must be a back door somewhere... Let's try to find *it*
first, shall we?

Jill: (nods) Okay, let's separate again. (turns)

Barry: Just a moment! I've found something. 

Jill: What is it?

Barry: It's a weapon; it's really powerful, especially against living things.
Better take it with you.

Jill: But how about you, Barry?

Barry: (raises his Colt Python) I have THIS!

Jill: Thank you. I'll take this then. (walks over and collects the Acid
Rounds)

*(The two then salute each other, and Barry runs back into the dining room.)*

Scene 7bb. Barry in Main Hall 2f (Note: Must have the Chemical in inventory
and come back to Main Hall 2f, not seeing Scene 7a.)

*(Main Hall; 2nd Floor)*

Jill: Barry!

*(They walk over to each other.)*

Barry: Jill! What's going on? Any clues?

Jill: No, but something's wrong with this house.

Barry: Whoah! This hall is dangerous. Maybe it's better to secure our escape
route first. There must be a back door somewhere... Let's try to find *it*
first, shall we?

Jill: (nods) Okay, let's separate again. (turns)

Barry: Just a moment! I've found something. 

Jill: What is it?

Barry: It's a weapon; it's really powerful, especially against living things.
Better take it with you.

Jill: But how about you, Barry?

Barry: (raises his Colt Python) I have THIS!

Jill: Thank you. I'll take this then. (walks over and collects the Acid
Rounds)

*(The two then salute each other, and Barry runs back into the dining room's
second floor.)*

Scene 8. Researcher's Will Event (Note: This scene will only happen if you go
to the room containing the Will after you've seen Barry on the Terrace, and
before you go see Richard.)

*(Researcher's Room. Jill enters to find Barry standing by a desk. He turns
around, startled.)*

Barry: Is that you, Jill?

*(She salutes him and walks over.)*

Jill: What's going on? How come you look so scared?

Barry: Look at this. (holds out his hand)

*(Jill walks over and gets the file from him. It reads:

RESEARCHER'S WILL
<PAGE>
It's a letter.
The top of the letter is missing.
The remaining says...
<PAGE>
Yes, I'm infected.
I did everything I could, but I
could only delay the progress by
a few days.
The most frightening thing is,
that I forget more about you by
the day.

So I chose a peaceful death,
rather than becoming the living
dead.
<PAGE>
Within an hour, I will have
entered my eternal sleep.
I do hope you'll understand my
decision...

Good Bye and Forever Yours,

             Martin Crackhorn
<END>

Barry: What do you think of it?

Jill: I've been thinking something is wrong with this house.

Barry: Right.

*(Jill looks at the file again.)*

Jill: Hey... What is this? There's a page missing.

Barry: Yeah, I thought about that too. Perhaps that was the most important
part.

*(Barry then leaves the room. He salutes Jill, who returns the salute; then
he exits.)*

Scene 9: Moonlight Sonata

*(Jill uses the Music Notes on the Piano. It says [It's "Moonlight Sonata."]
She plays the piece beautifully. Then a secret trap door opens.)*

Scene 10: Meet Richard

*(Marble Hallway; 2f. Jill walks into the room to see someone lying on the
floor. She walks over to him. It's Richard Aiken from the Bravo Team!)*

Jill: Richard! What happened? (kneels down by Richard's side)

Richard:  Oh Jill... This house... is... dangerous... There are... terrible
demons... Ouch! 

Jill: You're wounded! What kind of demon attacked you?

Richard: It was a huge... snake... and also... poisonous. Ugh...

Jill: Poisonous? Oh no... Richard, hold on!

Richard: There is Serum... (pause) Oh no, I should've brought some with me.

Jill: No problem. I'll go and get it.

Richard: Thanks.

*(Jill then runs out of the room.)*

[Extra Click: Talk to Richard again. He will say...]

Richard: Be careful... (Jill nods.)

Scene 11a. Richard Dies (Note: You must return to Richard in under 15 minutes
to see this cinema.)

*(Marble Hallway; 2f. Jill returns with the Serum. She kneels down by Richard
once again.)*

*(She administers the Serum to Richard.)*

Richard: Jill, here's... my radio... you should... keep it... I'm...

*(He stops moving as blood comes out of his huge wound on his shoulder.)*

Jill: No! Richard!

Richard: Jill... be careful... Uhh... Uh...

*(Richard extends his arm out to Jill, and then he moves no more. He is 
dead. Jill shakes her head and leaves the room.)*

Scene 11b. Richard is Dead (Note: To get this cinema, you must NOT return to
Richard with the Serum for 15-20 minutes.)

*(Marble Room, 2f. Jill kneels down by Richard. The message [Richard is 
dead.] appears. Jill shakes her head. Sad music plays. She doesn't get the
radio.)*

Scene 12: Meet Yawn the Giant Snake

*(2f Attic. After approaching the middle of the room, a huge snake slides out
of a hole in the room's rear. It hisses three times, and proceeds to attack
Jill.)*

*(After shooting it so many times, the snake begins to shiver and proceeds to
slide back into the hole it first came from, leaving Jill free to collect the
Moon Crest.)*

Scene 13a: "Get me Serum" (Note: You must be poisoned by the snake and have
seen cinema 7a.)

*(Jill exits from the 2f Attic. After walking a few steps, she begins to hold

stagger. She leans up against the wall, kneels, and stands up again.)*

Jill: Am I poisoned? Give me the Serum...

*(Jill collapses on the floor. A few seconds later, a door opens, and a man
in black gloves is seen. She reawakens in the 1f West Save Room and slowly
gets up.)*

Jill: (yawns) (sleepily) Barry..? (awake) Barry?

*(Scene ends.)*

B. The Dormitory (Guard House)
------------------------------
Scene 1(P). Radio Transmission #1 (Note: You must have the radio to see this
cinema.)

*(In the first area of the Garden. After killing all the dogs, Jill's Radio 
will begin to beep. She turns it on.)*

Brad: This is Brad. STARS Alpha Team, please respond! What the hell? Is 
nobody out there?

Jill: (into radio) Brad. This is Jill.

Brad: This is Brad... STARS Alpha Team... Bravo Team... It doesn' matter.
Anybody... Answer me... This is Brad(fades out)

Jill: Brad? Brad?

*(Scene ends.)*

up, allowing the water to drain out over the opposite side.)*

Scene 3. Muffled Conversation (Note: You must have heard cinema 7a to see 
this scene.)

*(Dormitory hallway near the #002 Door. Jill stands near, listening.)*
[Voices are heard from the other side of the door.]

Barry: It can't be true! I've been told a different story.

(pause)

Barry: But it's not necessary for you to destroy STARS!

(pause)

Barry: What about my family?!?

(pause)

Barry: So everything depends on me... Huh?

*(End Scene. You can either choose to enter or not enter. It will affect
which cinemas you see later on.)*

[Extra : Here is the true conversation... Wesker is in this conversation, but
is muffled out. Unmuffled, it says...]

Barry: It can't be true! I've been told a different story.

Wesker: Hey, there is nothing we can do. The situation has changed.

Barry: But it's not necessary for you to destroy STARS!

Wesker: It's not my intention! It's Umbrella's. I can't help it.

Barry: What about my family?!?

Wesker: I will guarantee their safety.

Barry: So everything depends on me... Huh?

Scene 4(P): Encounter With Barry (Note: You see this scene if you enter the
room after hearing the muffled conversation.)

*(Dormitory; Room 002. As she enters, Jill looks around and then walks down
the hallway, running into Barry.)*

Barry: Hi, Jill.

Jill: Uh, hi, Barry. I, I heard someone talking.

Barry: So you heard it too... I think I'm getting old. It seems that talking
to myself is becoming a habit.

Jill: Talking to yourself? Barry, something must have happened to you. Am I
wrong? You sound strange.

Barry: Well, it seems I made you worry. But don't. Maybe I have been a 
nervous wreck since all of these strange things started happening. Well,
I think I'll go out and get some fresh air for a change.

*(Barry walks by Jill.)*

Barry: I told ya, don't worry... I'll just go and get some fresh air... and
be eaten by a monster!

*(Barry exits. Jill holds out her hand as if to stop him. Scene ends.)*

Scene 5(P): Neptune CGI (Note: You must always run to the right in the Broken
Aquarium room to see this CGI.)

*(As Jill nears the door to the Control Room, the camera view switches to
something underwater. It seems to be swimming at a rather fast speed. We then
see Jill from the creature's viewpoint, oblivious to the thing that is 
coming up behind her...)*

Scene 6a. V-Jolt on Root

*(Jill walks up to Plant 42's root. It says "It looks like a giant plant 
root." Jill takes out the V-Jolt and uses it on the root. A yellow steam 
begins to come from the point of contact, and as Jill waves goodbye, the
root begins to shrink in size and turns brown. It stops contracting and
stiffens up when it is about half of its original size. When Jill walks up
to it now, it says "It's withered.")*

Scene 6b. Barry to the Rescue (Note: To see this scene, you must have seen
either cinema 7ba or 7bb, or not step in after hearing Barry's muffled
conversation. You must also not use the V-Jolt.)

*(Plant 42 Room. As Jill shoots Plant 42, its tentacles fall off. Once a few
have fallen off, it contracts into a smaller ball. As it opens back up into
its original size, one of the tentacles grabs out and snatches Jill up. Barry
then walks in.)*

Barry: What the hell is this?

Jill: Barry! 

Barry: Jill!

*(Barry then walks up to Plant 42 and begins to fire his flamethrower at it.
It begins to burn. It throws Jill to the ground, and dies burning, its purple
remains falling into a puddle on the floor.)*

Jill: You saved me!

Barry: Yeah...

Jill: That was close! Thanks, Barry.

Barry: Don't mention it. What a monster! I can't believe--What the hell is
this place, anyway?

[Extra Click: Talk to Barry again, and he'll say...]

Barry: Okay, I'm gonna stay in the Soldier's Area and take a look around.
Though I'm sure there are still things in that other mansion as well. Anyway,
let's start searching seperately.

Jill: Okay.

Scene 7. Reunite With Wesker

*(Dormitory Hallway. Gunshots can be heard. Jill follows the sound to find
Wesker shooting bees.)*

Jill: Wesker!

Wesker: Jill... so you're safe.

Jill: That's what I was going to say. Where on earth have you been? You
disappeared from the hall all of a sudden.

Wesker: I'm sorry, but I have my reasons. Perhaps you guys have met them?
It was all I could do to protect myself against those... strange creatures.

Jill: Is that right? Anyway, it's good to see you're safe.

Wesker: Jill, our first priority is to get out of here.

Jill: Yes, you're right.

Wesker: Now there are a lot of rooms in that mansion that we can't get into
because they're locked up. I have been looking around for clues...

Jill: Okay, I'll go to the other house and see if I can find any clues.

Wesker: Will you do that? I'm counting on you.

*(Wesker walks away. Scene ends.)*

8(P). Radio Transmission #2 (Note: Must have Radio to see this cinema.)

*(Outside the Dormitory entrance, in the Garden. The radio beeps. Jill turns
it on.)*

Brad: This is Brad. I know you can't answer me, but somehow, give me a sign.

Jill: (into radio) This is Jill. Brad? (angry moan) It's broken...

C. Return to the Mansion
------------------------

Scene 1. Hunter CGI

*(After returning inside the mansion, primarily the room that leads to the
terrace path right before exiting the mansion, the view switches. Something
seems to be pursuing Jill! It quickly climbs the ladder near the elevator in
the Courtyard, runs toward the shed (which has no door), runs into it, opens 
the door, runs through the terrace, and grasps the handle into the next 
room... *CGI ENDS* Jill turns around to see a Hunter calmly walking through
the door...)*

Scene 2. Snake Confrontation

*(Jill is in a big, sparsely furnished room with a tile floor. The only 
objects in the room are a fireplace, a piano, and a small table-and-chair
set. Jill walks over to the piano. As she begins to check it, the huge snake
previously encountered in the attic slides out of the fireplace! It seems to
be scarred from its last encounter with Jill, seeing that in some places its
muscle is showing. It hisses, recognizing her. It strikes at Jill, but she
dodges just in time, with the snake's strike caving in a section of the
floor. The battle begins...)*

Scene 3a. Meet with Barry A

*(After killing the snake, it dissolves into a pile of purple goo. Jill then
investigates the hole the snake made. It says "It's too dark to see 
anything." Barry then enters the room. Jill gets up from her investigating
crouch. Barry walks over to the hole and crouches down.)*

Barry: Jill, have you found anything interesting?

Jill: Yes, but I can't see very well.

Barry: How about going down to check by yourself? I have a rope here.

Jill: Oh, do you? Well then I'll try to go down using the rope.

Barry: Wait. 

*(Barry tosses the rope down into the hole. Jill climbs down. But once she is
down, the rope falls!)*

Jill: Hey, what's going on?

*(Camera switch to Barry up above)*

Barry: Now I've done it! Sorry, Jill, wait. I'll go and get another rope.

*(He exits. Camera switch back to Jill)*

Jill: Barry? Barry!

(Note: You can now either head down into the basement or wait for Barry. If
you don't wait, Barry will die in the Lab area.)

*(Jill waits. Camera switch to Barry, who returns to the room. Camera
switches back to Jill.)*

Barry: Hey, are you there, Jill? Grab the rope!

*(Camera switches back to Barry, who throws it down the hole. Jill climbs
it. Both are now in the Piano Room.)*

Barry: I'm sorry, Jill.

Jill: I didn't know THAT was going to happen.

Barry: Sorry. I was really careless.

Jill: Are you okay, Barry? Maybe you're getting tired.

Barry: No, I'm alright. Don't worry. (pause) Jill, I've found something!

*(Jill walks over and takes it from him. It reads...)*

<BEGIN>

Jill: Thank you. I'll take this then.

*(Barry leaves the room.)*

Scene 3b. Meet with Barry B

*(After killing the snake, it dissolves into a pile of purple goo. Jill then
investigates the hole the snake made. It says "It's too dark to see 
anything." Barry then enters the room. Jill gets up from her investigating
crouch. Barry walks over to the hole and crouches down.)*

Barry: Jill, have you found anything interesting?

Jill: Yes, but I can't see very well.

Barry: How about going down to check by yourself? I have a rope here.

Jill: Oh, do you? Well then I'll try to go down using the rope.

Barry: Wait. 

*(Barry tosses the rope down into the hole.)*

Barry: Yeah, Richard gave this to me. The radio is a keepsake from him.

Jill: Richard... *(She takes the Radio.)*

Barry: This is more useful to you than me. Ready to go? *(Jill nods. Then
Jill climbs down. But once she is down, the rope falls!)*

Jill: Hey, what's going on?

*(Camera switch to Barry up above)*

Barry: Now I've done it! Sorry, Jill, wait. I'll go and get another rope.

*(He exits. Camera switch back to Jill)*

Jill: Barry? Barry!

(Note: You can now either head down into the basement or wait for Barry. If
you don't wait, Barry will die in the Lab area.)

*(Barry leaves the room.)*

Scene 4. Zombie CGI #2

*(Jill is in the Basement Kitchen. She approaches the door in the far corner.
*CGI START* Zombie viewpoint. He walks down the stairs slowly, making
squelching noises with each step. As he reaches the bottom, he struggles with
the doorknob, finally managing to get it open. His rotten hand is seen...
*CGI END* Jill backs off as the zombie walks through the door...)*

D. The Underground Tunnels
--------------------------

Scene 1. Trust Barry?

*(The second Underground Passageway. As Jill enters, Barry is there. He turns
around to face her.)*

Barry: Oh, Jill. What good timing. A moment ago I heard someone's voice
coming from this hall. Let's go together, since it's dark, and we can't see
very well.

(Note: Now you must make two choices that will affect the outcome of
your game.)

Scene 1a. Yes-Yes

[Will you go with him? YES]

Jill: Okay, let's go.

Barry: Okay. Then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(Jill looks down.)*
Hey, are you alright? I can go first if you want me to.

[Do you want him to go first? YES]

Jill: Oh, yes, please. I'm a little nervous.

Barry: I understand. It may be more dangerous if you come behind me. Be
careful! *(Barry walks off. As Jill walks forward to follow him, a gunshot
is heard.)*

Jill: Barry?

(Note: Here, you can either go follow him, or run out back through the door
you entered. If you do not follow him, Barry will die in these tunnels.)

*(Jill follows him into the next room. As she enters next to Barry, a Hunter
attacks. It leaps into the air, but Barry shoots it down. He then pounds a
round into it while it lays on the floor. It dies.)*

Barry: That was too close. Let's go together.

Jill: (nods) Okay, let's go!

Barry: Okay, then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(They continue. Scene
ends.)*

Scene 1b. Yes-No

[Will you go with him? YES]

Jill: Okay, let's go.

Barry: Okay. Then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(Jill looks down.)*
Hey, are you alright? I can go first if you want me to.

[Do you want him to go first? NO]

Jill: Okay, let's go, Barry. I'm depending on you.

*(They walk through the next room with little trouble. As they near the door
to the Enrico Passage, a Hunter jumps down from across the hallway. As it
runs toward the two, Barry shoots it twice and it dies. They proceed into the
next room.)*

Scene 1c. No-Yes

[Will you go with him? NO]

Jill: Barry, I...

Barry: Sure, it may be dangerous. I'll go, even if I have to go by myself.
Will you be waiting here, Jill?

[Will you stay here? YES]

Jill: I'm sorry.

Barry: It's okay. I'm going now. *(Barry salutes her and walks off. Jill won't
see him again until the Wesker confrontation in the lab. Barry dies
afterwards.)*

Scene 1d. No-No

[Will you go with him? NO]

Jill: Barry, I...

Barry: Sure, it may be dangerous. I'll go, even if I have to go by myself.
Will you be waiting here, Jill?

[Will you stay here? NO]

Jill: Barry, I think I'll take some other route. 

Barry: I see. Yeah, maybe you should. Be careful! *(Barry salutes her and 
walks off. As Jill walks forward, a gunshot is heard.)*

Jill: Barry?

(Note: Here, you can either save him, and the events described above in 1b
will happen, or you can run away and let him die in the tunnels.)

Scene 2a. Meet Enrico A

*(Jill walks past the turning point of the room. Barry is also in the room.)*

Enrico: Is that Jill?

Jill: Is that voice Enrico's?

Enrico: Yeah.

Jill: You're alive!

Enrico: (interrupting) Wait there! Are you with anybody, Jill?

*(The camera angle changes, giving us our first glimpse of Enrico. He is
sitting down.)*

Jill: What? Oh yes. *(Barry walks over.)*

Barry: Enrico! *(He walks closer to join Jill.)*

Enrico: So, Barry and Jill together. 

Barry: Are you alright, Enrico?

Enrico: The S.T.A.R.S. are doomed. Someone is a traitor. (The camera zooms
in on Enrico) Everything was plotted from the start by Umbrella...

*(A gunshot is heard, and blood flies from Enrico's head. He cries out in
pain, and slumps over to the ground. Barry runs over to him.)*

Jill: Enrico!!

*(Jill turns her head. Footsteps are heard running away...)*

[Extra click: If you click on Barry, it says [Barry is investigating...]]

Scene 2b. Meet Enrico B

*(Jill walks past the turning point of the room.)*

Enrico: Is that Jill?

Jill: Is that voice Enrico's?

Enrico: Yeah.

Jill: You're alive!

Enrico: (interrupting) Wait there! Are you with anybody, Jill?

*(The camera angle changes, giving us our first glimpse of Enrico. He is
sitting down.)*

Jill: Wha, What? Oh, no; I'm alone. But why are you asking?

Enrico: Listen, the S.T.A.R.S. are going to be finished soon. Someone is a 
traitor. (Camera closeup on Enrico) Everything was plotted from the start by
Umbrella... 

*(A gunshot is heard, and blood flies from Enrico's head. He cries out in
pain, and slumps over to the ground. Footsteps are heard from someone 
running away. Jill turns her head.)*

Jill: Enrico! Who killed him, I wonder?

[Extra Click: If you click on Enrico, it'll say [He couldn't have moved 
because of this injury... He's holding something.]]

Scene 3(P). Barry Dies #1

*(Jill returns to the first underground tunnel. Barry is lying on the floor.
Jill kneels down next to him.)*

Jill: What happened?

Barry: Uhh... I'm really... embarrassed... I was... clumsy... 

Jill: Oh, you don't have to talk. I'm going to give you first aid!

Barry: Maybe... my time's come... Jill... take this... I've been cheating...
you all... from the start... If you can... forgive me... Would you... please
give this to my family... (Jill nods) And if you can... please... try... to
protect them...

Jill: What do you mean by that, Barry? Don't give up!

Barry: Uhh... Jill... be careful of that guy... (gasps) Please... stay
alive... (convulses, gives his last sigh, and dies)

*(Jill puts her hand to her mouth and reads what Barry gave her. It says...)*

E. The Umbrella Lab
-------------------

Scene 1. Draining the Fountain CGI

*(After Jill inserts the Wolf and Eagle Medals into the fountain, a CGI 
begins. *CGI START* The camera pans around the fountain, whose
water drains through what seems like an opening in the bottom of the

back hair, and he is wearing sunglasses...
*(The slides end.)*

Scene 3(P). Meet with Chris (Note: You must have the 3
passcodes, and talk to Chris prior to setting off the self-
destruct or using the Master Key to see this scene.)
*(Jill walks over to the prison door and tries to open it.)*

Chris: Jill? Is that you, Jill?

Jill: Oh Chris! You're alive!

Chris: (walks over to the cell door window) Of course.
Dammit, we're in quite a predicament, Jill.

Jill: I know, Chris. Anyway, I have to open this room.
*(She bangs on the handle twice, and moans.)* 
It doesn't work! Well, Chris, I'll be sure to come back
and help you soon. Will you wait here?

Chris: Thanks! I'll be waiting here for you.

*(Scene ends.)*

Scene 4a. Rejoin with Barry 1

*(As Jill activates the switch to the B4 Elevator, someone
talks.)*

Barry: Jill!

*(He walks over to her.)*

Barry: Jill, you're here too?

Jill: Yes, you're here too?

Barry: Look, uh, I lost my way.

Jill: Let's get going!

*(They get into the elevator.)*

Scene 4b. Rejoin with Barry 2 (Note: You must have not waited for 
Barry to bring back the rope in order to see this cinema.)

*(As Jill activates the switch to the B4 Elevator, someone talks.)*

Barry: Jill!

*(He walks over to her.)*

Barry: I was looking for you.

Jill: Barry...

Barry: Jill... Don't be angry. I wanted you to wait for me.

Jill: Barry, don't screw up again like you did when you dropped that
rope.

*(They enter the elevator. Scene ends.)*

Scene 5a. Wesker Conversation 1 (Note: You must have 
either not waited for Barry after he dropped the rope or 
answered No-Yes to his questions in the Underground 
to see this cinema.)

*(The two get off the elevator. Barry slows down and 
lets Jill get ahead of them. After they turn the corner, they
find Wesker waiting. Barry points his gun at Jill's head.)*

Jill: Wesker?

Wesker: You did a fine job, Barry.

Jill: Just as I thought...

Wesker: I think you should stay away from Barry, Jill. 
I hear that his wife and two daughters will be in danger if he
doesn't do everything I tell him to.

Jill: You are so cruel...

Wesker: Well, you don't have to worry about anything,
because you'll be free from this world very soon, Jill.

Jill: Why do you have to destroy S.T.A.R.S?

Wesker: That's Umbrella's intention. This laboratory has
been engaging in dangerous experiments, and recently
an accident has occurred. Anyway, this disaster cannot
be made public.

Jill: That's why having S.T.A.R.S. nosing about is so
inconvenient. So you're a slave of Umbrella now, along
with these virus monsters.

Wesker: I think you misunderstand me, Jill. To me, the
monsters you mention mean nothing. I'm going to burn
all of them together, with this entire laboratory. I must
complete my mission, as ordered by Umbrella. Barry,
go up on the ground and wait there.

*(Barry begins to walk away.)*

Jill: Barry!

*(He hangs his head in shame and walks offscreen.)*

Wesker: Barry's such a fool. He'll be under the control
of Umbrella forever.

Jill: How come both Umbrella and you can intimidate 
him, by taking his family as hostages?

Wesker: Umbrella? Well, I intimidated him, but it had 
nothing to do with Umbrella. I just used him for my
personal purposes, though both you and Barry seemed
to think I was following orders from Umbrella.

Jill: So you're planning something else?

Wesker: If you succeeded in developing the world's most
powerful biological weapon, what would you do? What if
you were in charge?

Jill: You must stop this now.

Wesker: You're a brave girl. But if I were you, I wouldn't
give up such a big discovery. You guys are idiots. No one
understands its real value. 

Jill: So, you're going to steal all the research?

Wesker: Better yet. I'm going to show you the Tyrant.

*(Wesker leads her into the next room. Wesker is pointing
his gun at the back of Jill's head. Camera angle switches to
that of what's inside the stasis tube. Jill takes a step back
at what she sees... Scene ends.)*

Scene 5b. Wesker Conversation 2 (Note: You must have 
waited for Barry in the Mansion after the snake encounter
and either answer Yes-No in the Underground, or answer
Yes-Yes or No-No, and then go after Barry when you hear
the gunshots.)

*(The two get off the elevator. Barry slows down and 
lets Jill get ahead of them. After they turn the corner, they
find Wesker waiting. Barry points his gun at Jill's head.)*

Jill: Wesker?

Wesker: You did a fine job, Barry.

Jill: Just as I thought...

Wesker: I think you should stay away from Barry, Jill. 
I hear that his wife and two daughters will be in danger if he
doesn't do everything I tell him to.

Jill: You are so cruel...

Wesker: Well, you don't have to worry about anything,
because you'll be free from this world very soon, Jill.

Jill: Why do you have to destroy S.T.A.R.S?

Wesker: That's Umbrella's intention. This laboratory has
been engaging in dangerous experiments, and recently
an accident has occurred. Anyway, this disaster cannot
be made public.

Jill: That's why having S.T.A.R.S. nosing about is so
inconvenient. So you're a slave of Umbrella now, along
with these virus monsters.

Wesker: I think you misunderstand me, Jill. To me, the
monsters you mention mean nothing. I'm going to burn
all of them together, with this entire laboratory. I must
complete my mission, as ordered by Umbrella. Barry,
go up on the ground and wait there.

Jill: So, you're going to steal all the research?

Wesker: Better yet. I'm going to show you the Tyrant.

*(He walks over behind Jill, pointing his gun at her as
she walks forward. Suddenly, Barry steps out from 
behind the corner and pistol-whips Wesker on the 
back of the head. He groans and collapses onto the
floor, unconscious.)*

Jill: Barry!

Barry: Sorry, Jill. 

Jill: How is your family?

Barry: Uh, I was listening to what you and Wesker were
talking about. I wish I'd realized it earlier. I thought it
must have something to do with Umbrella, ya know...
(pause) So it's all been masterminded by him!

Jill: But it's good that you know that now. Anyway, let's
get out of this house first.

Barry: Jill!

Jill: Yes, what?

Barry: Do you have any idea what Wesker was going to
show you, at the back of this place?

Jill: Well, he was talking about the world's most powerful
biological weapon, called Tyrant, or something, I-I think.

Barry: Do you think we could see Tyrant now?

Jill: Barry, you're so optimistic.

Barry: (raising his weapon) It would look bad for S.T.A.R.S.
if we let such a dangerous creature run loose...

Jill: Maybe you're right. Let's go then.

*(They walk into the next room. As Jill sees the Tyrant in
the stasis tube, she freezes. Barry looks around, sees it, and
clutches his weapon. End scene.)*

Scene 5c. Wesker Conversation 3 (Note: Barry must already
be dead in order to see this cinema.)

*(Jill walks down the hallway. She turns past the center and
sees none other than Wesker standing there. )*

Jill: Wesker?

Wesker: Barry is no longer useful.

Jill: Just as I thought. You are the man behind all of this.

Wesker: Hah hah heh heh.

Jill: Why do you have to destroy S.T.A.R.S?

Wesker: That's Umbrella's intention. This laboratory has
been engaging in dangerous experiments, and recently
an accident has occurred. Anyway, this disaster cannot
be made public.

Jill: That's why having S.T.A.R.S. nosing about is so

*(Wesker leads her into the next room. Wesker is pointing
his gun at the back of Jill's head. Camera angle switches to
that of what's inside the stasis tube. Jill takes a step backwards at
what she sees... Scene ends.)*

Scene 6. Tyrant CGI

*(Jill is seen standing in front of a large stasis tube with a
huge creature inside. The camera pans across its grey face
covered with reddish veins. Its eyes are still shut... The 
camera then switches to a view of its beating heart, which is 
abnormally large, and outside of its chest cavity. It then
pans to a view of its right hand, whose fingers twitch...)*

Scene 7a. Wesker's Death

*(Wesker talks as he makes his way over to a control
panel.)*

Wesker: Tyrant virus is a super virus; which creates a
monster which is much stronger than human beings.
Tyrant is the most powerful biological weapon in the
world.

Jill: You don't mean you're experimenting on... real people?

Wesker: This is really beautiful. All this power will be 
mine...

Jill: For the sake of an awful creature?

Wesker: Don't be upset. All weak people exist to be
eaten.

*(He then goes over to the control console and taps
a few buttons. The stasis tube drains, and Tyrant
begins to bash the glass, which cracks. After two
hits, the glass shatters. The Tyrant roars and leaps
out into a waiting stance and looks at Jill. Then,
however, it looks at Wesker. While it's advancing on
him, he says...)*

Wesker: What? Don't come this way! (He reaches for
the control panel, but is skewered by the Tyrant's huge
claw.) No!!!! 

*(The Tyrant drops his corpse to the floor. The Master
Key flies out of his pocket onto the floor. Tyrant then
turns to face Jill...)*

Jill: It can't control what it does.

*(She then proceeds to fight the Tyrant...)*

Scene 7b. No! Not Barry!

Jill: Can a creature like this really be the ultimate 
biological weapon?

Barry: Really. Wesker is a crazy man! 

Jill: Tyrant is not completely developed.

Barry: But we can't let it live! (looks at the panel)
That must be the computer for monitoring this
creature!

*(Barry walks over to the control panel and begins
tapping at the buttons. The stasis tube drains, and the
Tyrant hits the glass with its palm, which cracks. It then
jumps out of the tube, and roars. It stands up and looks
at Barry.)*

Barry: Damn you!

*(He raises his Colt Python at the creature, but he is too
slow. It rakes him with his huge claw hand, sending him
collapsing onto the floor.)*

Jill: (as the Tyrant looks at her) It can't control what it
does.

*(Jill confronts the Tyrant in battle and in staying away 
from the creature and firing, she gains an easy win, as 
the creature slowly slumps to the floor. She then returns
to check on Barry.)*

Jill: Barry? Barry!

*(He slowly gets up, moaning.)*

Jill: You're alive!

Barry: I'm really... embarrassed... I was... clumsy.

Jill: Let's get going.

*(Barry nods. Scene ends.)*

Scene 8(P). Warning Announcement (Note: You must
have seen cinema 7b in order to see this cinema.)

*(Barry and Jill exit the Tyrant room. As they do, they
notice Wesker is gone.)*

Jill: What happened to Wesker?

*(An alarm goes off)*

Voice: The Triggering System has now been activated.
All researchers stand by to take cover immediately...
Unlock all routes for evacuation...

Barry: Wesker must've set it off... There isn't much time
left for us...

*(They run for the elevator. After they go up, Barry 
holds up his weapon, cocks it, and runs off. End 
Cinema.)*

spoken with Chris to see this cinema.)

*(They exit the room.)*

*(Jill enters the 2f Storage Chest Room. Barry is 
laying to the right of the chest. She runs over to
him.)*

Barry: Hi... Jill... It's you...

Jill: Barry?

Barry: I'm... really embarrassed... to see you now.
Just... just leave me. Go... go quickly.

Jill: It's over, Barry. Wesker's dead.

Barry: Is that so? (pause) Jill, will you do me a 
favor? This is my last... wish. Please... give...
this photo to my... family... Will you?

Jill: Sure.

Barry: Forgive me... Jill...

*(He sighs his last breath and slumps over on
the floor. Jill reaches out to him, hides her head
in sorrow, then looks at the picture Barry gave 
to him. It says...)*

*(A new FMV begins. The helicopter flies off into a cloudy sky. 
 A view is seen of the Mansion complex below, which stays as it
was when the S.T.A.R.S. discovered it. Jill is sitting alone in the back of
the helicopter. She caresses her forehead, takes off her barret, shakes 
her hair into place, runs her hand over her hair, and looks at the floor. The

the helicopter flying away...)*

Scene 1. Opening FMV

[1998 July]
[Raccoon Forest]
*(Background is a cloudy sky...)*
Chris: Alpha Team is flying around the forest zone, situated in northwest
Raccoon City, where we're searching for the helicopter of our compatriots
Bravo Team, who disappeared during the middle of our mission.
[Background Talk:
Wesker: Chris, you haven't found it?
Chris: No, I haven't found it yet.]

*(Changes to picture of Newspaper--"Raccoon Times--Bizarre murders committed
in Raccoon City." Then to "HORROR IN RACCOON! MORE VICTIMS DEAD." Then to 
"STARS (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) sent to save Raccoon City.", with
 a map of the mountains around Raccoon City.)*

Chris: Bizarre murder cases have recently occured in Raccoon City. There are
outlandish reports of families being attacked by a group of about 10 people.
Victims were apparently eaten. Bravo Team went to the hideout of the group,
and disappeared. 

*(Changes to the cloudy sky once again--but a plume of smoke rises above a 
field with tall grass...)*

Jill: Look, Chris!

*(Changes to Alpha Team walking through the tall grass. They all stop.)*

Chris: It was Bravo Team's helicopter. Nobody was in it. But strangely, most
of the equipment was still there. However, we soon discovered why.

*(View of an evil-looking dog-face, complete with growl noises... View 
switches to Jill and Chris, scouting together... View switches to Joseph,
scouting alone. He raises his hand and tries to grab his team's attention.)*

Joseph: Hey! Come here!

*(Dogs open their drool-covered mouths and growl a bit. View changes back to
Joseph, who carefully reaches down and discovers a severed hand, still
desperately clutching a pistol. He screams and drops it. The dogs bolt over
to him, and the camera zooms in on his terrified eyes as he is ripped apart.
Chris, then the duo of Barry and Wesker, turn to look.
It then switches for a while between the dogs' open mouths and Joseph's own
open mouth, screaming desperately. Jill's face is then seen.)*

Jill: Joseph!

*(A dog charges at Chris, who fires off a few shots from his pistol at it. 
Jill then runs, firing off two shots at the creatures. Three pistol shots
then hit the ground, evidently missing their target. Wesker then shoots 
twice at the creatures while running.)*

Wesker: Hwuh! Waah!

*(Barry then gets one shot off with his Colt Python. What is left of Alpha
team then stops, noticing their helicopter is taking off.)*

Chris: No! Don't go!

*(The helicopter flies off into the horizon, leaving the team standing there.
The dogs then continue their pursuit, leaving Alpha running again. Chris
shoots one of the dogs twice, causing it to groan in pain. Wesker shoots, and
then Chris says...)*

Chris: Jill! Run for that house!

*(After two more pistol shots from Chris, we see a view of an old-looking
mansion... And another of the dog's mouth.)*

*(We get to see the mansion's doors open and reveal an ornate-looking
main hall. Chris speaks.)*

Chris: There are only 3 STARS members left now: Captain Wesker, Jill, and 
myself. We don't know where Barry is.

[Cast]
[Chris Redfield]
*(Shots of Chris: Turning around in surprise, being skeptical, and shooting
his pistol)*

[Jill Valentine]
*(Jill pops a clip into her Beretta, readies it, and looks at the camera.)*

[Barry Burton]
*(Barry spins around the chamber on his Colt Python, readies it, holds it up,
and looks at the camera.)*

[Rebecca Chambers]
*(Rebecca tightens her bandanna and gives the camera a smile.)*

[Albert Wesker]
*(Wesker slicks his hair back, crosses his arms, and looks cooly at the 
camera.)*

[RESIDENT EVIL]

[They have escaped into the mansion, where they thought it was safe. 
Yet---]

Scene 2. Inside the Mansion

*(1f Main Hall. Wesker, Chris, and Jill are inside.)*

Jill: I don't know what happened.

Chris: Barry! Where's Barry?

Wesker: Well, I'm sorry, but he's probably...

Jill: No...

*( A gunshot is heard from the west. Chris runs toward it.)*

Jill: What is that?

Chris: I'll go and check.

Wesker: Okay, Jill and I will stay in the hall in case of an emergency.

*(Chris begins to walk away.)*

Jill: Chris... take care.

*(Chris waves to her and exits.)*

[Extra Click: Chris goes back into the Main Hall.]

Wesker: Investigate if you hear any gunfire.

*(Chris shrugs and leaves the hall.)*

Scene 3. Zombie CGI

*(We see a man wearing a green jacket who has a bald, white, diseased-looking
head. He is crouched over another man, apparently eating the poor soul. He
takes a soft bite, then a loud one, which causes a puddle of blood to ooze 
out over the carpet. The zombie then slowly turns his head to look at you
with his cataracted blue eye and bloody lips...)*

Scene 4. Searching for Wesker

*(Chris reenters the Main Hall, which is empty. He looks around, and runs
toward the center of the Hall.)*

Chris: Wesker? Jill?

*(Chris runs around and looks around some more.)*

Chris: What happened to Jill and Wesker?

*(Scene ends.)*

Optional Scene: Cerberus CGI (Note: You must check the Main Hall 1f doors
that lead to the outside.)

*(As Chris opens the main hall door, a dog with half of the skin on its head
torn off sticks its head inside the room and growls. He shuts it quickly.)*

Scene 5a. Meet Rebecca #1 (Note: You must go to the 1f West Save Room to
see this cinema, and not have met Rebecca earlier.)

*(1f West Save Room. As Chris enters, a white spray hits him.)*

Chris: Whoah! What is it?

*(Rebecca gets out of her defensive crouch.)*

Rebecca: What? Oh! Oh no! Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

Chris: Heh ha, you must be from the Bravo Team. 

Rebecca: Yes, I'm Rebecca. Rebecca Chambers. I'm a newcomer. I just joined
the STARS Bravo Team last month. Well, I'm really sorry. Are you all right?

Chris: Yes. I'm Chris Redfield, from the Alpha Team. Are you the only person
here from the Bravo Team?

Rebecca: Well, because the helicopter made a forced landing, I just ran into
this house, anyway, but I, uh... uh...

Chris: I see. There's nothing else you could've done, anyway, it's good you're
here.

Rebecca: (salutes) Yes, sir. But it's strange... I serviced the helicopter
recently, but something went wrong with the engine. It was such a short
flight...

[Extra Click: Talk to Rebecca again and she'll say...]

Rebecca: I wonder if everybody is...

Scene 5a-a. Yes

*(As Chris turns to leave, Rebecca speaks.)*

Rebecca: Well? What should I do now? If you go out to search for the other
members, how about letting me come with you?

[Will you take Rebecca with you?]
[Yes]

Chris: Alright, let's do it!

Rebecca: (salutes) Yes sir! I'll do my best. (pause) I have to prepare
something; would you like to go ahead?

*(Chris leaves; end scene.)*

Scene 5a-b. No

*(As Chris turns to leave, Rebecca speaks.)*

Rebecca: Well? What should I do now? If you go out to search for the other
members, how about letting me come with you?

[Will you take Rebecca with you?]
[No]

Chris: It's pretty dangerous outside; let me take care of it.

Rebecca: I understand. For now, I'll wait here, since there are a lot of
chemicals in this room, and they might be useful. Well, I'll look over the 
chemicals.

*(Chris leaves; end scene.)*

[Extra Click: If you exit and reenter right away, Rebecca will say...]

Rebecca: Well, I'll look over the chemicals.

[Semi-Extra Click: If you return a little while later, Rebecca will say...]

*(Rebecca is sitting on the bed, holding her head. As Chris approaches,
she gets up.)*

Rebecca: Ah, Chris! This room is fully equipped with medical supplies. I
can treat you, except for your major injury. Would you like me to?

[Do you want me to heal your wounds?]

[Yes]
Chris: Please do something for me, temporarily.

*(Screen fades to black.)*

[Rebecca treats Chris.]

*(Screen fades back in.)*

Rebecca: Most of these medicines are from Umbrella.

Chris: What's Umbrella?

Rebecca: Don't you know? It's a large-scale pharmaceutical company
based in Raccoon City.

Chris: Oh, I see. And do you know how much of the medicine is useable?

Rebecca: Well, probably there is enough for 2 doses.

[Extra Click: Talk to Rebecca again. She'll say... (and this holds true for
all other extra clicks afterwards in this room)]

Rebecca: Chris, take care!

[No]
Chris: I'm okay, but if something happens to me, (desperately) please take
care of me. 

Rebecca: Okay. You can depend on me. But we only have enough medicine
for 3 more doses. Excuse me, but you aren't mad at me about all that, are you?

Chris: Oh, of course not. You were pretty worried, though, weren't you? Hey, 
we're partners, aren't we? Let's work together.

Rebecca: Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

*(Scene ends.)*

[Semi-Extra Click 2: If you go to the Main Hall, then back to the Save Room,
Rebecca will say...]

*(Rebecca is sitting on the bed, holding her head. As Chris approaches,
she gets up.)*

Rebecca: Are you alright? Want me to treat it?

[Do you want me to heal your wounds?]

[Yes]
*(Screen fades to black.)*

[Rebecca treats Chris.]

*(Screen fades back in. Chris walks away.)*

[No]
*(Chris walks away.)*

[Semi-Extra Click 3: If you go to the Main Hall, then back to the Save Room,
Rebecca will say...]

[Do you want me to heal your wounds?]

[Yes]

[No]
*(Chris walks away.)*

*(End Extra Click.)*

Scene 5b. Meet Rebecca #2 (Note: You must not see Rebecca in the 1f
West Save Room, and also go to the Marble Hallway on the 2f.)

*(As Chris turns the corner, he sees Richard Aiken from the Bravo Team
laying on the floor, wounded. A woman is crouching over him.)*

Rebecca: Who are you?

Chris: I'm Chris, of Alpha Team. I've come to rescue you. Richard, what 
happened?

*(Chris runs over to his side.)*

Richard: Chris... this house is too dangerous... there are terrible demons...
(blood gushes up from a wound) Ouch!

Rebecca: Richard, don't talk. He seems to have been bitten by a poisonous
snake, but the size of the wound is abnormally large.

Richard: It's not just a poisonous snake, it's a monster!

Rebecca: Richard... He needs serum, but we left it in another room. 

Chris: Okay, I'll go! (runs)

Rebecca: Hurry, please!

Chris: I will. Wait here, I'll be back soon.

Rebecca: Yes he is; thanks. Richard, hold on, I'll give you a shot now.

Richard: Chris... Chris... here's a Radio... take it... 

*(Richard's wounds begin to spurt blood.)*

Chris: Richard! No!

Rebecca: Richard!

Richard: Rebecca... be careful... 

*(Richard raises his hand, and suddenly goes limp. He is dead. Rebecca
tugs at his corpse after both Chris and Rebecca shake their heads.)*

Rebecca: Richard... Richard! Are you...

Chris: Rebecca, it's very dangerous out here. Will you come with me?

Rebecca: I... I'd like to stay here a little bit longer... 

Chris: Okay, Rebecca. Can you use a gun? I'll look for the others. Protect
yourself.

*(Chris turns and runs.)*

Rebecca: Chris, be careful, please!

*(He turns and waves at her. Scene ends.)*

Chris: Is that you, Rebecca? 

*(She looks at the piano, then walks over to it.)*

Rebecca: Ah, it's the Moonlight Sonata. 

Chris: Can you play?

*(Rebecca proceeds to play the song, but not without errors. She eventually
gives up, clunking on the keyboard.)*

Chris: Wait, what is that?

Rebecca: My interpretation is off a little. Chris, may I practice for a while?

*(Decision point. End scene.)*

Scene 6b. Maestro Rebecca #2 (Note: You must have seen Rebecca in the 2f
Marble Room in order to see this cinema.)

*(Chris uses the Music Notes on the Piano.)*

[Chris unfortunately can't read music.]

Rebecca: My interpretation is off a little. Chris, may I practice for a while?

*(Decision point. End scene.)*

Scene 7a. Answer Yes (Note: This path is no different than saying no. It just
enacts a different cinema.)

[Will you have Rebecca practice?]
[Yes]

Chris: See, just relax and play.

Rebecca: Alright.

*(She begins to practice. End scene.)*

Scene 7b. Answer No (Note: This path is no different than saying yes. It just
plays a halfway funny cinema.)

[Will you have Rebecca practice?]
[No]

Chris: Let's go back and look for them at once.

Rebecca: All right. 

*(As Chris turns to exit, Rebecca is still playing on the piano.)*

slide back into the hole it first came from, leaving Chris free to collect the
Moon Crest.)*

Scene 10a. Chris collapses (Note: You must have met Rebecca in the 1f Save

The huge plant grabs him with its tentacles. Chris emits a scream of pain.
Rebecca, who is out in the Hive Hallway, runs into the room.)*

Rebecca: Chris!

*(She raises her pistol at the T-virus infected plant.)*

Chris: Rebecca... No... It's no use. The roots of it are in the basement. You
could... whoah...

Rebecca: Chris!

Chris: Take this file with you.

*(Chris throws a blue book down.)*

Chris: Use the information in it... in order to make the potion... and kill
the root. Rebecca, please...

*(She kneels down and picks up the book.)*

Rebecca: Chris, don't die!

*(Rebecca makes the V-Jolt, and goes down to the Basement Meeting Room
to kill the root. She walks up to Plant 42's root. It says "It looks like
a giant plant root." Rebecca takes out the V-Jolt and uses it on the root.
A yellow steam begins to come from the point of contact, and as she waves
goodbye, the root begins to shrink in size and turns brown. It stops
contracting and stiffens up when it is about half of its original size.
When Becca walks up to it now, it says "It's withered." As she turns to leave,
the camera switches back to Chris and Plant 42. Chris is still within its
grasp. However, it raises Chris to the ceiling, and tosses him brutally to
the floor. Three tentacles fall off the plant, and it contracts to a much
smaller size. As it regains its strength, Chris begins to fight with it.
Eventually, after all of its active tentacles fall off, it falls from the
ceiling and becomes a pile of purple goo. Chris gets a key from the fireplace
and leaves the room.)*

again. 

*(Rebecca shakes her head and puts her hand to her face.)*

Rebecca: I... just...

Chris: Really, thank you.

*(Rebecca turns her head away and looks at the floor.)*

Rebecca: (hesitantly) You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?

Chris: (nods) I guarantee it.

Rebecca: Well, Chris, this is Richard's Radio. We received communication
from Brad at the courtyard a little while ago, but he is still flying around
in the sky. He obviously couldn't hear our voices. Maybe his radio is broken.

Chris: I see; understood. I'll keep it. We should somehow let Brad know
we're here.

*(Rebecca gives him the Radio.)*

Rebecca: At the pharmaceutical room I found a little while ago, I think I will
be able to make something...

*(She walks away; stopping in the middle.)*

[Rebecca treats Chris.]

Wesker: Chris... You're alive.

Chris: My words exactly. Where's Jill? Aren't you with Jill?

Wesker: I'm sorry. We were attacked by a strange monster. I lost track
of her while we were scouting around. I hope she's okay...

Chris: I see. Well, it's not your fault. This place is crazy! If we stay here,
all of us will end up dead! What should we do, Wesker?

Wesker: We have to complete this mission. Whether we escape or stay
and look for Jill, we don't have many bullets left, and we can't even 
protect ourselves. We're still in trouble. Chris, there are a lot of locked
rooms in that house. Check them out one more time. There must be a 
place to hide safely. I'll look around the house a little more.

*(Chris is in a big, sparsely furnished room with a tile floor. The only 
objects in the room are a fireplace, a piano, and a small table-and-chair
set. He walks over to the piano. As he begins to check it, the huge snake
previously encountered in the attic slides out of the fireplace! It seems to
be scarred from its last encounter with Chris, seeing that in some places its
muscle is showing. It hisses, recognizing him. It strikes at Chris, but he
dodges just in time, with the snake's strike caving in a section of the 
floor. The battle begins...)*

Wesker: Chris, as my subordinate, you have wonderful talent.

Chris: I would never work for a company like Umbrella... And Wesker,
you were formally with Umbrella.

Wesker: What do you mean?

Chris: Since when have you been an Umbrella agent, and a traitor
to the S.T.A.R.S.?

Wesker: Now you're wrong! I was formally with Umbrella, yes; but 
now I'm prepared to face anything, even getting rid of you vigilante
S.T.A.R.S.!

Chris: Now the worst possible situation has occured. The failure of 
the experiment created a virus; a biological weapon, polluting the
entire lab!

Wesker: No, the worst happened with the Tyrant Virus; I lost some of
my S.T.A.R.S. team members because of it. 

Chris: You killed them with your own hands! Did you kill Enrico?

Rebecca: Really?

Wesker: Yeah. Like this...

*(He raises his pistol and fires at Rebecca. She falls to the ground.)*

Chris: You killed them with your own hands! Did you kill Enrico?

Wesker: Enrico? I'll destroy the S.T.A.R.S. myself, including you. The
fact is, Umbrella does not know what to do with the Tyrant Virus. We
have orders to blow up this laboratory, and it's not a bad idea. But I
think we should save this important research... for future use. 

Chris: You, you think you can disappear with such important material?

Wesker: Would you like to see it? Come with me... Sorry for my lack of
manners, but I'm not used to escorting men. Now, walk.

pans to a view of its right hand, whose fingers twitch...)*

Scene 7. Wesker's Death

Chris: Is this...?

*(Wesker walks over to a control panel.)*

Wesker: That's right; this is the ultimate lifeform, Tyrant!

Chris: Ho ho ho ha ha ha...

Wesker: Chris?

Chris: Hahahahahahahahahaha....

*(Wesker points his gun at Chris.)*

Wesker: Stop it!

Chris: Wesker, you're pitiful. This is your savior? You say this failure
is your savior?

Wesker: You can make sure yourself whether Tyrant is a failure or not.

*(He then goes over to the control console and taps
a few buttons. The stasis tube drains, and Tyrant
begins to bash the glass, which cracks. After two
hits, the glass shatters. The Tyrant roars and leaps
out into a waiting stance and looks at Chris.)*

Wesker: Go to hell. Jill will join you too.

*(The Tyrant then turns and looks at Wesker. As it begins to advance
on him, he says...)*

place up!

see this cinema.)

*(Chris arrives on the heliport. He sets off a flare. After a while, Brad
flies overhead. As he is preparing to land, the camera angle switches.
Suddenly, something bursts through the pavement, sending hunks of gravel
flying. The Tyrant has followed Chris here... He utters a roar and runs
toward Redfield...)*

13b(P). Helicopter Rescue (Note: Rebecca must be dead in order to see this

actually hits the Tyrant square in the chest. It explodes into small chunks--
a claw, a hand, a head, two legs... the screen fades to black.)*

ENDINGS
-------------

Scene 16a. Ending A - Chris (Note: You must have rescued no one to
see this ending.)

*(A CGI begins. The helicopter flies out from the horizon, and lands in the
Heliport; wobbling a bit as it lands. End this CGI.)*

*(A new FMV begins. The helicopter flies off into a cloudy sky. 
 A view is seen of the Mansion complex below, which stays as it
was when the S.T.A.R.S. discovered it. The helicopter continues to fly...
The view then switches to Chris inside the copter. He sighs, wipes the
sweat off of his brow, sighs again, and leans back and stares into 
nothingness. The view then shifts to one inside Raccoon Forest. We see
the helicopter fly away...)*

Scene 16b. Ending B - Chris & Jill (Note: You must have only rescued Jill to
see this ending.)

*(A CGI begins. The helicopter flies out from the horizon, and lands in the
Heliport; wobbling a bit as it lands. End this CGI.)*

*(A new FMV begins. The helicopter flies off into a cloudy sky. 
A view is seen of the Mansion complex below, which stays as it
was when the S.T.A.R.S. discovered it. The view switches to Jill and Chris
inside the helicopter. Jill is resting with her head on Chris' shoulder. She
puts her hand on Chris' leg, who puts his hand on hers. Jill looks up at him,
but he is intensely staring out into space, wearing a stone expression on his
face. The camera angle changes to the view from inside Raccoon Forest... 
we see the helicopter flying away...)*

Scene 16c. Ending C - Chris & Rebecca (Note: You must have saved only
Rebecca to see this ending.)

*(A CGI begins. The helicopter flies out from the horizon, and lands in the
Heliport; wobbling a bit as it lands. End this CGI.)*

*(A new FMV begins. The helicopter flies off  over a cloudy sky.
 A view is seen of the Mansion complex below, which after a few seconds
bursts into a red-hot ball of flame. We then see the mushroom of the explosion
along with the helicopter flying away. It switches to a view inside the 
helicopter. Chris is looking to his right as Rebecca stretches and yawns.)*

Chris: Are you tired, Rebecca?

Rebecca: Sorry, Chris... I am.

Chris: You did a really good job. This case was just too weird...

*(Close-up on Chris's face.)*

Chris: This case was... (shakes his head slowly)

*(We then get a view of the helicopter flying off into a reddish-orange
sunset. End FMV.)*

Scene 16d. Ending D - Chris, Jill & Rebecca (Note: You must have saved both
Jill and Rebecca to see this ending.)

*(A CGI begins. The helicopter flies out from the horizon, and lands in the
Heliport; wobbling a bit as it lands. End this CGI.)*

his brow, and looks at Rebecca, which causes him to grin. She is sleeping,
and snoring a little. Chris then looks away and sighs... We then get

heroes a roar...)*

Rebecca. Otherwise, only a black screen showing your total time and 
number of saves will be displayed.)

*RESIDENT EVIL : DIRECTORS' CUT / PC VERSION SCRIPT*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Note: I will not include the entire scenes as written above, as that would
just be a waste of space. I will only include the scenes that differ quite
significantly from the standard Resident Evil. Another note--due to a 
Capcom error, Scenes 1, 2, and 4 were left out of the Directors' Cut
Version. However, they are left intact for the PC Release of the game.)

Scene 1. Uncut Intro

*(Incomplete)*

Scene 2. Uncut Zombie FMV #1

*(We see a man wearing a green jacket who has a bald, white, 
diseased-looking head. He is crouched over another man, 
apparently eating him. He takes a soft bite, and then a loud one that
causes blood to ooze out in a puddle over the carpet. A black man's
head drops down... it's Kenneth Sullivan from the Bravo Team! The
head then rolls over, and we see it has been eaten on one side down
to the skull. The zombie then slowly turns his head to look at you
with his cataracted blue eye and bloody lips...)*

Scene 3. Forest Speyer's Return (Note: In Jill's case, you must not see Barry
on the Terrace. In Chris's case, he just must come to the Terrace.)

*(Chris/Jill kneels down to investigate Forest's corpse. As he/she does, it
gets up to attack them! Forest has become a zombie! However, he is disposed of
just as easily as any other zombie. Chris/Jill continues on...)*

Scene 4. Violent Ending (Note: You must have the infinite Rocket Launcher
in your inventory.)

*(Incomplete)*

*RESIDENT EVIL : SATURN VERSION SCRIPT*
------------------------------------------------------------------
(Note: This version is basically the same as the original Resident Evil,
except for one major difference: in Chris's game, there is a second Tyrant
down in the Umbrella Lab Room where the first Tyrant is encountered,
plus the addition of a Battle Game.)

Scene 1. Second Tyrant In Lab

*(Incomplete)*

*MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON RESIDENT EVIL*
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- An annoying thing. Did you notice that the Tyrant's mouth is always
opening and closing? It gets quite annoying. It even does this after you've
killed it with the Rocket Launcher! Aargh...

- Another small thing you may have missed : If you look at the cards Chris
and Jill have in the beginning of the game on the Character Select screen,
notice Police Chief Brian Irons from Resident Evil 2 has signed both their
cards. Just shows you they paid attention to detail...

- Just a little note: Even in Jill's Good Ending (Barry or Chris & Barry
saved) Wesker does die. If you go back to the Power Room (The last room with
Chimeras/Lab Monsters), his corpse is near the triggering system. In the 
Directors' Cut Version, he is decapitated. I just thought I'd say this because
many people aren't aware of it...

- I currently have no information on the Saturn Version's Battle Game. If
there are any new cinemas, I will be sure to include them. Soon I should have
more Battle Game info.
