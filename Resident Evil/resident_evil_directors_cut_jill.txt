FEEDBACK
  Well I must have got a million emails on this FAQ which is to say quite unexpected.
Half those million questions asked where the helmet key was.?!?!?Did they not read this FAQ.
Its in this FAQ so read this time.I also got a ton of emails about me saying the game is called
advanced and there's is called Arrange.?!?My copy says advanced so I stick by that!Yes arrange 
and advance are the same game.I also received a few emails on the picture puzzle.Thanx for 
telling me guys,I fixed the prob.Oh wait there was no prob.If you don't follow this walkthru
directly expect the game to be a little different.If I feel your questions are answered in
the FAq I WILL NOT RPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE!So if your having trouble check out my web page.

THE ENEMIES
  One of the greatest strategies is to know the enemy.
**the zombie**The slowest and easiest of all enemies in the game.These enemies are easier to
dodge rather than fight.
**dogs**Fast and deadly they should be taken out quick before they take out you.
**hunters**even more deadly then the dogs.The hunters is an enemy I hate to encounter.I usually
just dodge them.But its best to kill them using the colt python or acid rounds.
**chimeras**They hang out in the power room deep in the lab.They walk on the ceiling and swoop
down at an enemy.Just fire a shot up to knock them down.Then aim down and kill em.
NOTE:there are many more enemies.These are the most frequently seen
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
3)
THE WEAPONS
  Every enemy has a weak spot.Even the bully down the street.
**The Beretta**You start with this.Its best at taking out dogs and zombies earlier in the game.
if you like to save ammo use this alot.
**The Shotgun**The best for killing zombies.Wait until the zombies are in close range and blow 
there heads off.
**The Combat Knife**The weakest weapon in the entire game.I don't even bother to use it.Its only
good when you have no ammo.
**The bazooka**Only Jill will get this.It has 3 different kinds of ammo.Acid,Explosive,and Flame
each good for taking out certain enemies.
**The Colt Python**The strongest weapon in the game(except for the rocket launcher)Its specialty
is killin Hunters in 1 or 2 shots.
**The Rocket Launcher**It claims to kill any enemy in one shot.I'll tell you now that thats a
total lie.It takes plenty of shots to kill the snake with it.And plenty of shots to kill all
the other bosses.Except for Tyrant this is the only boss it kills in one shot.But don't get
me wrong its still the strongest weapon.

 **THE BEGINNING**
    I hope you  enjoyed the really cool intro.It scared me half to death.I hope you were
 scared too!Ok maybe it was really cheap but thats what all B movies are like.And I love B
 movies.Well you'll arrive at the mansion.Jill and Barry are worried about Chris.Wesker has
 a sense of duty and refuses to let you go out.Just when you think all hope is lost a gun shut
 is heard.It came from the Dinning Room.Jill and Barry depart to go and investigate.

 <CHAPTER ONE>
THE DINNING ROOM
 (no items here at this point of the game)
 Make you way down the dinning room.Barry will spot a huge blood stain on floor.Is it Chris's
blood?He tells you to go on ahead.So travel thru the door on the right.You will arrive in an
L-shaped room.Look around until you find a zombie.He'll get up and chase you.Run all the way
to the end of the hall.Leer to 1 side and run around the zombie back to the dead body.Search it
and you'll find out it was Kenneth.Search it 2 more times to pic up the 2 clips on the body.Now 
leave the room.(you can kill the zombie if you like but there is no point in doing so).
Barry will use his magnum to scatter some zombie brains all over.Now go back to the main hall.

THE MAIN HALL
 lock pic(from barry)
 ink ribbon
 You'll enter the main hall and find that Wesker,like Chris,has disappeared.Run behind the 
stairs and run right back out.Barry will go on about stuff and will eventually give you the
lock pic since Jill is the master of unlocking.When you regain control search the type writer
to receice ink ribbons.Now go thru the blue doors on the right.

ROOM BEHiND BLUE DOORS
 ink ribbon
 1st floor map
  This is the first room you'll see that has been changed since the original.Move the step stool
against the statue to pic up the 1st floor map.Then go move the table away from the doorway.
Go on thru but kill the 2 zombies on the floor.Then search the shelves to pick up ink ribbons.
Exit this little room.And go thru the other door using the lockpick.

ANOTHER L-SHAPED ROOM
 clip
 When you enter this room walk backwards.NO QUESTIONS JUST DO IT!Suddenly a dog will jump
thru the window.Kill it quick.Continue walking until another dog will want you for dinner.

room and enter a room with 3 zombies.Kill them and go pick up the shot gun off the wall.Exit 
the room.In the small room the ceiling will start to FALL!!!!Both doors are locked.Are you going
to die?After a few seconds of this,Jill will talk to herself.Then Barry will bust the door down.
You engage in a small conversation.But why is Barry on this side of the mansion?Proceed thru the
double doors.3 zombies will be waiting for you in this room.Kill them and pass the first 2 doors
Enter the 3rd door on the left.

4.middle aged man
5.a bold looking old man
6.And lastly "the end of life"
 Now the picture will fall and you can grab the Wind crest.Exit the room.And go thru the door
that you must unlock.Kill the 2 zombies and enter the door on the right.Its a save room.Drop
everything except:Beretta,Clip,and some ink ribbons.Now SAVE the game.

Where's Barry?
   Put the ink ribbons back in the box.Now leave this room.Head up the stairs,kill the zombies.
Head down and go down to the last door.You'll now be in a red room surrounded by 2 zombies.Shoot
has fast as you can.Then head up and pass thru that door.This room is filled with books.Search 
the book on the table.Its the Botany Book.Now exit back into the red hall.Go down to the last 
door in the hall.You'll now be back in the main hall.The upper main hall.Travel left to the 
door.Go thru the next room until you reach the balcony.Search Forest's body.HE'LL COME to life 
and attack you.Fight him like you would a zombie.Then go back and pick up the Armor Key and the
bazooka.Go bacl to the upper main hall and meet with Barry.He'll give you acid rounds.You both 
agree to find a back door to get out of here.Only if it was so easy!

The Search for the Crests
  The only way to unlock the backdoor is to find the 4 crests.You already have one.Head straight
across the hall to the Upper Dining Room.Kill the 3 zombies.Now push the statue over the edge.
Go thru the door all the way at the end of the room.Watch out there's a zombie right when you
walk in.Kill it!But watch out there's 2 more.Travel down the stairs.Dogs will jump thru the 
windows.So kill them all before entering any rooms.Once there all dead enter the room that needs
the armor key to enter it.First search the desk.Get the shells after picking the lock.Then go
pick up the clip and the Colt Python.Leave the room and go to the room under the stairs.(its
not really under the stairs just near there.)Its a save room.Drop off everything but the Beretta
a clip,and an armor key.Now go to the end of the hall and enter the door.

hidden in a small closet.If you want to change your clothes go thru the other door.Go back to
the main hall and travel up stairs.Go to the red hall and unlock the Big Green Doors.

The gas room
  Push the statues over the grates on the floor and then push the red button in the middle.If 
you haven't covered them completely get ready for a gassy death.NOT FART GAS.But I guess zombies
would have pretty nasty farts.If you done it right you can go get the emblem.Go back to the

the first corner.Past the green doors and turn another corner and enter the first door there.In 
this room turn the corner and enter the door using the armor key.It doesn't matter which you 
enter first.When you get to the room with a desk and a bug collection on the wall search the bug
wall and press the switch.Now move the fish tank out of the way and then push the closet out 
of the way to reveal a hidden item.Half of the moon crest.Dirty Capcom they just couldn't bare
to give it to us whole!But don't worry they hid it some where in the mansion.Now go to the 
save room.SAVE THE GAME. and take these with you:bazooka, acid rounds,and the sword key,and

BOSS STRATEGY:The giant spider
 suggested weapon:bazooka w/flame rounds
 suggested heal:combined herbs with a blue one in it
 My strategy was to stand there and fire has fast as I could.But that strategy is very

strategy is easier but less fast.When the fight is over run out of the room and re enter.This
will get rid of those little spiders.Run to the corner and grab the combat knife.Slach the door
with all the webs on it.Once the web is gone enter it.

   There are a few differrent endings in Resident Evil.It depends on who you save.As Jill you 
 have the choice to save Barry and Chris.You do not have to save them,but if you want the good
 ending you will need to save them.To save Barry just follow this FAQ.To save Chris you need to
 find the 3 Mo Disks.There locations are in the FAQ above.Once you have the disks go to the lab
 and find the input machines.Use the mo disks to get the passcode and go to the jail.

GETTING AN EASIER ADVANCED MODE
  To get double ammo in advanced mode just go to start a new game.Go down to advanced and hold 
right until the letters turn green.When they do start a new game and whenever you pick up
ammo it will be double.
