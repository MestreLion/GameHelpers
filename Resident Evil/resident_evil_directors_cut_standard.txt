FAQ POLICY: 
-----------
With 2003 in as of this writing, I have created a new policy for my 
FAQs. Please follow this policy.

E-MAIL POLICY: I no longer answer e-mails about anything found in these 
guides. My FAQs comprehensively answer the questions, and any e-mail 
about content found IN the guides is not tolerated. Please read this and 
make sure what you're e-mailing is within bounds of answering. If I 
haven't answered a question of yours, then you overstepped the 
boundaries. 

HOSTING POLICY: These following websites can host all of my guides in 
one form of another. NO MORE WEBSITES MAY HOST MY GUIDES UNLESS THEY 
HAVE ANY FORM OF COMPENSATION. It's not very fair to have one website 
offer me something, and another one not offer me anything. It's not a 
greed factor, or anything personal, it's just that some websites do much 
better than others to refavor me for my own hard work, and rewarded they 
shall be.

COPYRIGHT POLICY: All my FAQs have copyrights starting 2002. Any 
copyrights before that are ineffective as of January 1, 2003. You 
probably don't care, so don't violate the copyright and you'll be fine.

Sorry to waste your time reading this, but it has to be said in the form 
of the new year.

RESIDENT EVIL: DIRECTOR'S CUT: FAQ/WALKTHROUGH
SONY PLAYSTATION
CREATED BY: CVXFREAK
COPYRIGHT 2001/2002 BY: CVXFREAK
VERSION 2.1

This FAQ may appear at:

www.gamefaqs.com
www.neoseeker.com

========================================================================

I N T R O D U C T I O N

========================================================================

Resident Evil: Director's Cut is the first Resident Evil for PlayStation 
(Psone), with added features. The Director's Cut features 2 additional 
game modes in addition to the original. Basically, that is all the extra 
features of the Director's Cut.

Resident Evil (BioHazard in Japan) is known by most Sony, Nintendo and 
Sega fans as a survival horror game. In 2002, 6 years after the 
original, the series has shifted from Sony to Sega and now is exclusive 
to Nintendo GameCube. The remake of the first Resident Evil is 
unparalleled in terms of graphics and survival horror gameplay.

Resident Evil for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and PC started the saga. 
The Director's Cut, which this FAQ is for, extends, in a very little 
way, what the original RE did.

Since I've beaten Resident Evil for Nintendo GameCube countless times 
between the US and Japanese versions, I decided to go play the 
PlayStation version using my older FAQ for it. 

After seeing the difference in quality between the FAQ for the original 
Resident Evil and the remake, I decided to "remake" my FAQ for the 
PlayStation versions. The old walkthrough will basically be non-
existent, and a new format will be used for this game. That format is 
basically the same as my GameCube Resident Evil FAQ.

So enjoy the game that pioneered it all. Resident Evil.

B. FIGHTING TACTICS
-------------------

EVADE ZOMBIES!
Yes, the zombies are somewhat hard. The Handgun takes 3-4 shots to kill
them. And no, the Knife isn't as powerful as it was in CODE: Veronica X.

CONSERVE AMMO!
Resident Evil is fairly hard. It is easy to use up a lot of ammo. The 
Tyrant, and Hunters require a lot of ammo. To conserve ammo throughout 
the game, strictly use your Handgun.

FIRE FROM A DISTANCE!
Hunters and Chimeras are extremely versatile when close up to Chris and
Jill. You will want to get to a distance and fire guns like the Shotgun, 
BAZOOKA and Handgun. When it comes to zombies, try to shoot them at 
close range.

TRY TO DECAPITATE ZOMBIES!
When playing, the SHOTGUN and sometimes the HANDGUN can blow a zombie's 
head off. As Chris, he'll blow a zombie head off with the HANDGUN more 
often than Jill can. For a SHOTGUN SHELL to decapitate a zombie, get 
close and aim it up, and then fire. 

KEEP 1 GREEN HERB AND 1 FIRST AID SPRAY WITH YOU!
Sometimes you can drop health because some monsters are stronger than 
others. Avoid this by carrying a Green herb and First Aid Spray. The 
Green Herb can cover small damage, while the First Aid Spray can cover 
sudden health drops from Hunters or Chimeras.

MAKE MULTIPLE SAVES!
Make at least 3 saves. Make one for the mansion, and progress on the 
game, but save onto another spot (preferably the post-Plant 42 fight). 
Those are definite save areas. If you keep multiple saves, you can then 
start from and older save if you mess up (EX: Use up too much ammo).

C. DIFFICULTY LEVEL
-------------------

STANDARD
This is the original Resident Evil. This can be considered "NORMAL 
MODE." Ammo is somewhat scare, and enemies are somewhat difficult to 
kill. The characters have a fair amount of health. This is what the 
walkthrough is based on.

TRAINING
This is the original Resident Evil, but much easier. The characters can 
withstand more damage, and the ammo is double. Enemies are easier to 
kill. This walkthrough can also be used for this mode. It is the same 
thing with double ammo.

ADVANCED
This is an insanely difficult mode. Monsters are so hard to kill, and 
the characters die only after 2 or 3 zombie bites. Ammo is scare and all 
items have been rearranged and put in different locations. This is for 
the seasoned Resident Evil player only. This FAQ won't cover this mode 
for obvious reasons.

D. HEALTH
---------

Throughout the game are healing items that will help you recover from 
injuries induced by the monsters and object in the game. They are 
limited, and the different medicines have different effects. Use them 
wisely. Along with weapons, these are your best friends. 

****************
HEALTH STANDARDS
****************

FINE (GREEN) = 100% HEALTH
Little to no damage suffered.

CAUTION (YELLOW) = 75% HEALTH
Some damage suffered.

CAUTION (ORANGE) = 50% HEALTH
A lot of damage suffered.

DANGER (RED) = 25% HEALTH
Extreme amount of damage suffered. Near death.
 
POISON (PURPLE) = 100%-25% HEALTH
Poisoned by a monster, gradually loses health.

+-----------------------------------------------+
|This is a silver can with a spray nozzle on it.|
+-----------------------------------------------+

E. MOVEMENT
-----------

Jill and Chris both run and walk extremely quickly and straightforward. 
It takes only a little bit of work to move them, but you should 
definitely manage. Move them in a straight path, or else a zombie can 
kill them (and do it rather easily).

F. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHRIS AND JILL
-------------------------------------

Their adventures both change in certain areas, and Chris has no 
lockpick. He only has 6 slots, as opposed to Jill's 8. Jill hangs out 
with Barry Burton, while Chris hangs out with Rebecca Chambers. Chris 
Redfield also has the Lighter from the start, and the Flame Thrower, 
while Jill has the Lockpick, and BAZOOKA. Chris must use Small Keys.

========================================================================

3. C H A R A C T E R S

========================================================================

CHRIS REDFIELD
AGE: 25
Chris Redfield is a tough guy. He has a sister named Claire, whom 
you see in Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock/Value Plus/Platinum (in Extreme 
Battle Mode), and Resident Evil CODE: Veronica X. He is very protective, 
and is willing to go out of his way to save others he cares about. He 
also used to be in the Air Force, and can pilot any sort of air craft.

STARTING ITEMS: COMBAT KNIFE
                LIGHTER

EXCLUSIVE ITEMS: SMALL KEY
                 FLAME THROWER

PARTNER: Rebecca Chambers, Albert Wesker

JILL VALENTINE
AGE: 23
Jill is the smart type in the STARS Alpha Team. She is very good 
with the piano and knows how to mix chemicals. She's not as 
tough as Chris, in terms of stamina, but a lot smarter. She works 
pretty well with guns and knives, but not as good as Chris though. 
She also runs a lot slower. Jill can be arrogant at times, as 
evidence by her attitude in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.

STARTING ITEMS: BERETTA
                COMBAT KNIFE

EXCLUSIVE ITEMS: BAZOOKA
                 ACID ROUNDS
                 FLAME ROUNDS
                 EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS
                 LOCKPICK

PARTNER: Barry Burton

BARRY BURTON
AGE: 38
Barry loves his family so much. He'll do ANYTHING to keep his 
family safe. During the game, he becomes very helpful to Jill. But he 
seems to be hiding a secret and Jill eventually finds out. Will he make 
it? You control that...

REBECCA CHAMBERS
AGE: 18
Rebecca is the young medic of STARS Bravo Team. She is well trained 
and pretty smart for her age. She is a rookie at her work, but she 
can be well trusted. Her gun ability is amazingly good for her 
age. But she can get hurt a lot easier than Chris and Jill. 
Besides Chris and Jill, she's the only other character you control. 
Apparently, Rebecca Chambers went through hell before this game 
even started, in BioHazard Zero. Apparently, she doesn't like to 
show it.

STARTING ITEMS: HANDGUN
                FIRST AID SPRAY

EXCLUSIVE ITEMS: None

PARTNER: Chris Redfield

ALBERT WESKER
AGE: 38
Wesker is the cool type guy. He wears shades and never seems to take 
them off. When he gets to the mansion, he gets a little... shady. He 
vanishes every now and then and refuses to talk in detail to Chris and 
Jill. Is there something up his sleeve?

RICHARD AIKEN
AGE: 23
Richard Aiken is found near a corridor where a giant snake has bitten 
him. After you cure him with serum, he dies. His role in the game is to 
provide your character with the RADIO. 

BRAD VICKERS
AGE: 35
Brad Vickers is the pilot of the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team. As evidenced by
the introduction FMV, he is a wimp, and runs away after the other team
members are attacked by zombie dogs. A decent shooter at best, Brad
Vickers faces an unhappy death 3 months later, by an evil Tyrant, called
"Nemesis." After that, he was murdered again by Leon Kennedy, only Leon
shot him as a zombie. After the Raccoon City nuke, he is no more.

ENRICO MARINI
Age: 41
Enrico Marini is the leader of Bravo Team. He is a great leader, and
is unfortunately murdered after discovering a secret about the entire
affair of the game. He lead Bravo Team greatly.

A. MANSION
----------

************************************************************************
STARTING
************************************************************************
ITEMS: LOCKPICK
       CLIP
       MUSIC NOTES
       INK RIBBONS
       GREEN HERB
       SHOTGUN
       STAR CREST
 
Watch the starting cut-scene of the game (or skip it). Then witness the 
scene in the MAIN HALL of the mansion. The game will start in the dining 
room.

Please note that when I say "left of Jill," I mean to the left in HER 
perspective. Her left is your right. And vice versa.

DINING ROOM
After you are able to control Jill, run down, passed the tables to the 
fire where Barry is (you should have the BERETTA armed). After another 
cut-scene, take the door to the right of where you are.

KENNETH HALL
From the door, turn a cautious left until you see a bigger area of the 
hall. Turn right, and you'll see a cut-scene featuring a zombie. After 
this, simply return to the door you just came from, back into the DINING 
ROOM.

DINING ROOM
Watch the cut-scene with Barry, and then return through the doubles 
doors across the hall.

MAIN HALL
After the cut-scene, run behind the grand staircase all the way to the 
other side, until you emerge back onto the main area. After yet another 
cut-scene with Barry, you'll finally get the crucial LOCKPICK. After 
Barry leaves, take the double doors back into the DINING ROOM.

DINING ROOM
Run down the room, and then through the single door at the end.

KENNETH HALL
Run down to Kenneth's corpse (the zombie's gone). Examine him several 
times to get 2 CLIPS for the BERETTA. Afterwards, head to the other end 
of the hallway and to the final door on Jill's left. Use the LOCKPICK to 
unlock it, and head through.

PIANO ROOM
Run to the piano and run to a small area passed it. There is a movable 
bookshelf in that small area. Move the shelf to the right and there will 
be MUSIC NOTES for you to grab. Take them, and then run to the piano. 
Use the MUSIC NOTES on the piano. After playing "Moonlight Sonata," a 
wall will rise. Once the wall rises, take your exit (for now).

KENNETH HALL
Run back to the DINING ROOM.

DINING ROOM
Run back to the MAIN HALL

MAIN HALL
If you want, grab the INK RIBBONS at the typewriter and save your game. 
Then take the blue double doors to the right of the room.

STATUE ROOM
In here is a statue. You can use the step ladder in the room to reach 
the map inside the pot of the statue, but it is a waste of time. If you 
push the cabinet away from the opening, you'll be in a long, red 
hallway. At the end are INK RIBBONS, but beware of the zombie. When 
you're ready, take to the only single door in this room and use the 
LOCKPICK to unlock it. Then go through.

DOG HALL
Run down the hallway, passed the windows. Zombie dogs will pop through 
the windows, so run down the hallway to the single door at the end.

DOOR HALLWAY
There is a GREEN HERB to Jill's left. After grabbing it, run passed the 
locked door. You'll see another door, but don't go through it; you don't 
need to. Once you see a single door to Jill's left, take that door.

CEILING ROOM
This is a big, square, empty room. There is another door across from 
where Jill's at. So head through it. 

SHOTGUN ROOM
Run passed the coffee table and grab the SHOTGUN from the rack. You'll 
notice the little hinges rise. Ignore this and return to the CEILING 
ROOM.

CEILING ROOM
Now, you'll notice that the ceiling is slowly falling to the ground. Try 
opening all doors in this room, and keep doing it until you see another 
cut-scene with Barry Burton. After the cut-scene, you will be in the 
DOOR HALLWAY.

DOOR HALLWAY
After Barry leaves, go through the double doors across from Jill.

DOOR HALLWAY 2
There are 2 zombies in here, so kill them with the BERETTA. Then take 
the unlocked door to the left of Jill. 

CROW HALL
Run down the room, and you'll see several paintings. Here are crows on a 
rest line above, but they will not hurt you at all (unless you do 
something wrong in the next puzzle). There is the first puzzle of the 
game to solve here.

[PAINTING PUZZLE]
Here are the named of each painting:

Newborn Child 
Infant 
Lively Boy 
Young Man
Tired Middle Aged Man,
Bold-Looking Old Man
The End of Life 

Now press them in that exact order and the final painting you press will 
reveal the STAR CREST. 
[PAINTING PUZZLE]

With the STAR CREST on hand, exit the CROW HALL.

DOOR HALLWAY 2
From the door Jill's at, run straight across to a small branch of the 
hallway. At the very end is a door. Run through.

EXIT HALL
We are outside, so run down the hall. Near the end, you'll see a zombie 
dog, so kill it before it hurts you. Once the dog is dead, run down to 
the door at the end of this hall. It is locked. To the left of the door 
are 4 indentations that need to be filled to unlock the door. Insert the 
STAR CREST. Now return to the DOOR HALLWAY 2.

************************************************************************
CREST HUNTING
************************************************************************
ITEMS: GREEN HERB
       CHEMICAL
       BAZOOKA
       BLUE JEWEL
       ARMOR KEY
       GREEN HERB
       RED HERB
       CLIP
       SHOTGUN SHELLS
       WOODEN EMBLEM
       GOLD EMBLEM
       SHEILD KEY
       WIND CREST
       SERUM
       MOON CREST 
       RADIO 

DOOR HALLWAY 2
Run back to the bigger portion of the room, and to the door to the right 
of the locked one. 

RIGHT STAIRS
Run forward, and at the foot of the stairs is a zombie. Run back to the 
door, and shoot it from there, so you don't get hurt by it. After it's 
gone, turn right at the foot of the stairs. There should be a GREEN HERB 
right there. Grab it. Then take the door to the right of Jill.

RIGHT STAIRS SAVE ROOM
This is a save room. The item box in the corner (which should have INK 
RIBBONS and CLIPS) stores items you don't need. Store the COMBAT KNIFE 
in there. Withdraw all the CLIPS inside and combine them with your 
current amount of CLIPS. See the supplies to the right of the item box? 
Examine them for a CHEMICAL. Then go to the typewriter and save the game 
if you like. Deposit the INK RIBBONS and you should then be ready to go. 
Exit the room.

RIGHT STAIRS
Run to the stairs and climb them.

UPPER RIGHT STAIRS
There is a zombie to Jill's left which should be really easy to kill. At 
the turn to Jill's right, is a another zombie. Kill it. There is a door 
you cannot go through, but to the left is an unlocked door. Go through.

U HALL
All the doors in here are locked for now. So turn to Jill's left and 
follow the corridor until you reach a door at the end. Unlock it and go 
through. 

UPPER MAIN HALL
We are on the second floor of the main hall. Barry will be here, and 
give you ACID ROUNDS. After he leaves, turn to Jill's left and there 
should be a single door there. Go through.

BLOODY HALLWAY
Run down this narrow hallway. At the end is a door. Go through it.

FOREST BALCONY
Run away from the door and you'll see the corpse of Bravo Team member 
Forest Speyer. On him is a BAZOOKA. Grab it, and then crows will attack 
you. Run away from them before they hit. 

BLOODY HALLWAY
Return to the UPPER MAIN HALL.

UPPER MAIN HALL
Run across the hall to the only door on the left side.

UPPER DINING ROOM
From Jill's vantage point, dispatch all the zombies in the room. Once 
that's done, head over to the statue on the left side of the room. Push 
it forward, and then push it off the balcony onto the floor below. After 
that's done, take the door at the other end of the room. 

UPPER LEFT STAIRS
Run to the stairs area, and kill all the zombies you see (if you still 
have BERETTA ammo left). Once that's done, head downstairs.

LOWER LEFT STAIRS
There are more zombies here to take out. Scan the entire hall and kill 
all the zombies. Then head to the door at the foot of the stairs. 

LEFT STAIRS SAVE ROOM
Save and unload anything you want (keep as much ammo as you can, 
though). Then exit.

LOWER LEFT STAIRS 
Run all the way down the hallway, passed the locked door. At the end, go 
through the door.

J HALL
Check the map- the room looks like a J. Run down from Jill's position 
and turn right at the end. Kill any zombies in here with the BAZOOKA. At 
the end is a doorway. Go through.

VINE ROOM
Turn to the area to the left of Jill. In the water pump, place the 
CHEMICAL in there, and the vines nearby will die. Go to the shield 
behind the dead vines and grab the ARMOR KEY (MANSION KEY at first, but 
check the key entirely to change the names. Do this to all keys). Once 
you have all that, feel free to grab all the HERBS in this room. You can 
leave them here and pick them up later if you want. Exit.

J HALL
Head back to the first door you entered this room from, and turn to 
Jill's left from there. There should be a door to her right, which you 
can unlock with the LOCKPICK. Go through.

BEDROOM
Grab the CLIP on the bed. Examine the desk and a zombie will attack you. 
Kill it by any means and then head to the closet where it was hiding. 
Grab the SHOTGUN SHELLS. After getting them, grab the file on the desk, 
and then exit. 

J HALL
Straight across from the door Jill's at is another branch of the 
hallway. There is a door there, but don't go through it yet. To the 
right of the door leading to the bedroom should be unlocked. Then go 
through.

KENNETH HALL
We are back in the KENENTH HALL. Take the door to the DINING ROOM.

DINING ROOM
Run to where the statue fell and grab the BLUE JEWEL. Once you have it, 
run to the fireplace and grab the WOODEN EMBLEM right above it. Then

**********************************BOSS 1********************************
YAWN SNAKE
DIFFICULTY: Easy
This boss isn't too hard. Just pump 5 or 6 ACID ROUNDS into it before it 
dies. If the Yawn poisons you, heal with normal HERBS and then keep 
fighting. After Yawn Snake dies, look near the hole it climbed through.

-------------------------------------
Whew! That mansion was evil, and we're out of it- for now! We'll be 
returning to the mansion after the GUARDHOUSE AREA to explore some of 
the still-locked doors in the mansion, but it'll be a small detour. For 
now, we explore the GARDEN and GUARDHOUSE in hopes of finding a way off 
this estate safely.

B. GUARDHOUSE
-------------

************************************************************************
GARDEN AREA
************************************************************************
ITEMS: SQUARE CRANK
       GREEN HERB
       BLUE HERB
       RED HERB
SHED
You're in a SHED. See the ladder? Push it toward the shelf on the wall 
and climb the steps. Grab the SQUARE CRANK. Then head through the door 
at the other end of this room.

GARDEN
There are 2 RED HERBS and a couple of GREEN HERBS here. Turn the corner 
for some BLUE HERBS. If you have the RADIO, Brad Vickers will radio you. 
You can answer it (or ignore it). Answer it by selecting the RADIO 
option in your item screen. After that, dispatch all the zombie dogs in 
this room with the SHOTGUN or HANDGUN. Once they're dead, turn to the 
arm of the room to the right of the BLUE HERBS. At the end is a lift. 
Remember this lift for later. Returning to the main part of the area, 
turn to Jill's left and up a set of steps through a gate.

POND ROOM
Run over to the pond, and turn to Jill's left. Turn to her right at a 
turn and at the end should be a mechanism. Use the SQUARE CRANK to drain 
the water in the pond. After it drains, move to the pond and jump down. 
Run across and up the ladder at the other end. Once back up, follow the 
pathway to a lift. Watch out for the snakes in this area. Take the lift 
down.

WATERFALL ROOM
There are zombie dogs in here for you to kill. Once they're dead, look 
for another lift in this room. It is the same lift as the one in the 
GARDEN. It doesn't work, and you'll need a BATTERY for it to work. That 
is the goal for the next mission: to grab that BATTERY. Look at the 
waterfall in the room. There is a tunnel passed it. We need to stop the 
waterfall. But when you drained the pond, the water ended up flowing in 
front of the tunnel. How can we get passed it without draining the pond? 
Simple; we need to use the other lift to get here, which means finding 
the battery for it. After all the cross examining, take the gate in this 
room.

**********************************BOSS 2********************************
PLANT 42
DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY EASY
Keep firing the Shotgun or Beretta. Eventually, the Plant will look like 
it's dying. But then it comes back and constricts Jill with a vine. 
Suddenly, Barry comes in with a FLAMETHROWER and destroys Plant 42! 
Saved by Barry!

                      ***ALTERNATE PATH***
If you don't want help from Barry, go to the room with a pad next to it 
in the WASP ROOM. Type the password "315" in the pad to unlock the door.  
Go through to the V-JOLT Room. Grab the 4 Empty Bottles. You may need to 
return to the GUARDHOUSE SAVE ROOM.

Ok, first out water into one bottle. Then look on a shelf and put UMB. 2 
into another bottle. Combine the water and and UMB. 2 to create 
something called NP-003. Then Go to another shelf and collect UMB. 4 in 
another empty bottle. Combine UMB. 4 and NP-003 to make UMB. 7. Now use 
another bottle and collect some more UMB. 2. Now go use another bottle 
and collect some UMB. 4. Combine UMB. 2 and UMB. 4 to create Yellow 6.

Then combine Yellow 6 and UMB. 7 to create UMB. 13. Now put some water 
into another empty bottle. Put some UMB. 2 into another bottle. Combine 
the water and UMB. 2 to make NP-003 again. Combine NP-003 with UMB. 13 
to make V-JOLT!!! YAY!

Now go back to the SHARK TANK and through the door you didn't go 
through. There, look for the plant root and apply the V-JOLT. The roots 
shrivel up. Now go into the 003 ROOM and grab the Flame Rounds in the 
003 Bathroom. Now go into the PLANT 42 ROOM. Kill Plant 42 easily with 
the FLAME ROUNDS and BAZOOKA.

GREAT! You killed Plant 42 without Barry's help!!!
                      ***END ALTERNATE PATH***

after you try to open the other door. Go through the door after Barry

door.

GIANT SPIDER ROOM
Yet another boss is here to fight you...

**********************************BOSS 4********************************
BLACK TIGER SPIDER
DIFFICULTY: VERY EASY
CODE: Veronica and CODE: Veronica X veterans will recognize this monster 
as the Giant Spider. But like in CODE: Veronica and CODE: Veronica X, 
this boss is pathetic, especially when you just fought Plant 42 and 
Yawn! Use the COLT PYTHON and cap the monster until it dies. EXPLOSIVE 
ROUNDS are also effective. 
**********************************BOSS 4********************************

See the shining item in the corner? It's a COMBAT KNIFE exactly like the

there. Use it _THREE_ times. Then take the small passage to the left and 
through the door.

Look for the hole with the HEX CRANK shape and use it for a block of 
wall to move away. Turn the HEX Crank again for the wall to retreat. 
Then use the statue and push it to where the wall would move. Use the 
HEX CRANK again and the statue can now be pushed over the button on the 
floor. Push it and a little compartment in the room opens. Inside is 
DOOM BOOM 2. Check the innards for a WOLF MEDAL. Exit. 

BOULDER ROOM 2
Now turn left from the small niche and go until the camera angle 
changes. Now head back and the boulder will begin to move. Run into the

-------------------------------------
Well, we made it into the lab. The puzzles in the mansion, the traps in 
the tunnel and the existence of that stupid waterfall in the GARDEN were 
meant to hide this place, so it must be important. What's down here? 
Well, let's go find out!

If you pre-ordered the American Version of Resident Evil CODE: Veronica 
X, bought the Japanese PS2 or DC version of CODE: Veronica Complete, or 
bought the BioHazard 5th Anniversary Briefcase, you got the Wesker's 
Report DVD. 

If you didn't, it's here for you to read, because it bursts with seams 
of the original PSX RE, RE2 and RE3 information. Others may hate the 
Report because they can't think what Capcom is aiming with that, but I 
love it!

Sure, the information for the "Mansion Incident" may seem a little 
outdated when the GameCube remake is accounted for, since it covers the 
original PlayStation version, but it still contains the basic 
information about the storyline of Resident Evil. 

This can also help those folks out who have just started the series on 
GameCube, and want to find out more about Resident Evil 2 and Resident 
Evil 3: Nemesis, until the GameCube ports of those games come out. In 
any case, here is Wesker's Report I in its entirety.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

============
INTRODUCTION
============
"My name is Albert Wesker. I aspired to become a leading researcher at
Umbrella Inc. A pharmaceutical enterprise who covertly conduction Bio
Organic Weapons, better known as B.O.W., for development. But at the
leader development training ground situated in Raccoon City, I met a
brilliant and talented researcher who decided to take a different path;
William Birkin.

In time I shifted my position to S.T.A.R.S., a special force unit of
the Raccoon Police Department. Umbrella, for crisis management reasons
of their illegal Bio Organic Weapons development had many of its people
working in the police department.

I became the leader of S.T.A.R.S. and conducted all sorts of
intelligence activities for Umbrella. As I continued to serve I devised
my own plans and waited for the right time moment to execute them. Then
at last, opportunity knocked.

==============
1998 July 24th
==============
The freak murder incidents that had occurred in the forest near the
mansion started it all. The mansion was Umbrella's secret BOW
laboratory and it was clear that the indevelopment T-Virus was the
cause of the murder. Initially, Umbrella instructed me secretively to
keep S.T.A.R.S. to the mansion, dispose of them, then report the
situation to headquarters so that their combat with the B.O.W. could be
used for data analysis allowing Umbrella a comprehensive portrait of
the B.O.W.'s combat abilities.

From the two S.T.A.R.S. teams I first pitched in the Bravo Team. As
expected, the top elite of S.T.A.R.S. gave all they had and became
useful sample data. Then following, I geared up the Alpha Team to
"search and rescue" the lost Bravo Team. The members of Alpha Team also
proved their worth and as expected many died.

There were five survivors from the initial eleven S.T.A.R.S. members.
From the Alpha team were Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Barry
Burton. And from the Bravo Team were Rebecca Chambers and Enrico
Marini. It was time to begin executing my plans.

In the midst of the whole affair I could take Umbrella's ultimate Bio-
Organic Weapon, the Tyrant, and join forces with an opposing
corporation of Umbrella. To buy into that opposing corporation I would
need the actual combat data of the Tyrant. The surviving privileged
members of S.T.A.R.S. were just the perfect bait.

I decided to have one of them play the Judas and draw them to the
Tyrant. That Judas was Barry. Barry was the strong truth and justice
kind and cherished his family more than anything. His type is easy to
manipulate. I just took that most important thing away from him.

My only miscalculation was the high potential of Chris and Jill. But
with the family man Barry playing Judas the scheme went as planned.
Then the winds turn unexpectedly. I had to eliminate Enrico who found
out what was behind it all. I used Barry to get to him.

After I successfully got rid of that nuisance I awaited the sample
specimen that Barry would bring to me in the Tyrant room. I injected
the virus I obtained from Birkin in advance. If I made Umbrella believe
I was dead, it made it far more convenient to sell myself to the
opposing corporation.

According to Birkin the virus had profound effects. It would put my
body in a state of temporary "death". It would then bring me back to
life with super human powers. Therefore I unleashed an awesome Tyrant
from its slumber and let it attack me. As my consciousness faded away I
was certain that the whole scheme would end in success.

Never did I imagine that S.T.A.R.S. could slay the evil creation. I
lost the Tyrant and the plan I devised which cost me my humanity ended
in failure. Now anything and anyone who stood in my way would be
terminated. It's been that way for a long time and it always will be.
At all costs I had to make S.T.A.R.S. pay.

=========
September
=========
Two months had passed since the mansion incident.

To regain everything I had lost in my new organization I joined hands
with Ada Wong, a female agent who was also sent to spy on Umbrella. I
knew in my bones that the key developer was William Birkin, but what he
didn't know was that Umbrella did not play games...with anyone.

Eventually, Birkin would be assassinated, and the G-virus would be in
the hands of Umbrella. But the salvage team led by Hunk was ahead of
us. By the time they got to Birkin, he'd already injected himself with
the G-virus...he became his own creation, and decimated them. Soon
after, the T-virus carried by rats spread throughout Raccoon City, and
Umbrella faced its worst scenario.

==============
September 28th
==============
The good citizens became zombies, and the city had headed for its
devastating fate. Humans were no match against zombies. In the chaos,
Umbrella Europe applied a new type B.O.W., called "Nemesis". The
Nemesis would hunt down and destroy the surviving member of S.T.A.R.S.,
Jill. It became imperative that our organization would also obtain the
Nemesis data.

==============
September 29th
==============
To cover up the whole affair, Umbrella jettisoned a Tyrant to take care
of Leon and Claire, who were trying to unveil their secrets. Then,
there was a new revelation. Birkin used to hide the findings of his
studies in his daughter Sherry's pendant.

It was very possible that the G-virus was there. While Umbrella was
busy with their cover up, we had to capture Sherry before they did. I
sent Ada undercover to seek the location of Sherry. I, the "dead man"
on the other hand, had to work in the shadows.

A spy's obligation and priority is in mission, to carry out the mission
like a machine without any emotional interference. But through her
interaction and involvement with Leon Scott Kennedy, there had been an
affection growing inside her. My instincts sensed danger. Something had
to be done, quickly. My instincts did not disappoint me.

Even though Ada almost had her hands on the G-virus, which Leon had
acquired from Sherry, that affection of her drove her to her death. But
she was still of some use. I had to save her life. My people hurried to
retrieve the G-virus that Leon threw away.

But Hunk, the only survivor of Umbrella's salvage team, was there
before us.

==============
September 30th
==============
Our only option left was to bring back Birkin, the monster, as the
sample specimen and have him finish Leon and Claire in order to obtain
his combat data.

Although Birkin lost the battle to Leon and Claire, we succeeded in
gathering samples of the G-virus from his dead body.

===========
October 1st
===========
In the morning the government bombed Raccoon city in an attempt to stop
for the viral outbreak. This was, of course, their feigned reason...
Later, Claire left to Europe to find her lost brother Chris, and Leon
joined forces with an underground anti-Umbrella organization.

~ About Medical Herbs ~
As you may know, there are many plants that have medical effects. Since 
ancient times, humans have been healing wounds and diseases using 
various plants.

In this book, we're going to sample three herbs that grow around the 
Raccoon mountains and give their outlines as examples of those plants 
with medical properties.

Each herb has different colors and different effects as medical plants: 
the green one recovers physical strength, the blue one neutralizes 
natural toxins, while the red herb does not have any effect by itelf.

The red herb is only effective with other herbs. For example, if you mix 
this herb with the herb that recovers physical strength, the recovery 
effect will be tripled.

By adjusting the amount and experimenting with these three herbs, you 
can create various kinds of medicines but I'll leave the details in your 
hands because that's the best way to acquire true knowledge.

NOTES: This is about the healing herbs of red, blue and green.

May 9th 1998

At night, we played Poker with Scott the guard, Alias and Steve the 
Researcher. Steve was really lucky, but I think he was cheating. What a 
scumbag!

May 10th 1998
Today, a high ranking researcher asked me to take care of a new monster. 
It looks like a gorilla without any skin. They told me to feed them live 
food. When I threw in a pig, they were playing with it... tearing off 
the pig's legs and pulling out the guts before they actually ate it.

May 11th 1998
Around 5 o'clock this morning, Scott came in and woke me up suddenly. He 
was wearing a protection suit that looks like a space suit. He told me 
to put one on as well. I heard there was an accident in the basement 
lab. It's no wonder, those researchers never rest, even at night.

May 12th 1998
I've been wearing this annoying space suit since yesterday. My skin 
grows musty and feels very itchy. By way or revenge, I didn't feel those 
dogs today. Now I feel better.

May 13th 1998
I went to the medical room because my back is all swollen and feels 
itchy. They put a big bandage on my back and the doctor told me I did 
not need to wear the space suit any more. I guess I can sleep well 
tonight.

May 14th 1998
When I woke up this morning, I found another blister on my foot. It was
annoying and I ended up dragging my foot as I went to the dog's pen. 
They have been quiet since morning, which is unusual. I found that some 
of them escaped. I'll be in real trouble if some of the higher-ups find 
out.

May 15th 1998
Even though I didn't feel well, I decided to go see Nancy. It's my first 
day off in a long time but I was stopped by the guard on the way out. 
They say the company has ordered that no one leave the grounds. I can't 
even make a phone call. What kind of joke is this?!

May 16th 1998
I heard a researcher who tried to escape from this mansion was shot last 
night. My entire body feels burning and itchy at night. When I was 
scratching the swelling on my arms, a lump of rotten flesh dropped off. 
What the hell is happening to me?

May 19th 1998
Fever gone but itchy. Hungry and eat doggy food.
Itchy.
Tasty.

FILE: RESEARCHER'S WILL

My dear Alma,

The fact that you have received this letter is both a joy and sadness 
for me. I could not even talk to you because of that guy in the 
sunglasses. Alma, be calm and read this. I think I've told you that I 
moved to pharmaceutical company's lab. They headhunted me.

Last month, there was an accident in the lab and the virus we were 
studying escaped. All my colleagues who were infected by the virus are 
dead. To be accurate, they've become living dead. They still wander 
around. Some of them are knocking on my room door desperately right now.

But there's no sign of intelligence in their eyes. That cursed virus 
takes away all humanity from the human brain. Love, Joy, sorrow, fear, 
humor,... eternally. And Alma, even the memories of the days I spent 
with you... Yes, I'm infected. I did everything I could, but I could 
only delay the progress by a few days.

The most frightening thing is, that I forget more about you by the day. 
So I chose a peaceful death, rather than become the living dead. Within 
an hour, I will have entered my eternal sleep. I do hope you'll 
understand my decision...

Goodbye and Forever Yours,

Martin Crackhorn

FILE: PLANT 42 REPORT

4 days have passed since the accident and the plant at point 42 is 
growing amazingly fast. It has been effected by the T-virus differently 
than other plants have been and shows unique shape in addition to its 
size. Looking at the way it behaves, it is now difficult to determine 
what kind of plant it was originally. There are two ways in which Plant 
42 gathers nutrition.

The first is through its root that reaches into the basement. 
Immediately after the accident, a scientist went mad and broke the water 
tank in the basement. Now the basement is filled with water. It is 
easily imaginable that some chemical elements were blended in the water 
and promotes the incredibly fast growth of Plant 42.

Another part of Plant 42 from the basement grows through the duct and 
hangs down like so many bulbs from the ceiling of the first floor. Many 
vines come out of those bulbs and they are the second resource for its 
nutrition. Once sensing movement, Plant 42 shoots its vines around the 
prey and holds it. Then it starts sucking up blood, using the suckers 
located at the back of its vine. It also has some intelligence.

It blocks the door by twinning its vines around it especially when it 
captures prey or is sleeping. Several staff members have already fallen 
victim to this.

FILE: "V-JOLT" REPORT

As I started in the last report, there are some common features found in 
the cells of the plant infected by the Tyrant virus. We also have found 
another interesting fact through some experiments.

We found an element that destroys these rapidly in "UMB No.16", one of 
the series of UMB chemicals that we used for that experiment. We named 
this "UMB No.16" as "V-Jolt". In our calculation it will take less than 
5 seconds to destroy Plant 42 if we put the "V-jolt" directly on the 
root. You need to mix some of the UMB series chemicals in a specific 
order to create a "V-Jolt".

But the UMB series chemicals may generate a poisonous gas, which is 
harmful to the human body. Extreme caution should be taken when handling 
these chemicals. Following are the types of UMB series chemicals and 
their brief characteristics.

Animal Attack? Woman Mutilated May 20th. At around 10pm a 20-year-old 
young woman's body was found by a baser-by on the left bank of Marble 
River in the Older District of Raccoon City. Raccoon police assume it to 
be a grizzly or other animal's doing because there are teeth marks along 
her mutilated arms and left foot that show considerable power. Since she 
was wearing a hiking boot on her remaining foot, it has been determined 
that she was attacked in the Arklay Mountains and fell into the river. 
They are hurrying to identify this woman.

Monsters in Arklay Mountains? Some people claim they've seen monsters in 
the Arklay Mountains. The monsters are supposedly about the same size as 
large dogs and usually run in a pack as wolves do. This may sound like a 
group of ordinary wild dogs, but these monsters are surprisingly fierce 
and hard to hurt. They say these dogs won't bother you unless you wake 
them, so you smart readers should stay out of the Arklay Mountains for 
the time being. But if you're looking for adventure, check it out! You

Dear Ada,

Ada, by the time you read this, I'll be something... different. Today's 
test turned out to be positive, just as I expected. I feel like going 
crazy when I think about becoming one of them. Ada, you are not infected 
and I hope you never will be. In case you are the last one left, take 
the material in the Visual Data Room and go to the Power Room to operate 
the Triggering System before you escape.

And make all this public through the media. If everything is in order, 
all the locks can be opened by the security system. You can access the 
system if you log in with my name from the terminal in the small lab and 
enter the password. The password is your name.

To unlock the door at B2 where the Visual Data Room is located, you'll 
need to access with our name first and then enter another password. I've 
written the code below. I'm sure you'll understand it easily. And this 
is my last hope - if you find me completely changed, please kill me 
yourself.

This memorandum is strictly confidential and must be destroyed as soon 
as it is understood. Regarding the "T-virus" outbreak which occurred 
recently, this Committee conducted a field survey. According to the 
results, estimates on the amount of damage caused by the accident are 
considerably greater than reported earlier. First, although it is very 
difficulty to obtain accurate data in terms of actual numbers, it is 
thought that more than half of the researchers died after exposure to 
the "T-virus".

The body count will almost likely increase since nearly all of the 
survivors show symptoms peculiar to the "T-virus".

Second, our security system is still in operation. However, our special
security guard squad has been nearly destroyed. Because of that, 
research information considered by our company to be top secret has been 
made available to outsiders. Counter-measures should be taken as soon as 
possible.

Finally, many of the "subjects" from the experiments have escaped and 
are out of control. We believe that some of the researchers were killed 
by these "subjects" and their bodies were mutilated. By a curious 
coincidence, these events are proof of the success of our research. 
However, there is also a very high risk that his news may be leaked to 
the press if we don't act immediately.

The condition is very serious. Our operation to cover-up the situation 
is difficult to attain, however we hope the problem will be solved 
quickly. We are especially concerned that the State Police and 
S.T.A.R.S. are intervening too quickly. We need to act on this situation 
as well.

RESIDENT EVIL 1 (REBIRTH VERSION)
=================================
NOTE: This synopsis combines Chris and Jill's games.

July 1998

Raccoon City, a mid-western U.S. town is experiencing reports of
cannibalism near its forest. The local police department sends in a
special force to stop it, called STARS, Special Tactics and Rescue
Service, to seek information about it. Umbrella Inc, a pharmaceutical,
also controls Raccoon City. The STARS are divided into 2 teams, Bravo
and Alpha. Bravo heads in first. Bravo team is consisted of Rebecca
Chambers, Enrico Marini, Forest Speyer, Richard Aiken, Ed Dewey and
Kenneth Sullivan. Enrico Marini was the team's leader.

Bravo Team heads to the forest in the Arklay Mountains. They
investigate the origins of the zombies that wandered into Raccoon City.
A day later, Alpha Team loses communication with Bravo Team. Albert
Wesker decides to send in the other STARS Team to find them.

When their helicopter sees wreckage, they land. Wesker, Jill, Joseph,
Barry and Chris examine the chopper. Inside are the remains of Kevin,
the pilot of the Bravo Team. Joseph looks around, and is shocked by the 
sounds he hears. As he searches... he sees nothing.

Suddenly, a skinless dog mauls Joseph. Jill Valentine, nearby, shoots 
the dogs several times, but the dogs don't seem to feel the bullets (or 
she's missing; it isn't clear). She runs out of ammo, and after the dogs 
finish Joseph off, a dog lunges toward Jill. Chris shoots the dog just 
before it gets Jill, and Jill and Chris start running for the others. 

Brad Vickers, the pilot, flies away because he is scared of the monsters 
he sees. Chris pauses in shock, and a dog is about to lunge at him, but 
Wesker saves Chris and shoots the dog into its death.

After a merry dash to avoid the zombie dogs, the remaining STARS members 
run into a nearby mansion which belonged to Umbrella, Inc. It was the 
home of Ozwell Spencer in the 1960's, and was supposedly abandoned for 
years. Inside, Jill, Barry and Wesker realize Chris is missing. They 
hear a gunshot nearby, and Jill and Barry check it out. 

Jill Valentine and Barry Burton discover the destroyed body of Kenneth
Sullivan of Bravo Team. Jill seems suspicious as she and Barry discover 
Forest Speyer's body, because of Barry's weird attitude. 

As Jill and Barry separate, Chris reaches the guardhouse behind the 
mansion, passed the courtyard. There, Chris and Rebecca duel with a 
vicious and giant plant called Plant 42. They destroy the plant with the 
help of a chemical and a little luck from draining a shark of its water. 

Jill, back at the mansion, destroys a giant snake. She then explores the 
basement of the mansion. Chris and Rebecca head to the mansion with 
nowhere else to go for now. There, they discover the scarred snake that 
Jill just fought. With new ammo from the guardhouse, the snake dies for 
good.

As Chris and Rebecca look around, a new type of monster invades the
mansion. It's called the Hunter. They are a lot worse than the zombies
Jill, Barry, Chris and Rebecca have been running into.

[Jill finds her way outside the mansion. She finds a cottage beside the 
mansion and its courtyard. Looking around, she is momentarily knocked 
out by a creature in chains. After regaining consciousness, she tries to 
shoot her attacker, but it seems she cannot even hurt the thing with 
even a Magnum (which she found in a graveyard beside the courtyard). 
Running away, she too explores the guardhouse. She hears a conversation 
with Barry and someone else, with Barry muttering something about his 
family. Barry discovers Jill and tells her that he was talking to 
himself. (O_O)]

Jill finds her way into the underground tunnels with Barry. There, Jill
finds Enrico Marini. He tells Jill Umbrella had planned this just
before he is shot by a traitor. Marini was killed right before he can 
expose the perpetrator. 

[Jill chases the killer into some weird tunnel, where after a long
chase, she finds Barry Burton. Taking a lift down into a big pit, she 
runs into that monster that attacked her in her in the cottage. Dodging 
it, she finds that Barry has ridden the lift up to abandon her. She gets 
irritably pissed off at that stunt.] 

[Dodging that thing once more, she finds a ladder leading up to the 
cottage where she was knocked out by that inhumane creature. Circling 
back to the mansion, she discovers a pathway to an altar, beneath where 
it all started; the mansion main hall.]

[She sees Barry there, mysteriously. After an argument where Barry 
attempts to ambush Jill, that creature now known as Lisa returns (the 
chains monster), and a clear view shows it has tentacles and a giant eye 
on her back. Jill gives Barry his gun back, and Barry and Jill shoot the 
thing until it falls into a deep pit. Barry volunteers to keep out for 
it, in case it returns.]

Jill follows the path into a lab from the altar.

Finding some notes Jill and Barry left near some typewriters, Chris
and Rebecca find their way to the tunnels. Chris and Rebecca kill a
Giant Spider and find their way into a lab.

Jill discovers Barry and Wesker were working together to kill all the
STARS and to collect combat data. Barry didn't want to, but his family 
was in danger. Wesker also  is planning to blow the lab up, and to 
betray Umbrella Inc. Barry betrays Wesker and gets him to get impaled by 
Tyrant, Wesker's creation. 

[Barry is knocked unconscious by the Tyrant. Jill battles the thing, and 
wins a close battle, thanks to a Grenade Launcher. Barry recovers from 
the Tyrant's attack. Outside the Tyrant room, they realize that the 
mansion is now going to explode. How?]

Jill and Barry hurry out of the mansion. They run into Chris and 
Rebecca, and join each other to escape. They make it to the roof of the 
mansion, but the Tyrant has recovered from Jill's assault and catches up 
to the quartet.

[Chris Redfield is knocked out by the Tyrant on the roof. Jill, Barry 
and Rebecca use their weapons to kick the Tyrant's ass. No weapons work, 
however, but Brad Vickers sends a bazooka out of the helicopter window 
after flying about the mansion roof.]

[Chris recovers and catches the launcher, and destroys the Tyrant with 
it. After the thing is destroyed, all 4 people get on the helicopter and 
escape into the morning right before the mansion explodes.

===============================
RESIDENT EVIL 3 NEMESIS: PART 1
===============================
SEPTEMBER 1998

Chris, Jill, Barry and Rebecca must stop Umbrella for spreading the
virus through the mansion. Chris and presumably Rebecca go to Europe to
take out Umbrella, while Jill and Barry stay behind.

On the 22nd, a scientist named William Birkin finishes his G- Virus, an
upgrade of the T- Virus. Umbrella, impatient, sends a squat team that
attacks Birkin and steals his virus. Birkin injects himself with his G-
Virus and becomes a monster. He kills off the squat members. Because
Birkin is now a monster, he causes a T- Virus leak and now the Raccoon
citizens are zombies, courtesy of a virus spread through rats in the
sewer.

SEPTEMBER 28, 1998

Jill Valentine escapes infection. On the 28th of September, armed with
an Assault Rifle, Jill fights her way out of town. She runs into Brad
Vickers, the pilot of STARS. He tells Jill that something is coming for
STARS members. What?

As Jill makes it into the RPD Building, that thing Brad was speaking of
arrives. Brad Vickers is murdered by the Nemesis. Jill's weapons don't
damage it too much, so she retreats into the RPD Building.

[The Nemesis bears a jump and tentacles similar to that of what Lisa
had in the Spencer Estate. Hmmm.]

The RPD STARS Office is untouched on the RPD second floor. Jill finds a 
Magnum, which is effective against Nemesis. After finding a set of lock-
picks, Jill fights her way out of the RPD. Nemesis returns, but Jill's 
Assault Rifle and her new Magnum are powerful enough to put the thing 
down, but it rises up again quickly.

Jill runs as fast as she can, loses the Nemesis and reaches the
downtown area. She runs into a man named Carlos Oliveira. He is part of
Umbrella BioHazard Countermeasure Service. They were sent by Umbrella
to save Raccoon Citizens. But they don't know anything that Umbrella
does. They are grunts, as in the lower Umbrella class.

Jill runs into Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef, more UBCS.
Nicholai seems suspicious, while Mikhail is fine. Mikhail is seriously
injured, though. Jill runs to a trolley and plans for escape with them.
Jill explores a power station over by the RPD and grabs a needed fuse.

She also finds even more added power- a Grenade Launcher and a Shotgun.
When she runs into Nemesis again, the Grenade Launcher puts it down
almost instantly. The Shotgun puts zombie groups down with relative
ease. Jill finds some oil at a gas station and some cables around town
and prepares the trolley.

On her way back, she sees Nicholai shoots someone and is then attacked
by zombies. Thinking Nicholai is dead, she finds Carlos and Mikhail and
ride the trolley out of town.

The Nemesis returns. Mikhail takes a grenade and blows himself and
Nemesis out of the car. The car breaks and crashes in the clock tower.
Carlos and Jill, now with Mikhail sadly dead, try to signal a
helicopter by ringing the clock building's bell.

Jill finds the keys to them and rings them with ease. As she signals,
Nemesis uses his own Bazooka to destroy the chopper. With the help of
Carlos, Nemesis' Rocket Launcher is destroyed.

Nemesis then infects Jill with the virus. With her Magnum, Shotgun and
Grenade Launcher, Jill manages to put Nemesis down. She then blacks
out...

===============
RESIDENT EVIL 2
===============
SEPTEMBER 29, 1998

As Jill lies unconscious, Claire Redfield, the sister of Chris
Redfield, rides into town to find him. Leon Kennedy rides into town on
his first day of job. Leon and Claire run into the zombies. Leon tries
shooting them to no avail, and Claire tries running from them at a 
diner. After running from them, Claire runs into Leon.

They work together to get to a police vehicle. Claire gets a hold
of a gun. Suddenly, their police vehicle crashes thanks to a zombie.
Since the RPD Building is nearby, they decide to meet there.

(Notes: When Jill was in the RPD the day before in RE3, half the place
was blocked off. It isn't anymore by the time Claire and Leon arrive
because zombies broke through the barricades after Jill left.)

Leon and Claire take different paths to the RPD Building. Leon enters
through the front. Claire enters through the back. Leon finds a wounded
cop who helps him unlock some doors.

As Claire wanders, Umbrella drops a Tyrant into the RPD for an unknown
reason. Claire sees Tyrant, which she nicknames Mr. X. She runs away 
from the terrorizing creature.

They eventually meet in the STARS Office. Leon finds a Shotgun in the 
STARS Office and Claire finds a much needed Grenade Launcher in the main 
desk of the main lobby. Leon and Claire decide to find any survivors so 
they can have more weapons to get through the streets.

Claire runs into a young 12-year old named Sherry Birkin, the daughter
of William Birkin, who is now a monster. Leon runs into Ada Wong, a
women looking for her boyfriend, John. Claire and Sherry meet the RPD
chief, Brian Irons. He is obviously strange, and really, really
creepy. At his possession is Ms. Warren, the daughter of the mayor
of Raccoon City. Irons claims she died of zombie bite... but it
looks like a bullet hole.

Ada and Leon meet up with Ben Burtolucci. He seems to know something
about John, but isn't cooperating. Ben encourages Leon and Ada to
escape the city via the sewers. Doing just that, Ada and Leon try to
escape via the sewers. Ada climbs into an area Leon cannot reach.
She finds a key for some locked doors in the RPD. Passing them on to
Leon, she finds a way to get back to him.

Leon, impatient, decides to search the rest of the RPD on his own. He
informs Claire that the cellblock is accessable now.

Claire and Sherry reach an area under the RPD. Sherry hears her dad
supposedly scream, and runs into an area Claire cannot reach. Basically
she ends up in the area Ada explored, and only finds Acid Rounds for
Claire's grenade launcher. She decides to take a roundabout route to
get back to Claire.

Leon explores the rest of the RPD, and finds 4 chess plugs which might
work for a door near the cellblock. Using a chute from the RPD 3rd
floor, he gets back to Ben and hears him scream...

As Claire returns to explore the RPD thanks to a call from Leon, she
runs into Mr. X 3 times. Eluding the thing, she finds keys for Chief
Iron's office.

She finds Sherry at the office. Using the keys, she discovers the
chief's secret dungeon. He explains that Sherry's father, William,
invented the G-Virus. Before he can shoot her, William Birkin attacks
and cuts Irons in half. Eww... she goes down a ladder to confront
William Birkin.

Leon returns to Ben.

William Birkin, the monster, implanted Ben with a parasite. The
parasite escapes Ben's body, cutting him up. Leon contacts Sherry
and Claire to go back to the sewers for escape.

Leon sees the growing parasite. Earlier, Leon found a Magnum. It
and his Shotgun are very effective against the G-Imago. The G-Imago
dies.

Earlier, Claire found a Submachine Gun. It and her Grenade Launcher are
effective against William. William falls into a pit. After receiving
the call from Leon, Sherry and Claire find their way off the
RPD building via an underground sewer connected from Chief Iron's 
office.

Leon and Ada find the exit of the RPD to the sewer at last. As Leon and
Ada go down a lift, a woman in a lab coat shoots Leon. Leon blacks out,
but Ada chases the women through the sewer. The sniper then corners Ada
after a merry chase through the sewers.

Sherry and Claire see Mr. X continuing its unknown search. They run 
away. As they enter the sewer proper, leaving the RPD for good, Claire 
sees Sherry fall down a drain. She looks for her and runs into Leon, who
just woke up from that bullet wound in his arm. Leon tells Claire to
find Ada and Sherry. Claire moves ahead, leaving Leon to rest.

Ada and the sniper are talking. Annette Birkin is William's husband and
Sherry's mother. Annette tells how Umbrella stole the virus. Then Ada
pushes Annette over the railing and she falls into a sewer after
telling her that her boyfriend John is dead.

Wanting to rejoin Leon, Ada runs down into a pit and sees... a GIANT
ALLIGATOR! Claire runs into where Annette fell. She tells Annette that
Sherry is in the sewer. Annette faints, just after telling Claire that
Sherry has a sample of the G- Virus somewhere.

Leon wakes up. He decides to look for Ada, Claire and Sherry. He
eventually finds Ada being attacked by an alligator. He outs an 
explosive canister in its mouth, shoots it and the alligator goes 
kaboom. Ada tells Leon that John is dead. After healing his wound, Leon 
and Ada go to the tram and ride it across town.

Claire finds Sherry eventually. She asks Sherry is she has G- Virus,
like Annette had told her, but she says no. As Ada and Leon ride the
tram, William Birkin attacks them. They shrug him off, though.

Unable to find Leon and Ada, Sherry and Claire ride another tram to
follow Ada and Leon. Ada and Leon ride an elevator car down. During the
ride, Birkin wounds Ada. Leon uses his artillery to stop him.

Claire and Sherry recall the elevator car. Mr. X interupts as Claire
recalls it, but she kicks its ass. They eventually take the car down.

Birkin, who just awoke from mutation sleep, since Leon  had hurt it,
is now mutating again. Birkin is about to lose the match, but runs away.

In the lab, Leon decides to heal Ada. He looks around the lab.

Claire loses Sherry again thanks to a power loss in the elevator car.
She runs into Annette, who sees Sherry being stalked by Mr. X on a
TV screen. She tells Claire that the G-Virus is in Sherry's pendant.
Annette runs off, running into Leon.

Leon runs into Annette Birkin. Annette is about to shoot Leon, but
Birkin attacks Annette. Annette drops a G- Sample. Leon takes it
and runs into Ada, who is now threatening him.

Apparantly, Annette said Ada worked for some company out for the G-
Virus. Ada then falls down a chasm, thanks to Annette. Leon, in a rage,
throws the G- Sample over. Since the lab's explosion sequence has now
started, Leon must get out quickly.

Claire runs to where Mr. X and Sherry are. Claire takes Sherry's 
pendant, and throws it into a lava pit, with Mr. X diving in for it. 
It's the end of Mr. X...

Leon gets to the escape elevator. Birkin returns, but Leon deals with
him accordingly. Claire and Sherry reach see a hurt Anette near where
Ada fell. Annette tells Sherry to escape. Annette falls unconscious,
giving Sherry and Claire an escape key.

Claire and Sherry use an elevator to get to the train area. As Claire 
and Sherry power the train up, a hot and flaming Mr. X returns and now 
has grown a claw. Claire's weapons only slow it down. Claire knows she's
about to die... but suddenly, Ada, a dark shadow of herself, throws a 
rocket launcher to save Claire! Ada runs off...

Claire destroys Mr. X once and for all. Seeing as Ada is nowhere to be
found, Claire powers up the train and Leon comes in. The lab then
explodes in a blast, the train barely making it out. In the back of the
train, Birkin returns from his fight with Leon. Since Leon was injured
in his fight with Birkin, Claire tried to shoot Birkin with all the
ammo she has left. It only holds it at bay for a few seconds.

Birkin is still alive. The only solution is to destroy him in a
blast. The train activates the train's explosion sequence, unexpectedly.
Sherry, with Claire's help, stops the train and they all get out. Birkin
is consumed in a blast with the lab's escape train.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

Outside, Leon, Claire and Sherry recuperate. After a small argument,
Claire runs off toward Europe to find her brother Chris. Leon and Sherry 
are captured by an unknown organization...

[Meanwhile, down in the sewers between the Umbrella lab and the Police 
Station, HUNK, the man who had shot William Birkin, awakens from his 
sleep in the sewers. He seems to have gotten a sample of the G-Virus, 
and notifies his men. He is to get to the roof of the RPD to escape.]

[He runs up to the RPD, and shoots many zombies, dogs and crows. On the 
second floor RPD, it seems that a Mr. X unit is after him. Avoiding the 
terror, he makes it the hallway leading to the heliport. Another Mr. X 
seems to be attacking him. Unloading all the ammo he has left, the 
creature falls unconscious. HUNK makes it to the helicopter and is 
picked up by his men.]

[After riding away from the city, HUNK's comrades are congratulating him 
on another job well done. He is known as Mr. Death, and has survived 
once again.]

===========================
RESIDENT EVIL: GUN SURVIVOR
===========================
NOVEMBER 1998

On an isolated island in the Atlantic, a guy named Ark Thompson sneaks
into an Umbrella controlled city. He was sent by RE2's Leon to check up
on the base and its commander, Vincent. When Ark gets to the base, he
fights Vincent. Vincent, who was ready to get kicked out of Umbrella,
spilled the T- Virus into the island, called Sheena Island.

Ark Thompson loses his memory. The place has been zombified like
Raccoon City. Ark only has one gun for protection. After a phone call
from someone he questioned, Andy Holland, Ark thought he was Vincent.
Ark goes through the city, uncovering secrets about Umbrella and how
they created Tyrants. Mr. X, a Tyrant Claire ran into in Raccoon City,
chases Ark around the island.

Ark, still thinking he's Vincent, runs into Lott and Lily Klein. After
joining them in an escape, Umbrella sends in a "Cleaner" crew team to
wipe them out. Ark and the others eventually discover that many Mr. X
were being produced on the island.

Ark, Lott and Lily encounter a new type of Tyrant, similar to the one
Chris Redfield saw on the Spencer Estate. They slay it and finally
escape, before Vincent, the Cleaner crew and Andy Holland are consumed
in a blast.

One month after the Sheena Island incident and 3 months after the
Raccoon City incident, Claire Redfield goes to Europe to find Chris.
She eventually gets captured for trespassing on Umbrella's Paris Lab.
She is taken to an island near Antarctica and that's where RESIDENT
EVIL CODE: VERONICA X begins...

==============================
RESIDENT EVIL CODE: VERONICA X
==============================

Here is a detailed description of the story of CODE: Veronica. This
will explain what's behind the Ashford Family, Albert Wesker's
intentions, and the whereabouts of Steve Burnside. Unlike RE2 and RE3,
there are VERY many things leaving you out in the blue.

CODE: Veronica X first starts December 17, 1998 in Paris as Claire
gains some leads on her brother, Chris and his whereabouts. It has been
2 and a half months since Claire and her new partner Leon escaped
Raccoon City just a day before it was bombed.

Claire and Leon traveled to Paris, once again, to gain a lead on Chris
Redfield. Unable to contact his partners Jill, Barry and Rebecca,
Claire and Leon invade Umbrella's Paris Lab. Leon and Claire are
separated because the guards of the base see them.

Leon manages to escape during the attack, but Claire isn't so lucky.
Suddenly, a chopper loaded with a Gatling Gun begins to attack Claire.
(In the Beta Version, Jill's enemy from RE3 (Nicholai) is piloting the
chopper.) The guards are still chasing her. She ducks into a hallway.
The guns kill the guards chasing her.

Claire runs down the hallway, barely missing the choppers' guns. She
ends up on the base's rooftop. She uses a slick move to wipeout the
guards. Suddenly, a Hispanic man captures her at gunpoint. Claire is
captured.

10 Days later, she is taken to an isolated Umbrella Base, called
Rockfort Island. After being told her identity number, she is butted in
the head by a rifle butt. Time passes and Claire wakes up to a huge
explosion. Up above her seemingly underground cellblock, she hears guns
roaring and people screaming. Moments later silence hits.

The door to the cellblock opens. A heavily breathing man comes in.
Somehow the guards managed to not see Claire's lighter. She lights the
lighter and she sees the man who captured Claire at Paris. The man
frees Claire and sits down because he was wounded in the chaos above.

Claire discovers he needs Hemostat. Looking at the list, Claire finds
out his name is Rodrigo Juan Raval. Grabbing a nearby Combat Knife,
Claire leaves the cellblock. She eventually climbs a flight of stairs
to a graveyard.

As she passes through, a burning truck explodes. A burning man goes
toward Claire. It's A ZOMBIE! It seems the attack caused a viral leak
in the area. Claire was luckily to avoid the zombies.

Claire arrives in the main hall of the prison complex. She is then
attacked by a Gatling Gun. Claire sees a pistol and dispatches the gun.
Apparently, Steve Burnside, a prisoner, sees Claire and thanks her for
not being a zombie. After rudely introducing himself, Steve runs off
for the island's rumored airport.

Claire looks around the prison, which is now a zombie's hell house. As
she explores the prohibited areas, Claire catches up to Steve, who is
looking up on Chris Redfield on a computer. Steve asks Claire to
contact Chris to come save them. Claire does that, though Steve wasn't
serious about the idea. Claire can't contact Chris directly, but she
figures Leon can. She e-mails Leon to get Chris to help them. She gives
Leon the coordinates of the island and Chris himself. Steve runs off
angrily.

[Chris Redfield, somewhere in the world, receives an e-mail from Leon, 
and discovers that Claire Redfield was caught by Umbrella...]

After finding the right keys, Claire escapes through prison's main
gate, near where she met Steve. After finding her way up a cliff,
Claire sees a military training complex. She explores the area, but
shutters block off most of the complex.

She manages to find a Bow Gun, though. And she also sees a man get
slaughtered by a yellow zombie in a locked lab. Claire sees a picture
she think may be important later on.

Claire decides to find the key cards elsewhere on the island. Leaving
the military complex for now, she sees a big palace up ahead.

She enters the palace and looks around for the key cards. She finds a
few locked doors. One of them is different. It needs to be unlocked
using 2 special pistols. Claire looks on the first floor and after
unlocking a strange movie, she fins the 2 guns she needs. The movie was
shot, showing 2 twins, a boy and a girl, feeding a wingless dragonfly
to a hill of ants.

Claire grabs the pistols, but then the room locks her in and the room
heats up. She inserts them back in. She decides to exit the palace to
look for the military complex's keys elsewhere. But as she exits, she
hears Steve's scream. She runs back to the Luger trap to see Steve
caught in it.

Using the reflexes she learned in Raccoon City, she saves Steve. Steve
has the Lugers Claire needs for the door. He offers to trade for 2
fully automatic weapons. But Claire's 3 pistols and her bow gun don't
satisfy Steve.

As Claire gears up to leave, she sees Alfred Ashford, the owner of the
island. Alfred tells Claire she attacked the island. Alfred continues
to shoot and miss at Claire with his sniper rifle.

Alfred also says his grandfather founded Umbrella originally. Alfred
leaves with a death threat to Claire. Seemingly not intimidated, Claire
continues her mission to find the military complex's card keys.

Claire sees a submarine beside the palace. She works the controls and
sees it going down. It stops. She gets out to see she's at an
underwater military airport.

She looks around and finds an airplane she can use to get out. She
needs 3 special keys to activate the plane, though. She looks around to
find another locked shutter. Looking at some maps, she sees a giant
elevator behind the shutter and remembering the maps of the military
complex, she thinks the broken elevator in the military facility's yard
leads down the airport.

To her surprise, Claire finds a key card she needs for the military
complex. Taking the submarine back to the palace, Claire continues for
the military complex. As she passes by the palace gates, she notices a
smaller private mansion on top of a hill behind the palace.

Continuing for the military complex, Claire eventually arrives. In the
yard, she sees a giant worm attack her. Like the dead alligator she saw
in the sewers of Raccoon City, this thing is huge, but not too smart.
Claire escapes the thing by ducking into the facility.

She gets through the locked shutters. In a room, Claire is ambushed by
Alfred, but thanks to his bad aim, Claire chases Alfred further into
the complex. In a medical room, Claire finds the hemostat she needs for
Rodrigo.

Claire gears for the prison, but she then discovers that Alfred lowered
a shutter that leads to the exit. Claire goes further. That yellow
zombie that killed the scientist then attacks her. It is a cross
between a zombie and tyrant. Using her twin pistols, she shrugs them
off.

Continuing, the another yellow zombie attacks her. But Steve them saves
her with the Lugers. Claire trades Steve the Lugers for the Submachine
Guns she found a few moments ago.

Alfred suddenly lowers them into the complex's basement. Steve runs
ahead of Claire and destroys a fresh set of zombies for her. Claire
catches up to Steve. Questioning him about his family, Steve runs off.

She catches up to Steve in an unstable balcony. They fall through.
Suddenly, a zombie rises and then runs toward Claire. Steve hesitates
to shoot it. When it is about to eat Claire, Steve unloads the rest of
his bullets into the creature, while yelling, "father!!!" After the
zombie dies, Steve starts crying.

He tells Claire that his father took Umbrella info and sold it. Steve
and his family were caught, his mom was killed and Steve hates his dad
for doing this to him. Claire leaves Steve to mourn his dad's death.
Apparently, Steve just shot his zombie dad.

Claire finds Alfred's crest in a room with the facility's diorama. She
uses it on a little box she found earlier. She finds the last key card
needed to explore the facility. She finds a key for the airport's
plane.

Claire also finds her way into the lab where the yellow zombie killed
that scientist. Claire sees the painting she wanted. Noticing a
resemblance to a painting she saw in the facility's diorama room, she
hooks it on to the wall where the eagle plate was. As she leaves,
albinoid experiments escape the lab and run up vents. Claire escapes
before the lab is locked.

A wall in the diorama room is raised, revealing the actual diorama the
wall was hiding. She sees a key, gold colored. Claire sees that this
can open a door at the palace.

Claire races for the palace. She opens the door she wants to open and
sees a room full of paintings of Alfred's ancestors. After looking
around, Claire finds a strange queen ant model.

Claire travels to the door with the luger engravings. Using the lugers,
Claire unlocks the door to an office. There, she discovers that Alfred
has a twin sister, Alexia, and according to Alfred's butler, he's seen
her in Alfred's private house.

Claire finds her way to a bridge. Up ahead, Claire sees the private
house on the hill she's been wanting to explore for more clues. She
explores the house and nearly runs into Alexia Ashford. She's talking
to her brother about Claire and Steve's destruction. They then leave.

The house has been damaged by the island's attack, but Claire finds a
key she needs for the palace's remaining doors. Heading back to the
palace, Claire finds another eagle plate. She then remembers a door she
saw in the prison complex that had an eagle engraving.

After looking in a slot room, Claire decides to head back to the
prison. There, she goes to the cellblock and sees a dying Rodrigo.
Fortunately, Claire saves him in time with hemostat. After thanking
each other, Claire trades her lighter for Rodrigo's lockpick.

Claire explores the door behind the one with the eagle plate. Claire
discovers an infirmary. After confronting a powerful zombie, Claire
unlocks the path to a secret basement.

There, she finds a piano roll that fits perfectly into the piano at the
palace. Claire gears for the palace. In the yard, someone familiar
attacks her: Albert Wesker. Wesker tells Claire he attacked the island
and is after Chris now. As Claire is attacked, she notices a key she
needs for the airport. Wesker tells Claire he'll use her to get to
Chris.

Wesker, after getting a call from his men, jumps over a wall, toward
the palace's dock. Collecting the airport key, Claire heads into the
palace's piano. Claire finds a king ant model, like the queen model she
found earlier.

Heading back to the private residence, Claire discovers the ant models
where keys to a secret lair above Alfred and Alexia's bedrooms. Claire
discovers the final airport key and decides to find Steve and Rodrigo
and leave.

Alexia Ashford attacks Claire on her way out. She has a sniper rifle
like Alfred's. Suddenly, Steve comes in and shoots Alexia through a
door. The door is easy passage between Alexia and Alfred's bedrooms.

Claire sees Alfred with make up on. Apparently, he's been dressing like
his sister. Claire decides that Alexia is just Alfred's imagination.
Alfred runs off crying. He sets off the self-destruct sequence.

Claire and Steve run to the palace gates, near where Claire was
attacked by Wesker. Steve leads Claire to the airport. Claire inserts
the keys to the plane. Unfortunately, the drawbridge is in the way of
the plane. Claire volunteers to raise it.

Claire runs to the controls and raises them. In a room she couldn't
access before, Claire finds the keys to the shutter blocking the
elevator.

Claire decides to ride the elevator up to the military complex and head
back to the plane via the palace's submarine. She does just that. After
fixing the elevator, the 5 minute timer for the explosion begins. As
Claire rides the elevator up, Alfred releases a monster after Claire...
Can it be? Yeah it's...

Claire steps out of the elevator and as she expected, she ends up in
the military complex's yard. Dodging the giant worm, she gears for the
palace.

On her way, a fire traps Claire. Tyrant comes from the fence.
Apparently, it's the monster Alfred released. Claire uses her bazooka
she found earlier and manages to put Tyrant down. Claire dashes passed
the palace and down the submarine into the airport.

Steve manages to pilot the plane and then the plane lifts off from an
exploding island. As the plane circles the island, the prison, palace
and private mansion are consumed in the blast, but the military complex
seems to withstand it.

Not caring, Claire and Steve fly off. They apologize for everything
mean they said to each other. Suddenly, the plane rocks. In the back,
Claire sees Tyrant. Claire uses her bazooka to weaken it and then
catapults it off the plane. It looks like her encounter with Mr. X on
Raccoon City did her some good.

Back on the exploding island, Alfred runs into the somehow surviving
military complex. He sees the tank and moves it to reveal a secret
lift. The lift leads to a different area of the airport. Alfred hitches
a ride on one of the 2 harrier jets and flies away from the island.

On Claire's plane, Alfred controls the plane and changes it's
direction. Steve can't change it so they have no choice. Hours later
Steve attempts to kiss a sleeping Claire, but fails. Moments later, the
plane crashes into an Umbrella Base in Antarctica.

Claire and Steve get off the broken plane and look around separately.
Claire finds the diary revealing that a monster named Nosferatu is
trapped somewhere in the base. Also, it seems Alfred Ashford spilled
the T- Virus around the base, so there are now zombies in the area.
Looking in a private office, Claire finds the evil monster trapped in a
chair beneath wire mesh. What has Alfred been up to?

Claire looks around and asks Steve to lift a digging car with a crane.
Steve looks at Claire and causes a gas leak in the room. Claire fixes
it. Suddenly, Alfred, still wearing make up and talking like Alexia,
tries to shoot Claire, but Steve comes in and shoots Alfred down a deep
chasm.

Nosferatu suddenly feels agitated. He breaks free of his prison and
runs off... Claire grabs Alfred's sniper rifle and Steve and Claire dig
out of the room with the digging car. They eventually get to a heliport
above the base.

Nosferatu suddenly attacks Steve. Steve is KO'ed, while Claire must
fight him on his own. Using the sniper rifle, Claire punctures
Nosferatu's once human heart and kills him. Claire rescues Steve.

They find a car and drive off to an Australian Base. Meanwhile, Alfred,
nearly dead, releases his sister from cryogenic sleep. Alfred tells
Alexia to kill Claire. Alfred then dies of blood loss.

Alexia uses her mind to attack Claire and Steve's car. The car burns.
Did Claire and Steve survive?

Meanwhile, on Rockfort Island, Chris Redfield arrives. Leon managed to
contact him. Chris climbs a cliff and arrives in a cave. There, he sees
Rodrigo. After Rodrigo tells Chris he saw Claire and Steve leave the
island, that worm Claire saw swallows up Rodrigo.

Chris chases the worm throughout the cave. Finding some Submachine
Guns, Chris kills the thing. Rodrigo is swallowed up, but dies shortly
after, giving Chris the lighter before he dies. Chris finds his way
into a lightly damaged military complex.

Chris looks around and finds his way to Alfred's harrier jet bay. He
needs a halberd that was on the eagle plates Claire found to open the
harrier doors.

Chris finds his way to the control room. He sees Alexia Ashford singing
on the wide screen. Down in the airport where Claire boarded the plane
with Steve, Wesker is happy that Chris is finally here. He sends
Hunters after Chris.

Chris finds the eagle plate Claire used to open the box. But
unfortunately, it falls down into the sewers below thanks to a giant
hole caused by the explosion. He finds his way into the lab area thanks
to a hole in the wall.

Chris sees a knob-less door Claire didn't explore. Chris decides to
find a doorknob in the basement. There, he explores a lab where the T-
Virus was leaked from.

He finds a chemical he thinks he needs for getting the halberd. It's 
called Clement E. It, mixed with Clement A, can melt the alloy part of
Alfred's eagle plate.

Chris finds his doorknob and then is scanned by a scanner. Moments
later, the Hunters Wesker sent attack Chris. Chris, using a shotgun he 
found, kills them. Chris sees the scanners when he gets back to the 
knob-less door.

Avoiding them, Chris ends up on the other side of the broken balcony
that Steve and Claire fell through right before Steve assassinated his 
father. Finding a small tank object resembling the tank outside the 
facility, Chris inserts it to the little hole in the diorama on the 
first floor. The paintings in the room slide to reveal 3 little keys 
needed and a turntable key.

There's also a note from Alfred saying there's a passage beneath the
diorama that takes Alfred from the military complex to his private
residence. Chris notices the 3 key holes and notes them.

On his way, Chris sees Albert Wesker. Wesker attacks Claire and says
Claire won't live long and that she's in the Antarctic with Steve and
the evil Alexia. Suddenly, Alexia Ashford appears on a screen and
Laughs, as if she is expecting something to happen. Wesker seems to have 
super powers, as he has yellow eyes... Wesker vanishes and a yellow 
zombie attacks Chris. Using his submachine guns, he kills it.

After finding his way to the main yard thanks to the turntable key,
Chris sees that he can't get to the palace thanks to rubble blocking the 
entrance to the passage.

Alternately, taking the elevator down to the airport, Chris sees the 
keys Claire used to board the plane. They also fit into the 3 key holes 
in Alfred's diorama room. Grabbing them, Chris tries to use a submarine 
he saw on a map to get to the palace.

Unfortunately, the submarine somehow got docked up at the palace, so
access to the palace is impossible. Taking the 3 keys back to the
diorama in the military complex, Chris manages to find the ladder.

Following a tunnel, Chris discovers that the door leading to the
private residence is locked. But nearby, Chris sees Alfred's private
swimming pool. In it is the eagle plate. There's also a monster on the
pool.

It's the albinoid Claire released from the lab. It matured really fast.
Chris uses his shotgun to dispose of the electric monster. Chris grabs
the eagle plate. But Clement E alone can't dissolve the alloy.

Chris backtracks to the basement area, where Steve had a shooting spree. 
The explosion caused a gas problem, but a lever fixes the problem. He 
finds the final Clement A and then mixes it with Clement E. The mixture 
solution causes the eagle plate to dissolve, leaving the halberd.

Using the halberd, Chris gains access to the harrier bay. He jumps on
the last plane and flies to Antarctica.

After he leaves Rockfort, he travels across the blue ocean. When he 
reaches the base, a docking bay at the base welcomes him. It seems as 
though Alexia has been expecting Chris.

There, Chris immediately looks for Claire. It seems that the place was
filled with ice from when Claire and Steve tried to escape. This helps
Chris access new areas.

In an area that looks like the Spencer Estate, Chris finally finds
Claire. After saving her, Claire and Chris decide to find Steve. Alexia
comes and curses at them, and threatens them. Claire and Chris give 
chase toward Alexia, but a giant tentacle separates them.

Claire wakes to see Chris' foot and knees injured. Chris tells Claire
to find Steve. Suddenly, they hear Steve scream. Obeying Chris' request, 
Claire chases Alexia through a few doors.

Using her guns, she kills a few of Alexia's tentacles. Claire finally
sees Steve in a prison, after nearly risking her life to find the 
appropriate keycard to enter. It's the room Nosferatu was stuck in. 
Steve tells Claire that Alexia performed the same experiment that she
performed on her own father.

Steve suddenly grows and mutates into a giant toad-like monster, unlike 
Nosferatu. It then begins to attack Claire with a giant ax. Claire runs 
off to the exit and makes it just as the gate lowers. But since the door 
was locked by Alexia, Steve begins to attack Claire.

Suddenly, a tentacle grabs and constricts Claire. Steve is about to
kill Claire, but his human personality comes back and Steve cut the
tentacle. The tentacle whacks Steve at about 50 miles an hour and Steve
is flung into the wall.

Steve tells Claire he loves her and that he can't keep his promise of
leaving with her. Slowly, Steve dies due to a violent strike, as if he 
were hit by a truck. Claire cries and cradles over the body of Steve 
Burnside, crying.

During the death of Steve, Wesker calls Alexia to come with him because
she has her experiment, T- Veronica Virus, in her. Somehow, Alexia 
managed to elude Claire and returned to the main hall Alexia walks down 
the grand stairs of the Spencer estate-esque place, and then begins
to burn. Her clothing begins to shrivel. Alexia's choker falls to the
Floor at her feet, Chris taking notice over in the corner.

Alexia is now a gray evil mad woman. She looks like a cross between a
dragonfly and ant. Wesker attempts to capture her. Alexia raised her 
gray hand and Wesker gets punched across the room. He moves across, 
tells Alexia he's coming with her and then punches Alexia via a long 
spring from the walls. After punching Alexia, Wesker notices Chris. And 
he is armed with a weapon. Realizing that Wesker can't defeat Alexia, 
Wesker sees Chris take care of Alexia.

Chris uses his shotgun to kill Alexia. He keeps moving and eventually
10 shotgun shells put Alexia down  at Chris' feet. Chris, judging from a 
file he found earlier, thinks Alexia's choker can access a door behind 
the painting above the staircase of the mansion main hall replica. At 
Chris' feet is the choker. He uses it on the painting.

Chris looks at the file some more and sees that Alexander Ashford was
turned into a monster thanks to Alfred and Alexia. Chris leaves the
main hall and then heads down an elevator. As Chris exited the mansion,
Alexia rises to her feet from her slumber. She's still alive. Chris is 
now in a room with a giant anthill.

Searching around, Chris finds the room Alexia was stored in for 15 years 
during her coping of the T-Veronica Virus. He plays with the controls 
and then out of the tube falls Alfred Ashford's dead body. At Chris' 
feet is Alfred's Ring. Chris grabs Alfred's ring. Looking around the 
base a second time, Chris learns that Nosferatu was implanted in the ice 
thanks to Alexia.

In the file, Alfred said Alexander Ashford was turned into a monster.
Thinking the dead Nosferatu will have the 3rd jewel to open up the
Painting, he decides to look in the ice.

At Chris' feet below the ice is Nosferatu's body.

Using a crane to get Nosferatu's body, Chris grabs the 3rd jewel, after 
an argument with a gigantic spider similar to the one Jill saw beneath 
the real Spencer Estate. 

Chris opens up the painting in the Spencer Estate imitation hall and 
finds a lab just passed it. It's where Alexander Ashford tested the T- 
Veronica Virus. It also reveals Alfred and Alexia where created through 
inserting a sperm cell into an embryo that belonged to Veronica, their 
ancestor.

Nearby are replicas of the bedroom from Rockfort Island's Private 
Residence. There, Chris finds a key detrimental to unlocking a room 
where he can blow the base up. That is all he finds, however. He returns 
to the lab, and goes through a door he hasn't gone through yet.

The lab leads to where Steve died. Unfortunately, there's a locked door
between Chris and Claire. Claire tells Chris that Steve is dead and
tells him to set the explosion sequence like in the real Spencer Estate, 
Raccoon City and Rockfort Island. Chris does just that.

Chris runs for the door leading to the computer which can set off the 
base's exploding sequence. Using the key he found above Alfred and 
Alexia's imitation bedrooms passed the lab, he unlocks the room and 
finds the appropriate computer, after killing off 2 zombies. 

After inserting the CODE: Veronica thanks to the file, Claire and Chris
rejoin each other. Suddenly, a tentacle separates them once again. 
Alexia has returned.

Chris and Claire see a good weapon to use nearby, called the Linear 
Launcher. Claire and Chris turn the keys simultaneously, but now it has 
to charge. Chris decides to keep Alexia busy as Claire decides to run 
off.

After nearly destroying Claire, Chris shoots Alexia with a bullet and 
causes her to mutate into a large monster. Claire attempts to run for 
the elevator. Chris fires every weapon he has against the giant Alexia.

He uses the Shotgun, his Handgun, the Submachine Guns and the Grenade 
Launcher against the mammoth beast that was Alexia. Dodging a bunch of 
tentacles and little parasites attacking him, his abuse to Alexia pays 
off.

Suddenly, the ants beneath in the hill start to attack Alexia.

Alexia shrugs them off by growing wings and is now flying. The bulk of 
her body dissolves just after Alexia leaves it. Apparently the bulk of 
the giant Alexia was a feeder for Alexia to grow wings. 

Coincidentally, the Linear Launcher has finished charging. Chris grabs 
it and shoots a ray into the base, with the plasma slamming into the 
walls of the base. The thing is heavy, and with Alexia spewing fire like 
her first form, it is hard for him to get a clear hit. 

But Chris gets lucky, and shoots a ray into Alexia's chest. Alexia 
screams and then the next second, she is liquefied by the impending 
blast, and is finally dead.

Chris drops the Linear Launcher and  starts to run as explosions begin 
to occur. As Chris gets down to the prison cells and to the elevator, he 
sees Wesker holding Claire by the neck. Nearby, the door leading to 
where Steve died is open...

Wesker pushes Claire through a hole in the wall. Chris chases Wesker
through a horde of zombies and catches up to them, in a submarine dock, 
which seems to be far enough from the base's explosion. Chris and Claire
discover Wesker took Steve Burnside to get the T- Alexia Virus.

Chris and Wesker decide to kill each other once and for all, and Claire 
returns to the plane. At the plane, Claire looks into the elevator to 
wait for Chris...

Chris and Wesker battle. Chris tries using a pipe to hurt Wesker, but 
Wesker basically kicks Chris' ass. Wesker's superpowers are simply 
unbeatable for Chris. Explosions are still rocking the base. 

Chris sees a ton of iron bars supported by a rope. Chris trips the rope, 
causing the bars to land on Wesker.

Too bad they were ineffective.

Wesker rises to his feet, and stumbles a little, and gets ready to kill 
Chris for that stunt. 

Suddenly, an explosion rocks the entire room. 

Wesker and Chris are separated in a blast of fire. They vow to kill each 
other next time. Wesker laughs his ass off, as Chris runs back to the 
plane.  

Passing back through the zombie hall, the place is now on fire, and is 
ready to collapse. Chris calls the elevator and ducks his head to avoid 
the explosions and debris flying all over the prison cell walls. 
Luckily, they are made out of solid stone, and hold up for the time 
being. 

The elevator arrives, and Chris rides down. Amazingly, the glass around 
the elevator holds up as explosions rock it. Then the glass breaks all 
over Chris, but luckily the elevator door opens, and the final explosion 
blows him out of the elevator onto the plane, landing on his stomach. 
Ignoring it, he gets on the plane.

Piloting the plane, he escapes the blasts and flies out of the base.

Claire is happy to see Chris once again. 

They apologize for leaving each other and then decide to take out
Umbrella once and for all.

In the distance, the Umbrella Ashford Antarctica Base completes its 
detonation sequence, and the entire building explodes and collapses as 
they fly away.

Well, that is CVX's story. I personally think the Plot Guide has a
better synopsis. Check it out!
