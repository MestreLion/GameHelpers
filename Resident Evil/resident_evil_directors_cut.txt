    Over the past month I was board and decided to copy all the files from Resident
 Evil:Directors Cut,The files are thoughs papers you find laying around the game that 
 explain what happened in the mansion.I also had the time to start a RESIDENT EVIL 
 web site(details at the bottom).So print these out and enjoy,so you won't have to 
 waist time while reading them from the game.

FEEDBACK
  Well I must have got a million emails on this FAQ which is to say quite unexpected.
Half those million questions asked where the helmet key was.?!?!?Did they not read this FAQ.
Its in this FAQ so read this time.I also got a ton of emails about me saying the game is called
advanced and there's is called Arrange.?!?My copy says advanced so I stick by that!Yes arrange 
and advance are the same game.I also received a few emails on the picture puzzle.Thanx for 
telling me guys,I fixed the prob.Oh wait there was no prob.If you don't follow this walkthru
directly expect the game to be a little different.If I feel your questions are answered in
the FAq I WILL NOT RPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE!So if your having trouble check out my web page.

THE ENEMIES
  One of the greatest strategies is to know the enemy.
**the zombie**The slowest and easiest of all enemies in the game.These enemies are easier to
dodge rather than fight.
**dogs**Fast and deadly they should be taken out quick before they take out you.
**hunters**even more deadly then the dogs.The hunters is an enemy I hate to encounter.I usually
just dodge them.But its best to kill them using the colt python or acid rounds.
**chimeras**They hang out in the power room deep in the lab.They walk on the ceiling and swoop
down at an enemy.Just fire a shot up to knock them down.Then aim down and kill em.
**crows**Do not bother to kill them,just run.You'll save plenty of ammo.
**snakes**Don't bother to kill them either.
**bees**same here just run.
**Super zombies**They are only found in the lab,their super strong and super naked.It only
takes about 3 attacks for them to kill you so beware.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
3)
THE WEAPONS
  Every enemy has a weak spot.Even the bully down the street.
**The Beretta**You start with this.Its best at taking out dogs and zombies earlier in the game.
if you like to save ammo use this alot.
**The Shotgun**The best for killing zombies.Wait until the zombies are in close range and blow 
there heads off.
**The Combat Knife**The weakest weapon in the entire game.I don't even bother to use it.Its only
good when you have no ammo.
**The bazooka**Only Jill will get this.It has 3 different kinds of ammo.Acid,Explosive,and Flame
each good for taking out certain enemies.
**The Colt Python**The strongest weapon in the game(except for the rocket launcher)Its specialty
is killin Hunters in 1 or 2 shots.
**The Rocket Launcher**It claims to kill any enemy in one shot.I'll tell you now that thats a
total lie.It takes plenty of shots to kill the snake with it.And plenty of shots to kill all
the other bosses.Except for Tyrant this is the only boss it kills in one shot.But don't get
me wrong its still the strongest weapon.

 BOTANY BOOK
      ~About Medical Herbs~
   As you know,there are many plants that have medical effects.
   Since ancient times,humans have been healing wounds and 
   diseases using various plants.
   In this book,we're going to sample three herbs that grow 
   around the Raccoon Mountains and give their outlines as
   examples of those plants and medical properties.
   Each herb has different colors and different effects as
   medical plants:the green one recovers physical strength,
   the blue one neutralizes natural toxins,while the red 
   herb does not have any effect by itself.The red herb
   is only effective when it is mixed with other herbs.
   For example,if you mix this herb with the herb that 
   recovers physical strength,the recovery effect will be
   tripled.By adjusting the amount and experimenting wuth
   these three herbs,you can create various kinds of 
   medicines but I'll leave the details in your hands,because
   that's the best way to acquire true knowledge.

 KEEPER'S DIARY
 May 9,1998
   At night,we played poker with Scott the guard,Alias and Steve
 the researcher.Steve was really lucky,but I think he was 
 cheating.What a scumbag.
 May 10,1998
   Today,a high ranking researcher asked me to take care of a new
 monster.It looks like a gorilla without any skin.They told me
 to feed them live food.When I threw in a pig,they were playing with
 it.....tearing off the pig's legs and pulling out the guts before
 they actually ate it.
 May 11,1998
   Around 5 o'clock this morning,Scott came in and woke me up suddenly.
 He was wearing a protection suit that looks like a space suit.
 He told me to put one on has well.I heard there was an accident in
 the basement Lab.It's no wonder,those researchers never rest,
 even at night.
 May 12,1998
   I've been wearing this annoying space suit since yesterday,my skin
 grows musty and feels very itchy.By way of revenge,I didn't feed
 those dogs today.Now I feel better.
 May 13,1998
   I went to the medical room because my back is all swollen and feels
 itchy.They put a big bandage on my back and the doctor told me I
 did not need to wear the space suit anymore.I guess I can sleep well tonight.
 May 14,1998
   when I woke up this morning,I found another blister on my foot.It was 
 annoyong and I ended up dragging my foot as I went to the dog's pen.
 I found that some of them had escaped.I'll be in real trouble if the 
 higher-ups find out.
 May 15,1998
   Even though I didn't feel well,I decided to go to see Nancy.It's my first
 day off in a long time,but I was stopped by the guard on the way out.
 They say the company has ordered that no one leave the grounds.I can't even
 make a phone call.What kind of a joke is this?
 May 16,1998
   I heard a researcher who tried to escape from this mansion was shot last
 night.My entire body feels burning and itchy at night.When I was scratching 
 the swelling on my arm,a lump of rotten flesh dropped off.What the hell is 
 happening to me?
 May 19,1998
   Fever gone but itchy.Hungry and ate doggie food.Itchy itchy Scott
  came.Ugly face so killed him.Tasty
    4
  Itchy.
  Tasty.

RESEARCHER'S WILL
 My dear Alma,
   The fact that you have received this letter is both a joy and a sadness for me.
 I could not even talk to you because of that guy in the sunglasses.Alma be
 calm and read this......
   I think I've told you that I moved to a pharmaceutial company's lab.They 
 head hunted me.Last month,there was an accident in the lab abd the virus we 
 were studying escaped.
   All my colleages who were infected by the virus are dead.To be accurate,
 they've become the living dead.They still wonder around.Some of them are
 knocking on my room door desperately right now.But there's no sign of intelligence 
 in their eyes.
   That cursed virus takes away all humanity from the human brain.Love,joy
 sorrow,fear,humor....eternally.
   And Alma,even the memories of the days I spent with you....
   Yes,I'm infected.I did everything I could,but I could only delay the progress
 by a few days.The most frightning thing is,that I forget more about you by the day.
   So I chose a peaceful death,rather than becoming the living dead.
   Within an hour,I will have entered my eternal sleep.I do hope you'll 
 understand my decision.....
                   Goodbye and Forever yours,     
                                 Martin Crackhorn

ORDERS
 TOP SECRET july 22,1998 2:13
   To the head of the Security Department

  "X-day" is approaching.Complete the following orders within a week.
 1.Lure the members of S.T.A.R.S. into the lab and have them fight with
   the B.O.W. in order to obtain data of actual battles. 
 2.Collect two embryos per B.O.W. type making sure to include all species
   except for Tyrant.
 3.Destroy the Arklay Lab inculding all researchers and lab animals in 
   a matter which will seem accidental.

PLANT 42 REPORT
  4 days have passed since the accident and the plant a point 42 is
 grower amazingly fast.
  It has been effected by the T-Virus differently than other plants have 
 been and shows unique shape in addition to its size.Looking at
 the way it behaves,it is now difficult to determine what kind of plant
 it was originally.
  There are two ways in which Plant 42 gathers nutrition.The first one is through
 its root that reaches into the basement.Immediately after the accident,a 
 scientist wnet mad and broke the water tank in the basement.Now the basement
 is filled with water.
  It is easily imaginable that some chemical elements were blended in the water
 and promotes the incredibly fast growth of Plant 42.
  Another part of plant 42 from the basement grow through the duct and hangs
 down like so many bulbs from the ceiling of the first floor.Many vines
 come out of those bulbs and they are the second resource for its nutrition.
  Once the plant senses movement,plant 42 shoots its vines around the prey
 and holds it.Then it starts sucking up blood,using the suckers located at the
 back of its vine.
  It also has some intelligence.It blocks the door by twining its vines around
 it especially when it captures prey or its sleeping.Several staff members
 have already fallen victims to this.

FAX
 TO:Manager of Sanitation Division
 FROM:Special Committee on Disasters Raccoon Special Research Dept.
 
 This memrandum is strictly confidential and must be destroyed as soon as it is
understood.Regarding the "T-Virus" outbreak which occured recently,this Committee
conducted a field survey.According to the survey results,estimates on the amount
of damage caused by the accident are considerably greater than reported earlier.
 First,although it is very diificult to obtain accurate data in terms of actual
numbers,it is though that more than half of the researchers died after exposure
to the "T-Virus".The body count will most likely increase since nearly all the
survivors show symptons peculiar,to the "T-Virus".
 Second,our security system is still in operation.However,our special security
guard squad has been nearly destroyed.Because of that,research information 
considered by our company to be top secret has been made available to outsiders.
Counter-measures should be taken as soon as possible.
 Finally many of the "subjects"from theexperiment have escaped and are out of
control.We beleive that some researchers were killed by these "subjects" and 
there bodies were mutilated.
 By curious coincidence,these events are proof of the success of our research.
However,there is also a very high risk that this news may be leaked to the
press if we don't act immediately.The condition is very serious.Our operation
to cover up the situation is difficult to obtain,however we hope the problem
will be solved quickly.We are especially concerned that the State Police
and S.T.A.R.S. are intervening to quickly.We need to act on this situation
as well.

SCRAP BOOK
   Raccoon Times May 17 1998
     Animal Attack?Woman Mutilated
 May 20.Around 10p.m. a 20-year old young woman's body was found by a passer-by on 
the left bank of Marble River in the Cider District of Raccoon City.Raccoon
police assume it to be a grizzly or other animal's doing because there
are teeth marks along her mutilated arms and left foot the show considerable power.
Since she was wearing a hiking boot on her remaining foor,it has been determined
that she was attacked in the Arklay Mountains and fell into the river.They
are hurrying to identify this woman.
   Raccoon Weekly June 16 1998
     Monsters in Arklay Mountains?
 Some people claim they've seen monsters in the Arklay Mountains.The monsters are 
supposedly about the same size as large dogs and usually run in a pack as wolves
do.This may sound like a group of ordinary wild dogs,but these monsters are 
surprisingly fierce and hard to hurt.They say these dogs won't bother you unless
you wake them,so you smart readers should stay out of the Arklay Mountains for the
time being.But if you're looking for adventure,check it out!You wanna try?
   Raccoon Times July 9 1998
     Mystery on Arklay Mountains?Mountain road blocked.
 Due to successive disasters in the Arklay Mountains,the city authorities have decided
to block the road leading to the foothills.At the same time,Raccoon police intend to
begin the search for lost people with the help of S.T.A.R.S.team members.They expect
great difficulty because of the vast size of Arklay Mountains and the primeval forest
that covers most of the area.Also people are still reporting sightings of grotesque
monsters in the mountains.

Researcher's Letter
 June 8,1998

  Dear Ada,
    Ada,by the time you read this,I'll be something....different.Today's test 
   turned out to be positive,just as I expected.I fell like going crazy when
   I think about becoming one of them.Ada,you're not infected and I hope you 
   never will be.In case you're the last one left,take the material in the 
   Visual Data Room and go to the Power Room to operate the Triggering System
   before you escape.And make all this public through the media.If everything
   is in order,all the locks can be opened by the security system.You can access
   the system if you log in with my name from the terminal in the small lab and
   enter  the password.The password is your name.To unlock the door at B2 where
   the Visual Data Room is located,you'll need to access with our names first and
   then enter another password.I've written the code below.I'm sure you'll 
   understand it easily.And this ismy last hope-if you find me completely
   changed,please kill me yourself.
  
   Password=MOLE
                 yours,John

"V-Jolt Report"

   As I stated in the last report,there are some common features found in the
 cells of the plant infected by the Tyrant virus.We also have found another
 interesting fact through some experiments.
   We found an element that destroys these plant cells rapidly in "UMB no.16"
 one of the series of UMB chemicals that we used for that experiment.We named
 the "UMB no.16" as "V-JOLT".
   In our calculation,it will take less then 5 seconds to destroy Plant42 if
 we put the "V-Jolt" directly on the root.You need to mix some of the UMB series
 chemicals in a specific order to create "V-Jolt".But the UMB series chemical
 may generate a poisonous gas which is harmful to the human body.Extreme caution
 should be taken when handling the chemicals.
   Following are the types of UMB series chemicals and their brief characteristics.
 
 UMB NO.2 RED       NP-003 PURPLE
 UMB NO.4 GREEN     YELLOW-6 YELLOW
 UMB NO.7 WHITE  
 UMB NO.13 BLUE(stimulating smell)
 V-JOLT(UMB NO.16) BROWN
