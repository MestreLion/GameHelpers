***********************************************************************
  Resident Evil Director's Cut is my first Resident Evil I have played.
At the first time, I thought it was only an ordinary game that was
confusing and crazy. But when I played it, I was fascinated by the
thrilling episodes and weird puzzles. It was also the first time I knew
what an adventure game is. And I have continued the next Resident Evil:
Resident Evil 2, 3, Survivor and Code Veronica. The reason why I make
this guide is to spend my spare time and also to introduce for anyone
who want to know about this game. This guide can be used to play the 
popular version of Resident Evil. (Non- Director's Cut or Dual Shock 
Edition) I have added some passages about its former versions for you to 
know more about this great game. About walkthrough, I don't write 
specific avoiding it'll spoil your game. So don't blame me about this. 
But you can have ideas about my mistakes or new menu. I thank you and 
all your ideas. Enjoy the guide !

 FAQs started...
 This is always my first step. 

 - Version 2.0 (July 8th, 2001)
 Added Health Guide

this kind of games. Hope them useful for you ! 

 - Version 2.5 (July 9th, 2001)
 Added "Monster list"
 Repair mistakes

  Added "Other Stuffs"
  I haven't updated this guide for a long time. And now I must do. This 
"Other Stuffs" could help you know more about the current whole story of 
Resident Evil series and it would be updated following the time. I write 
my review for you that just lets you know how the game is as I think and 
make sure of your decision when you decide to buy or rent. 
  My intension is to make the "Maps" menu for this FAQS. But the 
starting new school year confuses me. I must attend to my study. But I 
would try to make this guide more perfect, early or late.

7/ D.I.F.F.I.C.U.L.T.I.E.S.

***********************************************************************

* TRAINING : The easiest mode with double numbers of ammo, ink ribbons
and only a few monsters. With this mode, you can use your ammo funnily
and don't worry about running out.
* STANDARD :  Normal mode. The monsters are not very hard. Ammo is
enough to use. Try to keep a balance in this mode. Don't so "happy",
especially to play with Chris.
* ADVANCED : Hard mode. The monsters are many and stronger. Ammo is the
same as Standard. The items are changed position. Your characters's
costume are different in this mode. Try to be economical as much as you
can : avoid any zombies in your effort, especially with the guy Chris
(again).

------------------------
 ADVISE BEFORE PLAYING
------------------------
- As your mode you choose, try to play well which is appreciate with
the environment.
- Avoid any enemies in your effort when you are running out of ammo.
Combat knife is a bit hard to use in this game.
- Pay attention to anything unusual on your way.
- Keep a safe distance when fighting enemies.
- Try to use the Item Box anytime when your inventory is full.
- When a zombie falls on the floor, if you don't see its blood, that
means it hasn't died yet. Aim down to finish it. If you pass over when
it's still alive, it will eat your leg.
- Chris begins with :
    + 6 inventory slots
    + Combat knife
    + First Aid Spray
- Jill begins with :
    + 8 inventory slots
    + Combat knife
    + Beretta Handgun 
    + First Aid Spray
- If you are new in this game, play with Jill first.

 - Your health is showed by the ECG in the menu screen :

 HEALTH GUIDE
--------------

  COLOUR                 HEALTH                PERCENT
 Green                    Fine                 100%- 75%
 Green + yellow line      Fine                 75% - 50%
 Orange                   Caution              50% - 25%
 Red                      Danger               25% - 10%
 Purple + green line      Poison               75% - 50%
 Purple + yellow line     Poison               50% - 25%
 Purple + red line        Poison               25% - 0%

- Poison effect turns "Purple with Green line" into "Purple with Red 
line" into...death for a slow time. So use Serum or Blue Herbs as soon as 
possible when you are poisoned. This is the good point of Resident Evil 
1. Because in the later Resident Evil, Poison effect is only a purple 
that you can't guess when you will die. In Chris's scenario, when Chris 
is poisoned by the huge snake and if you take control of Rebecca, try to 
find the Serum as soon as possible. If you are slow, Chris could die 
even you don't take control of him.

 HERB MIXING 
-------------

 - Herb mixing guide :

   HERBS                    HEALING PERCENT
 Green + Green               heal 50%
 Green + Green + Green       heal 100%
 Green + Red                 heal 100%
 Green + Red + Blue          heal 100% + cure Poison

- You can read more information about the herbs in "Botany Book" file in 
the library. 

--------------
 DAMAGE NOTES
--------------
- A bite of a zombie make random damage. Sometimes it only causes "Fine" 
to "Fine" (Green color with yellow line). But in Advance Mode, a strong 
bite of it can cause you from "Fine" to "Danger" immediately. Just be 
careful with your health. A bite at feet is often half a bite at neck. 
- A scratch of dog is often half an ordinary bite of zombie. But it can 
confuse you that you can't determine your target because dogs often 
attack in multiple. So the best way is not to let it scratch you, okay ? 
- A bite of huge snake makes a big damage with Poison effect. See the 
note about "Poison effect" I wrote upper. Just remember to save your 
character immediately. Only two or three hits of the snake can take you 
to see "Mr.Death". 
- Your life is always threatened when meeting a Hunter, of course. A 
simple hit of Hunter at your feet just lower one level of your health. 
But Hunters never beat a simple hit. They beat in sequence of hits, 
remember. The second is almost the similar to the first but weaker. 
But...don't be so happy, when you make them furious, just two slices to 
your head can make you die immediately even you are in complete health. 
Can you imagine what happen if two Hunters attack you in two sides ? To 
tell you the truth, you will have no time to shoot them and stand until 
you die. See "Monster list" and have a good strategy for them.
- Two strong bites of the annoying Neptune can kill you at once. Why ? A 
bite of it causes "Fine" to "Orange Caution". Run like hell !!!
- A bite of Chimaera lowers one level of health. But a strike from the 
ceiling is stronger. Just try to avoid their ways and shoot them by 
Magnum. You can't run as fast as they do. Honest ! 
- Those small snakes or spiders can only make a very small that doesn't 
affect too much your health. 
- A strike of Plant 42 often lowers half-one health level. The damage of 
the white powder from the ceiling is weaker. But your health sometimes 
can be poisoned. Frequently check it. 
- Black Widows attack by dropping Poisonous liquid or striking. Just be 
careful with the liquid. Its strike makes half damage of a zombie hit. I 
don't know if it has ever bitten your body like Resident Evil Code 
Veronica.       
- Tyrant...a sequence of hits. Almost the same as Hunter's slice, it can 
quickly move you to the another world. Just frequently check your 
health.

  CHRIS REDFIELD'S WALKTHROUGH
================================

 9.1/ THE MANSION
  After talking to Wesker and Jill in the main hall, go to investigate
the dining room. Go to the right door to one of the end of the
corridor. Something terrible is acting on your eyes. Avoid the zombie
and return to the hall, Chris doesn't see Jill and Wesker. Let him
collect Jill's gun and continue. If you return to the place where you
first meet the zombie and shoot, check the corpse it was eating, you'll
realize it's Kenneth. Get two clips from him and there are nothing to
do here. Return to the main hall, go upstairs. In the right there are
two doors. You should go to the deeper door and get the Small Key. If
you go out, you'll see Forest Speyer's corpse. Get his clip (be careful
of the crowns). Return to the 2nd floor hall and go to the left room.
Shoot the zombies here and push the right blue statue forward, until
you meet a space with no balcony, let it drop below. Then go to the
next door, kill some zombies here and go downstairs. Go to the nearest
room (medical room) and talk to Rebecca. Then get the Sword Key on the
bed. Now go out. You'll see there are two another doors. One of them is
locked with a carved of Armor. Ignore it and get into the other. If you
go forward, you'll come to the garden. There are some tentacles that
don't let you go pass the fountain. Ignore them and get out. Turn to
the left and check three rooms. The first has a Tiger statue-nothing.
Get into the second door (using Sword Key) to get a clip and Shotgun
Shells (hehehe...there are something sudden here). Go to the third room
to return to the corridor behind the dining room. Get into the dining
room and get Blue Jewel (from the broken statue). Put this jewel on the
Tiger statue to get the Wind Crest. In the corridor, use Sword Key to
open the red door in the left of the end of the room and go in. Find
the right corner of the room and push the wardrobe to get Music Notes.
Put the Music Notes on the piano and..."Chris unfortunately can't read
music." Now you need Rebecca. And she goes in soon to play it for you.
Answer "Yes" or "No" are both okay. Let she play it and go out. Go to
the main hall to the blue door. You can reach the map by climbing the
steps. If you go to the red way, you'll meet a lying zombie. Don't pass
over it or you'll be bitten. If you try, your rewards are only some Ink
Ribbons. Use Sword Key to open the brown door beside and get in. Go
pass the hall and fight the dogs. Notes : Here there are some blank
shelves that don't contain anything. You can push those to get clips.
The next door is a corridor, too. Here there is a room locked by Armor
Key - ignore. There is a restroom-get into it, get rid of the dirty
water in the bath tub and get Small Key. Get out. The third room has a
Shotgun-don't get it soon. Finally, go to the fourth room, kill some
zombies here. There are four doors here, too. I remind you to go to the
brown door in the left-the gallery. There are a lot of crowns here. But
if you solve the puzzle well, they don't do anything on you. Each
picture has a switch. The order is :
 - New born baby
 - Infant
 - Lovely boy
 - Young man
 - Tired middle-aged man
 - Old man
 - The end of life
  You'll receive the Star Crest. Get out, go right to another door.
Let's to the end of the path (there are some dogs), you'll see a board
that you can put the crests. Put your Star Crest and Wind Crest on it.
Then return and get to the light blue door (the right brown door is
locked by Helmet Key). Kill a zombie. There is a store room under the
stairs. Get into it, prepare yourself and get the Chemist. Get out and
go upstairs. Shoot the zombies. Some of doors here will help you to
return to a red corridor. The final room of this corridor takes you to
the library and you can get Botany Book to know how to mix herbs. By
this way, return to the 2nd floor main hall. From this hall, you can
return to the garden, use Chemist in the device to kill the tentacles.
Then go pass, there are a lot of herbs here. Try to get them all by
mixing. You also get Armor Key. Now use the Armor Key to open all the
doors you couldn't before. In the corridor which has the medical room,
use Armor Key to open the Desk Room . You'll get a Broken Shotgun. Use
Small Key to open the desk to get Shotgun Shells. In the main hall, you
can use the key to open the door beside the blue door. In this room,
use the Small Key to open the desk get Shotgun Shells. The next door
has a zombie and some herbs. There is a room which is locked by a
special key. I'll tell later in "Secrets" menu. Return to the blue door
in the main hall, pass the light corridor and go to the first room of
the next corridor which was locked by this key. Here there are some
dogs and a lot of herbs. After that, get out and find the room which
has the real Shotgun. Get it and put the Broken Shotgun on its
position, you have just avoided a trap. Go to the fourth door to the
blue door again, go upstairs and find a brown room which is also locked
by this key. Open it. You will see a moose head figure in the center
and two doors in two sides. Go to the left room (Bedroom) to get red
herb and a Lighter. Go to the right room, put the switch on the insect
collection to run out the water in the glass box. Then push it to the
right, push the wardrobe to the corner and open the hidden store, maybe
it's ink ribbon or something. Get out and find the red corridor. Unlock
the emerald door. You will see two statues of ancient soldiers. Push
them to cover two holes on the floor. Then push the red switch in the
center. The gas will make the cage at the end of the room open. Get the
Sun Crest inside. Then use the key to unlock the next door. You'll meet
Richard Aiken here. He is wounded by a huge snake and you must find the
serum to cure him. Get it in the medical room.

 9.2/ THE HUGE SNAKE
  Now return to the restaurant to meet Rebecca. She has played the song
and tried to play it again for you. After that, a secret door opens. Go
to it and get the Gold Emblem. The door will be closed. Put the Emblem
to replace the gold one, you can get out. In the dining room, put the
Gold Emblem on the hole above the fireplace, the grandfather's clock
will move aside. There is the Shield Key inside. Get it and return to
Richard. Although you gives the serum to him, he's still dead because
it's too late. You can get his clip and go to the next room. Shoot a
zombie here. And then turn left (Chris's left) to a room. Use the
Lighter to kindle the candle and get ammo here. Then go out, use Shield
Key to open the next door. Go checking...ready...Fight !!! The huge 
snake
is a bit annoying. It surrounds you that make you can't run to anywhere
except for shooting it. Try to shoot it and heal your health when
necessary. After it runs away, follow it and get the Moon Crest. If you
are poisoned, Chris will be tired for while. There are three cases in
this situation :
- Chris says he's tired. Then you control him to find the serum quickly
or he will die after a long time.
- Chris is tired. Rebecca comes. Then you'll control her to get the
serum for him.
- Chris faints. Rebecca comes and brings him to medical room.
  Which case will happen depends on how you answer Rebecca's questions.
Now put the four crests on the board and continue.

 9.3/ GUARD HOUSE
  In the shed, push the steps to the left, then climb it to get the
Crank. There is a Small Key on a barrel. Then go to the next door,
fight the dogs and get herbs (this is the courtyard). There is a right
path. Now you have nothing to do there so get into the gate. Turn left
and use the Crank to take out the water in the lake. Then pass the lake
and climb. Just run quickly to avoid the small snakes. Then get down on
the lift. Fight some dogs here and go through the gate, overcome the
path to the Guard House. There are some holes on the floor that a
tentacle will bind your neck if you pass them. Push the statue to cover
the hole you want. The right room is for you to store items and get
ammo, F.Aid Spray. Now go to the left room dormitory 001. Fight some
zombies here. Use Small Key to open the desk to get Shotgun Shells. Go
to the corner of the room, get a Small Key in the cup. Grab the Red
Book on the bed. Then get to the restroom, take out the water in the
bathtub and find C.Room Key. You can go to the furthest door, check the
billard to know a code. This code is random. Just remember in some
case. Now turn right to another corridor. There are 002 dormitory and a
greenroom. Beside the dormitory, you can push the statue to get some
herbs. Go to the greenroom to the left path, get the 002 Key and run as
fast as you can or you'll be bitten by the wasps or bees. Now open the
002 dormitory, get some files and push the two wardrobes. If you have
got the Small Key, open the desk you'll receive Shotgun Shells. Climb
down the ladder. Another puzzle about pushing... First, push the two far
boxes into the water. About the first one, push it backward until it
reaches the right path, the move to the wall left which makes a space
between the box and the right wall, then move into the water. Pass them
and go to the water hall. There are three doors. If you turn right
(Chris's right) to the nearest small door, you'll only get a Small Key
here. Go further, you will see two doors together. Go the small door
first by using the C.Room Key. Then switch the level to drain the
water. The next door will be unlocked. Then get into it to get ammo and
003 Key. Now get out of the 002 dormitory, go to the green house to 003
dormitory. In this room, if you open the desk, you'll only receive some
Ink Ribbons. Put the Red Book on the shelf to find a secret door.
You'll meet Plant 42. There are two cases :
- Chris completely fights Plant 42 (He can't fix the chemists)
- Chris is caught by one of the tentacle. You control Rebecca to save
him by mixing the chemists. The chemist room is in the greenroom. If
you remember the code on the billard, just enter it. See the notes on
the wall to make the mixture.
  After finishing the plant, find the Helmet Key and get out of Guard
House.

 9.4/ REVISITED MANSION
  When you go into the mansion for a while, Chris will find a radio of
someone. If you continue, a hunter will chase after you. Use Shotgun to
shoot it. Then try to hear Chris say. If he says Rebecca in the library
(where you collect Botany Book), go there to find her. If he says she
is somewhere in the house, go to the medical room to find her. If you
don't, she can receive a miserable death. It's not necessary. Now the
mansion is full of Hunters - a powerful type of monsters. Try to do
your best with your Shotgun. Now use Helmet Key to open the brown door
at the place where you meet the first Hunter. Turn on the light (the
switch is on the table), get Doom Book I (check it to get the Eagle
Medal)and Magnum rounds. In this room, you can look over the window to
see the moonlight. Then get to te medical room and go upstairs, use
Helmet Key to unlock the black door there to go to "Animal room". Push 
the steps to the moose head, then turn off the light and go on it to get
the Red Jewel. Go to the Tiger statue and put it, you'll receive the
Magnum. This weapon is good at killing Hunters.

 9.5/ FINISHING THE HUGE SNAKE
  Now return to the corridor behind the library, go to the red door at
the end of the the corridor. Here there is a green herb and a paper on
the wall above a fireplace. If you have the Lighter, burn it and you'll
receive a map. Use Helmet Key to open the left door. This is a large
room. Go to the furthest corner of the room and check, the snake
appears again. This is the last time you meet it. I think Shotgun is
good at this. After that, jump down the hole the snake did, put the
switch behind the "tomb" and get down the ladder.

 9.6/ THERE ARE SOME PLACES WE HAVEN'T CHECKED
  There are some zombies here and Shotgun Shells. The next room, you'll
hear the zombie eating. How terrible the sound is ! There are green
herbs there. The next room is the kitchen. Here you get a Small Key. If
you reach the door, a zombie inside will come to attack you. This
zombie is tough. I used 4 Shotgun shots to finish it. The right is the
elevator with a lying zombie. Shoot it and go. In this floor there are
3 zombies, kill them and get a green herb. First, go to the blue door,
shoot the zombies. Use Small Key to open the desk to get Magnum rounds.
Go to another door, you'll meet a room which is full of books (I call
it small library). Push the statue to the yellow square on the floor at
the corner, a secret store is opened. You get a MO disk. Get out to the
previous room, if you check this place, you realize a wardrobe that you
can push. There is a secret door inside (secret room). You can go in to
check it. Now get out and check the deeper door, you'll receive ammo
and Battery. The other door only has zombies and some herbs. In this
room, you can also find another door which takes to 2nd floor only
opened by a code. Only Jill can know this code.
  Get on the elevator and go to the room where the sudden zombie
attacked you. It takes you to the corridor behind the dining room. Now
return to the courtyard. Go to where there is a waterfall, put the
Battery for the lift and go up. It takes you to the right path of the
courtyard. Get out of the gate and use the Crank to fill the water.
Then use the new lift to go down. There's no waterfall and you see a
ladder. Get down.

 9.7/ UNDERGROUND
  There are a lot of areas there. If you checked it, you'll get a F.Aid
Spray and Shotgun Shells. Find Enrico Marini and talk to him. A
mysterious person (maybe it's Wesker)shoots him die and remains the
Hex. Crank on the floor (your current Crank is square). Return to the
first you have just got down the ladder, use the Hex.Crank to move the
hole on the floor. You can pass it and go to the door. Get the
Flamethrower on the wall. Then touch the big rock. Prepare your way.
After touching it and return, it will chase after you. You'll die soon
after it lies on you. So try to run fast and turn. After that, check
the hole behind the rock, you'll receive some ammo. A Hunter will
attack you. Kill it. The rock broke a new way for you. Go to the hidden
door behind it and fight a huge spider. This is not hard. 3 Magnum
rounds can take wipe of it. But if you see the small spiders run out,
get out of the room and return, they'll disappear. Find a Combat knife
on the barrel and cut the webs on the door, then go into it. Go to the
right door to save and store items. When you get out of this room, the
small snakes appear again, just run to the other door, put the
Flamethrower on the right and to unlock and get into it. Use the Hex.
Crank to move the floor until the hole is in the left. There is a door
in it. So get into that door. Another puzzle ! Push the statue to the
position where the wall will rise. Then use the Hex.Crank to rise the
wall. Now there is a distance between the statue and the wall. So push
it to the square switch on the floor and get Doom Book II. Check it to
get Wolf Medal and get out. There is another rock here, just do as the
previous time but it's harder, so be careful ! In the hidden hole there
are ammo and MO disc. Get out of here by the lift.

9.8/ UMBRELLA SECRET LAB
  Get herbs. Put the Eagle Medal and Wolf Medal on the platforms, then
get down by elevator. Climb down the ladder and prepare your items. Get
into the next door, shoots some zombie and then get the Mo disc on the
desk beside the Visual Media Room (which is locked electronically). Go
downstairs. There are a lot of naked zombies here. Try to avoid them if
you can because sometimes they can re-appear when you go to another
place. Now go to the first room you see. This is a corridor which has
three doors here. The third door is only locked when you have enough
passcodes to enter on the right device. The second door is locked
electronically. So get into the first. It's John's room. Read the
letter he writes to Ada and find the what he says in it. Push the
wardrobe aside and put the switch to turn on the blue light. Then view
the picture of Adam and Eva and find the password.
  Then get out to the naked-zombie corridor. Go to the experiment room,
grab the Slide and operate the computer. Try to enter the right
passwords. The login ID is "John". The next password is "Ada". The
password to unlock the door is the symbol in the picture, you find it
yourself. Unlock all the locked area. The second room in the first door
is unlocked. Return to it, bringing a MO disc to get the Passcode 01.
The Visual Media room is unlocked. Go upstairs and get into it.
  In this room, put the Slide into the projector to see some clues
about Umbrella. After that, find a switch on the left wall and turn it.
A rising wall will move away, remain the P.Room Key (Lab Key)inside.
  Okay, go downstairs again. Go to another door which is unlocked, too.
This is another corridor. Find the Autopsy Room. And solve the puzzle
here. Try to push two boxes to cover two holes. Then move the steps
onto the switch which is appreciate to the above hole. Climb it and get
into the other room, bringing another MO disc to get the Passcode 02.
  Return to the corridor and go to the save room if you want. Then get
to the Power Room. There are three areas here. Be careful with the
Chimeras. In the first area, run to find the switch to operate the
electric power. In the second area, try to find the machine to get the
passcode 03 with the last MO disc. In the 3rd area, try to find another
switch to operate the elevator in the corridor. Then get out of the
Power Room. Go to the elevator and have a "talk" with Wesker. Rebecca
can come here if you saved her. Wesker shoots her and takes Chris to
his laboratory to see the T002-Tyrant that he intends to sell to
someone. After some incidents, Wesker gets killed by the Tyrant and
Chris must fight it. Take the Magnum to kill it. This is the most
easiest boss. Just keep a long distance and shoot it. Then get Wesker's
Master Key. That's all.

 9.9/ SAVE YOUR PARTNER-FINAL BATTLE
  Get out of the lab, you'll realize that Rebecca is still alive
because of her protective gear. Go up the elevator and return to the
corridor with the passcode device. Use your three passcodes to open the
door. And then use the Master Key to rescue Jill. Take Jill and Rebecca
to get out of the secret lab and go to the door to airport (beside the
ladder). Grab the Battery to operate the elevator and go on it. Use the
Flare to shoot to the air. Brad Vicker drives the helicopter to bring
you. If you save all your partners, you'll fight the final battle with
Tyrant. You have 3 minutes to go up the elevator and fight it. Try to
run, run like hell, run to avoid its hits. Until over 2 minutes, Brad
will give up the Rocket Launcher for you to shoot it. There are only
two (Standard and Advanced) and four (Training) bullets. So try to
shoot correctly and get on the helicopter.

-----------------------END OF CHRIS'S WALKTHROUGH----------------------

================================
  JILL VALENTINE'S WALKTHROUGH
================================
 9.10/ MANSION
  After talking to Wesker and Barry, go to the dining room with Barry.
When he is checking the blood, go to the next door to see the zombie
eating Kenneth. Also get out and meet Barry, he'll finish it for you.
Go with him to find Wesker in the main hall. Go upstairs and go down.
After the talk, Barry will give you the Lockpick ( its function is like
Chris's Sword Key). Take the Emblem in dining room, get two clips from
Kenneth's corpse, use Lockpick to get into the restaurant. Push the
wardrobe and get the Music Notes. Play the "Moonlight Sonata" on the
piano (Jill is excellent at art). Go to the secret door getting the
Gold Emblem and replace by the Emblem. Put the gold to the hole above
the fireplace and get the Shield Key in the clock. You don't use it, so
put it in item box. Return to the main hall, go upstairs. In the right
there are two doors. You should go to the deeper door and get the Small
Key. If you go out, you'll see Forest Speyer's corpse. Get his Bazooka.
Return to the 2nd floor hall and go to the left room. Shoot the zombies
here and push the right blue statue forward, until you meet a space
with no balcony, let it drop below. Then go to the next door, kill some
zombies here and go downstairs. Go to the nearest room (medical room)
to prepare yourself. Now go out. You'll see there are two another
doors. One of them is locked with a carved of Armor. Ignore it and get
into the other. If you go forward, you'll come to the garden. There are
some tentacles that don't let you go pass the fountain. Ignore them and
get out. Turn to the left and check three rooms. The first has a Tiger
statue-nothing. Get into the second door (using Lockpick) to get a clip
and Shotgun Shells. Go to the third room to return to the corridor
behind the dining room. Get into the dining room and get Blue Jewel
(from the broken statue). Put this jewel on the Tiger statue to get the
Wind Crest. Go to the main hall to the blue door. You can reach the map
by climbing the steps. If you go to the red way, you'll meet a lying
zombie. Don't pass over it or you'll be bitten. If you try, your
rewards are only some Ink Ribbons. Use Lockpick to open the brown door
beside and get in. Go pass the hall and fight the dogs. Notes : Here
there are some blank shelves that don't contain anything. You can push
those to get clips. The next door is a corridor, too. Here there is a
room locked by Armor Key - ignore. The second is the restroom. The
third room has a Shotgun-don't get it soon for safety. Finally, go to
the fourth room, kill some zombies here. There are four doors here,
too. I remind you to go to the brown door in the left-the gallery.
There are a lot of crows here. Solve the puzzle as Chris's walkthrough.
  You'll receive the Star Crest. Get out, go right to another door.
Let's to the end of the path (there are some dogs), you'll see a board
that you can put the crests. Put your Star Crest and Wind Crest on it.
Then return and get to the light blue door (the right brown door is
locked by Helmet Key). Kill a zombie. There is a store room under the
stairs. Get into it, prepare yourself and get the Chemist. Get out and
go upstairs. Shoot the zombies. Some of doors here will help you to
return to a red corridor. The final room of this corridor takes you to
the library and you can get Botany Book to know how to mix herbs. By
this way, return to the 2nd floor main hall. From this hall, you can
reach the garden, use Chemist in the device to kill the tentacles. Then
go pass, there are a lot of herbs here. Try to get them all by mixing.
You also get Armor Key. Now use the Armor Key to open all the doors you
couldn't before. In the corridor which has the medical room, use Armor
Key to open the Desk Room . You'll get a Broken Shotgun. Use Lockpick
to open the desk to get Shotgun Shells. In the main hall, you can use
the key to open the door beside the blue door. In this room, open the
desk and get Shotgun Shells. The next door has a zombie and some herbs.
There is a room which is locked by a special key. I'll tell later in
"Secrets" menu. Return to the blue door in the main hall, pass the
light corridor and go to the first room of the next corridor which was
locked by this key. Here there are some dogs and a lot of herbs. After
that, get out and find the room which has the real Shotgun. Get it and
put the Broken Shotgun on its position, you have just avoided a trap.
Go to the fourth door to the blue door again, go upstairs and find a
brown room which is also locked by this key. Open it. You will see a
moose head figure in the center and two doors in two sides. Go to the
Bedroom to get red herb and Lighter. Go to the right room, put the
switch on the insect collection to run out the water in the glass box.
Then push it to the right, push the wardrobe to the corner and open the
hidden store, maybe it's ink ribbon or something. Get out and find the
red corridor. Unlock the emerald door. You will see two statues of
ancient soldiers. Push them to cover two holes on the floor. Then push
the red switch in the center. The gas will make the cage at the end of
the room open. Get the Sun Crest inside. Then use the key to unlock the
next door. You'll meet Richard Aiken here. He is wounded by a huge
snake and you must find the serum to cure him. Get it in the medical
room. Remember to bring the Shield Key.

 9.11/ THE HUGE SNAKE
  Return to Richard. Although you gives the serum to him, he's still
dead because it's too late. You can get his clip and go to the next
room. Shoot a zombie here. And then turn left to a room. Use the
Lighter to kindle the candle and get ammo here. Then go out, use Shield
Key to open the next door. Go checking and fight the huge snake. Shoot
it and heal your health when necessary. After it runs away, follow it
and get the Moon Crest. If you are poisoned, Jill will be tired for
while. There are two cases in this situation :
- Jill says she's tired. Then you control her to find the serum quickly
or he will die after a long time.
- Jill faints. Barry comes and brings him to medical room.
  Which case will happen depends on where and how many times you meet
Barry (see my added notes). Now put the four crests on the board and
continue.

 9.12/ GUARD HOUSE
  In the shed, push the steps to the left, then climb it to get the
Square Crank. Then go to the next door, fight the dogs and get herbs
(this is the courtyard). There is a right path. Now you have nothing to
do there so get into the gate. Turn left and use the Crank to take out
the water in the lake. Then pass the lake and climb. Just run quickly
to avoid the small snakes. Then get down on the lift. Fight some dogs
here and go through the gate, overcome the path to the Guard House.
  There are some holes on the floor that a tentacle will bind your neck
if you pass them. Push the statue to cover the hole you want. The right
room is for you to store items and get ammo, F.Aid Spray. Now go to the
left room dormitory 001. Fight some zombies here. Use Lockpick to open
the desk to get ammo. Grab the Red Book on the bed. Then get to the
restroom, take out the water in the bathtub and find C.Room Key. You
can go to the furthest door, check the billard to know a code. This
code is random. Just remember in some case. Now turn right to another
corridor. There are 002 dormitory and a greenroom. Beside the
dormitory, you can push the statue to get some herbs. Go to the
greenroom to the left path, get the 002 Key and run as fast as you can
or you'll be bitten by the wasps or bees. Now open the 002 dormitory,
get some files and push the two wardrobes. If you open the desk you'll
receive Shotgun Shells. Climb down the ladder. Another puzzle about
pushing... Do as Chris's walkthrough. Pass them and go to the water 
hall.
There are three doors. If you turn right (Jill's right) to the nearest
small door, there are nothing here. Go further, you will see two doors
together. Go the small door first by using the C.Room Key. Then switch
the level to drain the water. The next door will be unlocked. Then get
into it to get ammo and 003 Key. Now get out of the 002 dormitory, go
to the green house to 003 dormitory. In this room, if you open the
desk, you'll only receive some Ink Ribbons. Put the Red Book on the
shelf to find a secret door. You'll meet Plant 42. There are two cases
:
- Jill completely fights Plant 42 (He can't fix the chemists)
- Jill is caught. Barry saves her and kills the Plant 42 by the
Flamethrower.
- If you let Jill mix the V-Jolt (she can do this), Jill also fights
the Plant 42 but shorter than the complete battle.
  After finishing the plant, find the Helmet Key and get out of Guard
House.

  9.13/ REVISITED MANSION
  When you go into the mansion for a while, a Hunter will chase after
you. Use Bazooka to shoot it if you have ammo. Now the mansion is full
of Hunters - a powerful type of monsters. Try to do your best with your
Shotgun and Bazooka. Now use Helmet Key to open the brown door at the
place where you meet the first Hunter. Turn on the light (the switch is
on the table), get Doom Book I (check it to get the Eagle Medal) and
Magnum rounds. Then get to the medical room and go upstairs, use Helmet
Key to unlock the Black door to go to "Animal room". Push the steps to
the moose head, then turn off the light and go on it to get the Red
Jewel. Go to the Tiger statue and put it, you'll receive the Magnum.

 9.14/ FINISHING THE HUGE SNAKE
  Now return to the corridor behind the library, go to the red door at
the end of the the corridor. Here there is a green herb and a paper on
the wall above a fireplace. If you have the Lighter, burn it and you'll
receive a map. Use Helmet Key to open the left door. This is a large
room. Go to the furthest corner of the room and check, the snake
appears again. This is the last time you meet it. I think Shotgun is
good at this. After that, jump down the hole the snake did. There are
two cases :
- Jill goes down alone
- Barry will come and give Jill the code to open the door beside the
Animal Room. It takes to the same place. So I write the situation if
Jill goes down alone.

 9.15/ THERE ARE SOME PLACES WE HAVEN'T CHECKED
  There are some zombies here and ammo. Head to the kitchen. If you
reach the door, a zombie inside will come to attack you. The right is
the elevator with a lying zombie. Shoot it and go. In this floor there
are 3 zombies, kill them and get a green herb. First, go to the blue
door, shoot the zombies. Open the desk to get Magnum rounds. Go to the
small library. Push the statue to the yellow square on the floor at the
corner, a secret store is opened. You get a MO disk. Get out to the
previous room, if you check this place, you realize a wardrobe that you
can push. There is a secret door inside (secret room). You can go in to
check it. Now get out and check the deeper door, you'll receive ammo
and Battery. The other door only has zombies and some herbs. In this
room, you can also find another door which takes to 2nd floor only
opened by the code Barry gave you.
  Get on the elevator and go to the room where the sudden zombie
attacked you. It takes you to the corridor behind the dining room. Now
return to the courtyard. Go to where there is a waterfall, put the
Battery for the lift and go up. It takes you to the right path of the
courtyard. Get out of the gate and use the Crank to fill the water.
Then use the new lift to go down. There's no waterfall and you see a
ladder. Get down.

  9.16/ UNDERGROUND
  There are a lot of areas there. If you checked it, you'll get a F.Aid
Spray and Grenade rounds. Find Enrico Marini and talk to him. A
mysterious person (maybe it's Wesker)shoots him die and remains the
Hex. Crank on the floor. Return to the first you have just got down the
ladder, use the Hex.Crank to move the hole on the floor. You can pass
it and go to the door. Touch the big rock. Prepare your way. After
touching it and return, it will chase after you. You'll die soon after
it lies on you. So try to run fast and turn. After that, check the hole
behind the rock, you'll receive some ammo. A Hunter will attack you.
Kill it. The rock broke a new way for you. Go to the hidden door behind
it and fight a huge spider. This is not hard. 3 Magnum rounds can take
wipe of it. But if you see the small spiders run out, get out of the
room and return, they'll disappear. Find a Combat knife on the barrel
and cut the webs on the door, then go into it. Go to the right door to
save and store items. When you get out of this room, the small snakes
appear again, just run to the other door. Use the Hex. Crank to move
the floor until the hole is in the left. Go to it and get Doom Book II
as Chris's walkthrough. Check it to get Wolf Medal and get out. There
is another rock here, just do as the previous time but it's harder, so
be careful ! In the hidden hole there are ammo and MO disc. Get out of
here by the lift.

 9.17/ UMBRELLA SECRET LAB
  Get herbs. Put the Eagle Medal and Wolf Medal on the platforms, then
get down by elevator. Climb down the ladder and prepare your items. Get
into the next door, shoots some zombie and then get the Mo disc on the
desk beside the Visual Media Room. Go downstairs. There are a lot of
naked zombies here. Try to avoid them if you can because sometimes they
can re-appear when you go to another place. Now go to the first room
you see. This is a corridor which has three doors here. The third door
is only locked when you have enough passcodes to enter on the right
device. The second door is locked electronically. So get into the
first. It is John's room. Read the letter he writes to Ada and find the
what he says in it. Push the wardrobe aside and put the switch to turn
on the blue light. Then view the picture of Adam and Eva and find the
password.
  Then get out to the naked-zombie corridor. Go to the experiment room,
grab the Slide and operate the computer and do as Chris. Unlock all the
locked area. The second room in the first door is unlocked. Return to
it, bringing a MO disc to get the Passcode 01. The Visual Media room is
unlocked. Go upstairs and get into it.
  In this room, put the Slide into the projector to see some clues
about Umbrella. After that, find a switch on the left wall and turn it.
A rising wall will move away, remain the P.Room Key inside.
  Okay, go downstairs again. Go to another door which is unlocked, too.
This is another corridor. Find the Autopsy Room. And solve the puzzle
here. Try to push two boxes to cover two holes. Then move the steps
onto the switch which is appreciate to the above hole. Climb it and get
into the other room, bringing another MO disc to get the Passcode 02.
  Return to the corridor and go to the save room if you want. Then get
to the Power Room. There are three areas here. Be careful with the
Chimeras. In the first area, run to find the switch to operate the
electric power. In the second area, try to find the machine to get the
passcode 03 with the last MO disc. In the 3rd area, try to find another
switch to operate the elevator in the corridor. Then get out of the
Power Room. Go to the elevator and have a "talk" with Wesker. Barry
comes here and do what Wesker tells him. Wesker asks him to go and
takes Jill to his laboratory to see the T002-Tyrant that he intends to
sell to someone. If Barry is saved, he will return and knock Wesker to
faint to go with you. If not, he'll never come again. After some
incidents, Jill must fight it alone. Take the Magnum to kill it. This
is the most easiest boss. Just keep a long distance and shoot it. Then
get out with Barry (if he is alive). If he isn't there, remember to
take the Master Key.

 9.18/ SAVE YOUR PARTNERS-FINAL BATTLE
  Return to the room where there is the passcode device. Use your three
passcodes to open the door. And then use the Master Key to rescue
Chris. Take him to get out of the secret lab and go to the door to
airport (beside the ladder). You'll meet Barry, too if he is alive.
Grab the Battery to operate the elevator and go on it. Use the Flare to
shoot to the air. Brad Vickers drives the helicopter to bring you. If
you save all your partners, you'll fight the final battle with Tyrant.
You have 3 minutes to go up the elevator and fight it. Try to run, run
like hell, run to avoid its hits. Until over 2 minutes, Brad will give
up the Rocket Launcher for you to shoot it. There are only two
(Standard and Advance) and four (Training) bullets. So try to shoot
correctly and get on the helicopter.

-----------------------END OF JILL'S WALKTHROUGH-----------------------

* NOTES ABOUT ADVANCED MODE

- This mode is like Training or Standard about map and place. So don't
be surprised.
- The item positions are different from the other mode. See my "Item
list" to have your best strategy.
- You can open the Clothes Room without the Special Key.
- The ammo is the same as Standard Mode. But the monsters are many and
stronger. Try to avoid any enemies if you can, especially in the places
where you don't come frequently.
- Frequently collect and mix your herbs. They're very important in this
hard mode.

------
  Okay, for this FAQs is more useful, I decide to make a walkthrough for 
Advance Mode. This is a quick walkthrough which contains the basics and 
item location of this mode because it's almost the same as either 
Training or Standard mode. About the unnecessary episodes such as saving 
or Small Key, I don't mention in this walkthrough as you would know it 
in the full walkthrough for Training and Standard Mode. 
  Notes :
- The order of this guide is optional. You can change them which is most 
convenient for you. Here I only do my duty : write the basics.

===================
 THE SHOTGUN TRAP
===================
  I don't have space to tell you about this trap in Walkthrough. So 
let's see here.
  If you don't use the Broken Shotgun to replace the real one you got,
the ceiling on your way will collapse slowly. Every door is locked. You
have no choice except if you were Jill, Barry can come to rescue you if
you didn't meet him anytime before.

==================
 BARRY'S POSITION
==================
  Barry is Jill's supporter. His appearance which you decide will
determine if he dies or not.
  The first time, you can meet him at :
- Forest's corpse
- The 2nd floor main hall
- Rescue you from the Shotgun trap
- The room where you get Researcher's Note.
  The second time is when you are poisoned after fighting the huge
snake. He'll come to save you or not. I think in this time, you should
save yourself by keeping the serum. This work can make him live.
  If you save yourself in the second time, you'll meet him the third
time in Guard House. You can hear a conversation between him and Wesker
in 002 Dormitory.
  The fourth time is after you finish the huge snake. If you met him
the third time, he'll come. After that, he lives you underground. If
you wait for him to receive the code, he lives. If not, he dies.
  If you wait for him in the fourth time, you'll meet him underground
cave. This time also decides his fate. He asks you two questions. If
you answer "Yes" both them all, he'll die at once (Wesker shoots him).
If you answer "Yes" and "No",that means you don't let him go first, he
can live and go with you to find Enrico.
  Okay, when you encounter Wesker, Barry comes with you and does as
Wesker's order. When you are being taken to the lab, if Barry returns
and knocks out Wesker, that means he is saved. If he doesn't, he dies
near the ladder to the airport way.
  * If you let Barry live, you'll wonder where Wesker is after beating
the Tyrant. Let me tell you that he is at the Power Room as a headless
corpse. You can find him by going there. But as I said in the official
ending, Wesker is still alive. This is not the official episode.
  Generally, the main reasons that make Barry die are :
- You don't meet him after finishing the Huge snake second time.
- Although you meet him there, you don't wait for him to bring you the
code. Try to arrange your strategy.
- In the underground cave, you let him go first.

====================
 REBECCA'S POSITION
====================
  Rebecca is Chris's supporter. As Barry, her fate depends on your
action.
  You first meet her in Medical Room. This is the chart to save her :

   TIMES              REBECCA            CHRIS'S ACTION
-The 1st time    around the mansion       answer "Yes"
-The 2nd time     in the restaurant       "Yes" or "No"
-The 3rd time   near the snake's place        N/A
-The 4th time      Plant 42 room              N/A
-The 5th time      the Library          "She is in the library..."
                                         and save her
-The 6th time      Wesker's lab               N/A

 You can save her in other way :

   TIMES              REBECCA            CHRIS'S ACTION
-The 1st time   in the Medical room       answer "No"
-The 2nd time    in the restaurant       "Yes" or "No"
-The 3rd time  near the snake's place         N/A
-The 4th time          N/A             fights the Plant 42
-The 5th time  near the Medical room   "She is somewhere..."
                                        and save her
-The 6th time      Wesker's lab               N/A

  And if you don't want to save Rebecca, just cancel the 5th
appointment.
  This chart might have some mistakes because there are too many
episodes. So please contact me about my mistakes to make the guide more
perfect.

================
 KEEP THE SERUM
================
  As I said, if you want to save yourself from the huge snake without
any partner, you should have the serum with you and use it. But Richard
took it, what to do ? Okay, after you find the Armor Key, as soon as
find Richard. Then go to get the serum and solve the other problems as
long as you can. Until a certain time, Richard can die before you bring
medicine to him and you keep it. This work is easy to do in Advance
Mode because the position of the key is changed to be nearer.

================================================
 THE ELECTRONICAL LOCKS IN THE LABORATORY AREA
================================================
 There are some readers asking about this. Let me repeat. The answers 
are in the letter John writes to Ada. It's one of the rooms in the first 
corridor you go downstairs to. The answer for the third password is in 
this room, too. If you want to solve the third password, push the beside 
wardrobe to find a blue switch. Before putting it, see the picture of 
Adam and Eve, then remember all the words you see. Push the blue switch, 
the words in the picture will turn into the strange symbols that John 
used to hide the password. Compare it with the original words, you'll 
understand the pasword.

  BOTANY BOOK
---------------
  As you may know, there are many plants that have medicine effects. 
Since ancient times, humans have been healing wounds and diseases using 
various plants. 
  In this book, we're going to sample three herbs that grow around the 
Raccoon Mountains and give their outlines as examples of those plants 
with medicinal properties.
  Each herb has different colors and different effects as medical 
plants: the green one recovers physical strength, the blue one 
neutralize natural toxins, while the red herb does not have any affect 
by itself. The red herb is only effective when it is mixed with other 
herbs.
  For example, if you mix this herb with the herb that recovers physical 
strength, the recovery effect will be triple. By adjusting the amount 
and experimenting with these three herbs, you can create various kinds 
of medicines. But I'll leave the details in your hands, because that is 
the best way to acquire true knowledge.

 KEEPER'S DIARY 
----------------
  May 9th 1998
  At night, we played Poker with Scott the guard, Alias and Steve the 
Researcher.
  Steve was really lucky, but I think he was cheating. What a scumbag.

  May 10th 1998
  Today, a high ranking researcher asked me to take care of a new 
monster. It looks like a gorilla without any skin. They told me to feed 
them live food. When I threw in a pig, they were playing with it... 
tearing off the pig's legs and pulling out the guts before they actually 
ate it.

  May 11th 1998
  Around 5 o'clock this morning, Scott came in and woke me up suddenly. 
He was wearing a protection suit that looks like a space suit. He told 
me to put one on as well.
  I heard there was an accident in the basement lab.
  It's no wonder, those researchers never rest, even at night. 

  May 12th 1998
  I've been wearing this annoying space suit since yesterday. My skin 
grows musty and feels very itchy.
  By way or revenge, I didn't feel those dogs today. 
  Now I feel better. 

  May 13th 1998
  I went to the medical room because my back is all swollen and feels 
itchy. They put a big bandage on my back and the doctor told me I did 
not need to wear the space suit any more. 
  I guess I can sleep well tonight.

  May 14th 1998
  When I woke up this morning, I found another blister on my foot. It 
was annoying and I ended up dragging my foot as I went to the dogs pen. 
They have been quiet since morning, which is unusual. I found that some 
of them escaped. 
  I'll be in real trouble if some of the higher-ups find out.

  May 15th 1998
  Even though I didn't feel well, I decided to go see Nancy. It's my 
first day off in a long time. But I was stopped by the guard on the way 
out. They say the company has ordered that no one leave the grounds. I 
can't even make a phone call. What kind of joke is this ?!

  May 16th 1998
  I heard a researcher who tried to escape from this mansion was shot 
last night.
  My entire body feels burning and itchy at night.
  When I was scratching the swelling on my arms, a lump of rotten flesh 
dropped off.
  What the hell is happening to me ?

  May 19th 1998
  Fever gone but itchy.
  Hungry and eat doggy food.

  Itchy
  Tasty.

--------------------
  RESEARCHER'S WILL 
--------------------
  My dear Alma,
  The fact that you have received this letter is both a joy and sadness 
for me.
  I could not even talk to you because of that guy in the sunglasses. 
Alma, be calm and read this.
  I think I've told you that I moved to pharmaceutical company's lab. 
They headhunted me.
  Last month, there was an accident in the lab and the virus we were 
studying escaped.
  All my colleagues who were infected by the virus are dead. To be 
accurate, they've become living dead.
  They still wander around. Some of them are knocking on my room door 
desperately right now. But there's no sign of intelligence in their 
eyes.
  That cursed virus takes away all humanity from the human brain. Love, 
Joy, sorrow, fear, humor,... eternally.
  And Alma, even the memories of the days I spent with you...
  Yes, I'm infected.
  I did everything I could, but I could only delay the progress by a few 
days.
  The most frightening thing is, that I forget more about you by the 
day. So I chose a peaceful death, rather than become the living dead. 
Withing an hour, I will have entered my eternal sleep. I do hope you'll 
understand my decision...
  Goodbye and Forever Yours,
                                 Martin Crackhorn

  PLANT 42 REPORT 
-------------------
  4 days have passed since the accident and the plant at point 42 is 
growing amazingly fast.
  It has been effected by the T-virus differently than other plants have 
been and shows unique shape in addition to its size. Looking at the way 
it behaves, it is now difficult to determine what kind of plant it was 
originally. 
  There are two ways in which Plant 42 gathers nutrition. The first is 
through its root that reaches into the basement. Immediately after the 
accident, a scientist went mad and broke the water tank in the basement. 
Now the basement is filled with water. It is easily imaginable that some 
chemical elements were blended in the water and promotes the incredibly 
fast growth of Plant 42. 
  Another part of Plant 42 from the basement grows through the duct and 
hangs down like so many bulbs from the ceiling of the first floor. Many 
vines come out of those bulbs and they are the second resource for its 
nutrition. 
  Once sensing movement, Plant 42 shoots its vines around the prey and 
holds it. Then it starts sucking up blood, using the suckers located at 
the back of its vine.
  It also has some intelligence. It blocks the door by twinning its 
vines around it especially when it captures prey or is sleeping. Several 
staff members have already fallen victim to this. 
                            May 21st 1998
                            Henry Sarton

-------------------
  "V-JOLT" REPORT  
-------------------
  As I started in the last report, there are some common features found 
in the cells of the plant infected by the Tyrant virus. We also have 
found another interesting fact through some experiments. 
  We found an element that destroys these rapidly in "UMB No.16", one of 
the series of UMB chemicals that we used for that experiment. We named 
this "UMB No.16" as "V-Jolt". 
  In our calculation it will take less than 5 seconds to destroy Plant 
42 if we put the "V-jolt" directly on the root. 
  You need to mix some of the UMB series chemicals in a specific order 
to create a "V-Jolt". But the UMB series chemicals may generate a 
poisonous gas which is harmful to the human body. Extreme caution should 
be taken when handling these chemicals. 
  Following are the types of UMB series chemicals and their brief 
characteristics. 
    UMB No.2  Red               NP-003   Purple
    UMB No.4  Green             Yellow-6 Yellow
    UMB No.7  White
    UMB No.13 Blue (stimulating smell)  
    V-JOLT (UMB.No 16) Brown

                    Raccoon Times May 27th 1998
  Animal Attack ? Woman Mutilated
  May 20th. At around 10pm a 20-year-old young woman's body was found by 
a baser-by on the left bank of Marble River in the Older District of 
Raccoon City. 
  Raccoon police assume it to be a grizzly or other animal's doing 
because there are teeth marks along her mutilated arms and left foot 
that show considerable power. Since she was wearing a hiking boot on her 
remaining foot, it has been determined that she was attacked in the 
Arklay Mountains and fell into the river. They are hurrying to identify 
this woman. 

                    Raccoon Weekly June 16th 1998
  Monsters In Arklay Mountains ?
  Some people claim they've seen monsters in the Arklay Mountains. The 
monsters are supposedly about the same size as large dogs and usually 
run in a pack as wolves do.
  This may sound like a group of ordinary wild dogs, but these monsters 
are surprisingly fierce and hard to hurt. 
  They say these dogs won't bother you unless you wake them, so you 
smart readers should stay out of the Arklay Mountains for the time 
being. But if you're looking for adventure, check it out ! You wanna try 
?

                            Raccoon Times
  Mystery On Arklay Mountains ! Mountain Road Blocked
  Due to excessive disasters in the Arklay Mountains, the city 
authorities have decided to block the road leading to the foothills.
  At the same time, Raccoon police intend to begin the search for lost 
people with the help of S.T.A.R.S. Team members. They expect great 
difficulty because of the vast size of the Arklay Mountains and the 
primeval forest that covers most of the area. Also people are still 
reporting sightings of grotesque monsters in the mountains.

  RESEARCHER'S LETTER 
-----------------------
  June 8th 1998
  Dear Ada,
  Ada, by the time you read this. I'll be something... different. Today's 
test turned out to be positive, just as I expected. I feel like going 
crazy when I think about becoming one of them.
  Ada, you are not infected and I hope you never will be. In case you 
are the last one left, take the material in the Visual Data Room and go 
to the Power Room to operate the Triggering System before you escape. 
And make all this public through the media. 
  If everything is in order, all the locks can be opened by the security 
system. You can access the system if you log in with my name from the 
terminal in the small lab and enter the password. The password is your 
name. To unlock the door at B2 where the Visual Data Room is located, 
you'll need to access with our name first and then enter another 
password. 
  I've written the code below. I'm sure you'll understand it easily. And 
this is my last hope - if you find me completely changed, please kill me 
yourself.

  From : Special Committee on Disasters Raccoon Special Research Dept
  This memorandum is strictly confidential and must be destroyed as soon 
as it is understood.
  Regarding the "T-virus" outbreak which occurred recently, this 
Committee conducted a field survey. According to the results, estimates 
on the amount of damage caused by the accident are considerably greater 
than reported earlier. 
  First, although it is very difficulty to obtain accurate data in terms 
of actual numbers, it is thought that more than half of the researchers 
died after exposure to the "T-virus". The body count will almost likely 
increase since nearly all of the survivors show symptoms peculiar to the 
"T-virus". Second, our security system is still in operation. However, 
our special security guard squad has been nearly destroyed. Because of 
that, research information considered by our company to be top secret 
has been made available to outsiders. Counter-measures should be taken 
as soon as possible.
  Finally, many of the "subjects" from the experiments have escaped and 
are out of control. We believe that some of the researchers were killed 
by these "subjects" and their bodies were mutilated. 
  By a curious coincidence, these events are proof of the success of our 
research. However, there is also a very high risk that his news may be 
leaked to the press if we don't act immediately.
  The condition is very serious. Our operation to cover-up the situation 
is difficult to attain, however we hope the problem will be solved 
quickly.
  We are especially concerned that the State Police and S.T.A.R.S. are 
intervening too quickly.
  We need to act on this situation as well.

 QUICK STRATEGY
-----------------
  This guide is for expert players who want to make a record of time and 
get the secret hidden screens. Let's begin.
- Prepare for you a certain strategy before playing
- Run as fast as you can whenever and wherever. 
- Try to get all ammo on your way. Don't pass them because to return is 
a waste of time. This work is not necessary in Training Mode.
- Avoid any enemies you can.
- You must know what you'll do and where you'll go next. To wander is 
such a waste of time. 
- When preparing, always arrange the orders of work which is fastest and 
most convenient.
- Don't read or collect any files. You can't believe how long it lasts.
- Don't pick up any unnecessary items.  
- Don't make any unnecessary work (such as making the V-Jolt)
- Don't go to unnecessary place that has nothing to do. 
- Always mix your herbs. Don't use in one except you really need it 
badly.

 INTRODUCTION OF TREVOR'S NOTES
--------------------------------
  Raccoon City
  A city in the Western part of America. Within a deep forest on the 
outskirts of this city there is a mansion, which seems strangely quiet.

  November 13th 1967
  A man was standing if front of the mansion. It was George Trevor, a 
famous architect from New York, who had designed this place from 
scratch. The owner of the mansion, Ozwell E. Spencer, had invited him 
with all his family in order to thank him for the level of the 
perfection in his work.
  Overflowed with work, Trevor initially sent his wife Jessica and her 
14 year old daughter Lisa before joining them later. Unfortunately, when 
Trevor arrived on the spot, he didn't find his wife nor the child. 
Trevor too would mysteriously disappear upon entering the mansion.
  Where could they all have disappeared to then ?
  The following comes from a small diary written while Trevor was in the 
mansion. Spencer paid a fortune for this mansion. The construction alone 
took 5 years of Trevor's life. Why did he devote so much time to it ? 
And did Trevor already know that thirty years later other strange things 
would happen in this mansion ? Personally I feel that this small diary 
will be the key to understand all these mysteries.

  TREVOR'S NOTES 
-----------------
  November 13th 1967
  After having finished my work and leaving New York I finally arrived 
at the Mansion around 6.00pm. The hall is very spacious. The central 
stairs leading to the second floor are also impressive. All these things 
make me nostalgic all over again. 
  Designing the plans of this place is the work I'm most proud of.
  From the day I first showed the model to Ozwell E. Spencer in his 
office, until the completion of the building, took me 5 years. Spencer's 
orders were really difficulty and I had to call upon all of my energy 
and ingenuity to realize it. 
  At first sight no one would suspect anything to be out of the 
ordinary. While turning to face me, Lord Spencer shakes the white hairs 
from his shoulders.
  He has an impressive stature, and at the first glance, one can feel 
that he has a high level of self-confidence. He initially announces me 
that my wife Jessica and my daughter returned to visit their aunt Emma, 
who is ill, and then we lift our glasses and toast. We are only ones to 
know about the numerous secrets contained within this building. Deeply 
satisfied with the complicity, we taste the wine. 
  The dining room is amazing. There is an incredible variety of food 
laid out hammoniously on a large table in mahogany wood. When someone 
would raise their eyes, they could see a statue of a goddess, in "Rodin" 
style, on the second floor which seems to observe is with desire. But 
despite all this splendor, the banquet can only be enjoyed by two guests 
(Spencer and I). We only hear the quiet clicking noise of the clock 
needles. Ahhh, if only Jessica and Lisa were there. 
  According to Spencer, they arrived three days before me and 
appreciated the house well. Lisa in particular benefited from the 
Spencer's kindness and was able to use the piano among others. She 
reportedly played the "Moonlight Sonata" of Beethoven (her specialty). 
In this evening of full moon where the melody seemed to surpass the 
satellite floating above the forest which surrounds the house, Spencer 
had congratulated my wife for this superb moment. I imagine proudly that 
their two faces had to illuminated with pleasure. 

  November 14th 1967
  Lord Spencer guided me around in the mansion. He opened the doors of 
several rooms. Those rooms are decorated with the most marvelous at 
pieces : painting of De Vinci, sculpture of Raphael...
  In one of the rooms the eye of a stuffed beast has strangely sparkled, 
and in another room armors of Middle Age Knights were aligned in good 
order close to their captain.
  All these art pieces were collected by Lord Spencer during past years 
and he deserves well to be one of the richest man on earth.
  "Do you like that ? I wish to use this residence as a seaside resort, 
for a new company. I foresaw that, not only for the employees, but also 
for the guests could use it."
  His project is to design an international industrial medicine company. 
He told me that its company would be called "Umbrella". But I wonder why 
he hid as many things in his residence. He can say that he wants to make 
a seaside resort but it's exaggerated. Even in the case his actions had 
been led by his passion. 

  November 18th 1967
  My family hasn't come back yet. "Is aunt Emma that sick ?". I doubt 
it. The telephone is not installed, which is not very convenient. I went 
out to second floor terrace to clear my mind. Crows, perched on a rail, 
looked at me and pushed strange croaking.
  I had a dark intuition. I continuously have the strange impression of 
being observed... I saw an astonishing thing, in a small court. It is a 
ladder leading down into an underpass, which is masked by a 
waterfall."It is not my work. When was this thing built then ?"

  November 20th 1967
  There is no trace of the shotgun my wife had offered Spencer for is 
birthday. I'm smoking a cigarette in the room where a broken shotgun can 
be found and estimate that it can fool people and pass for the original. 
I wonder who exchanged Spencer's shotgun for this unusable shotgun and 
why ?
  Neither my wife nor my daughter have reappeared and I getting very 
concerned. My rich employer informed me that my family and I couldn't 
remain at the mansion any longer and when I suggested that I could join 
them tomorrow, he laughed and said that it was useless to worry myself 
like that.

  November 21st 1967
  Luggage was gathered and somebody led me into a large room, without 
openings, on the first floor reserved for the receptions. As the Lord 
hadn't arrived yet, I was observing the painting in company of a man in 
a white blouse. He was one of the three unknown men on the courtyard. 
  "Life is rich and short". On the painting, which were exposed on the 
wall, time was represented by the life of a man, from his birth to his 
death. 
  "Your family died, now" -laughed the man while he was looking at me 
styly. Time seemed to stop. What was he talking about ? At the same 
moment I felt a terrible pain at the bottom of my neck, and I broke down 
on the floor. 

  November 24th 1967
  How could he have become this kind of man ? What happened here ? And 
what is the objective of this company called "Umbrella" ?
  I was imprisoned in this room and time passed slowly. "The objective 
is to keep all this as a secret, and since you are an unknown...". One 
day, a man in a white blouse said this to me while bringing revolting 
food.
  What secret is more important than a human life ?
  Lord Spencer and me are the two only ones to know the secrets of this 
manor, and if I die, he will be the only holder of this knowledge. Is it 
for that reason we have these creatures which prowl around the premises 
of the Manor ? I cannot remain here and be eaten of worse. It is 
necessary that I escape from here.
  The question is to know if, since the beginning, I didn't quite simply 
build my own prison. When I was creating this manor, and in accordance 
with Lord Spencer's strange fascination for enigmas, I conceived a way 
to escape for whoever would find himself imprisoned there. 
  It would seem that Lord Spencer wants to test this mothod on me...
  At this moment, one of the countless creatures which infest the floor 
and the ceiling, fell from the ceiling onto my body. For an unknown 
reason, it seemed to attract them. I jumped instinctively backwards and 
while getting upright I trampled a great number of them. What are these 
creatures ? Ants ? 

  November 27th 1967
  I finally succeeded to escape from this room. But nobody can exit from 
the Manor on snap of a finger. You need the crests, the missing eye from 
the Tiger's statue and the Gold Emblem. I can't occupy myself find 
something else ! I have no time for this.

  November 28th 1967
  I can't find the words for it. A plant, absurdly gigantic, fills a 
whole room. God could not have created such a thing.

  November 30th 1967
  It is impossible to get out. It is impossible to come out of the room. 
A phantom laboratory, leading into a kind of underground cave without 
visible exit. And finally, I found it :
  One of the high-heeled shoes and the memory, that behind all it I will 
find a passage. Jessica. Were my wife and my daughter subjected to the 
same destiny as me ? No, I will escape at all cost, as they did before 
me. 

  December 5th 1967
  My throat is dehydrated. I didn't eat for many days and I don't know 
how much time I'll still resist. I am becoming insane.
  Why ? Because I am like a rat, hopeless trying to escape from a 
laboratory labyrinth. Does my fascination for the abnormal architect of 
this residence was no reprehensible ? 

  December 7th 1967
  I am in a dark and wet underground secret conduit. And there, 
suddenly, something monstrous opposite of me... I scrape my last match 
with a trembling hand. A tombstone is here with my name engraved on it. 
What kind of a psychopath would make a similar thing ?
  "George Trevor" isn't me ? Spencer calculated since the beginning, 
that I would come up to here to take my breath, and prepared my tomb. 
Realizing, with success, to direct my attention away from each useful 
way to escape. Jessica, please forgive me. Little time... It's the time 
that remains me before joining you in paradise.
                                George Trevor 
    
-------------------------
  ORIGINAL BARRY BURTON 
-------------------------
  Oh yeah, all of you who have played this game know about an important 
character named Barry Burton. In Resident Evil 1, the characters we know 
are Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Barry Burton, Albert Wesker and some 
other S.T.A.R.S. member. But do you know that Barry has another design 
before him ? Chris and Jill weren't changed. But Jill's first supporter 
is a giant guy named Gelzer. He was also a S.T.A.R.S. member who is 
giant and "ugly". But later Capcom replaced this character by Barry 
Burton we have already known. About the reason why... I don't know. In 
addition to this, important characters in Resident Evil 1 also consisted 
of Edward Dewey, the tall guy who is the pilot of Bravo Team appears in 
the game. But in current versions, we don't see this guy. We only see 
him in a few scenes of Resident Evil 0.

***********************************************************************
===============
 A. BIOHAZARD
===============
  Biohazard is the Japanese version which is almost like the later
version but has no difficult. The game itself is the Training mode of
Resident Evil Director's Cut which is easy to play.

==================
 B. RESIDENT EVIL
==================
  The later version which is written in English. Resident Evil has two
mode : Original and Arrange. Original game is the same as Standard Mode
of REDC. Arrange game is the same as Advance Mode. It was released for
Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn. This game is considered as the
greatest game in 1996 because of modern graphic and 3D images.

==================================
 C. RESIDENT EVIL FOR SEGA SATURN 
==================================
  The most complete version of Resident Evil was made for Sega Saturn. 
This version has an added mini-game as Battle Mode. 
  Hm... This battle game is almost the same as the one of Resident Evil 
Code Veronica. You get it from a Saved file after beating up the game. 
You go in a fixed map and kill monsters on your way by provided ammo. 
Bring at least 2 healing items, then bring some powerful weapon, such as 
the Shotgun to play. You'll run into some strong enemies such as Tyrant 
and a Wesker zombie. Be careful !!!
 
========================
 D. RESIDENT EVIL BETA
========================
  Maybe this one is released before Resident Evil. It's almost the same
but but some episodes are changed. This is the difference :

                                     corpse looks like Barry but it's
                                     really Kenneth.

-The dining room has no zombies.     -The dining room has several

  There are a lot of modifications in the beta version. Here I only
tell you the clearliest episodes you can see. The other changes are
about Items's positions and playing order.

====================================================
 E. RESIDENT EVIL DIRECTOR'S CUT DUAL SHOCK EDITION
====================================================
 The latest version which isn't different from Resident Evil Director's 
Cut so much. The control is dual shock. The music and graphic are 
scarier. And the rest...completely the same.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
  MY OWN REVIEW ABOUT THIS GAME   \~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I'm a big fan of Resident Evil series. Now I want to share my opinion 
about Resident Evil 1 - the first game of series with everyone. First, I 
want to tell why I like this series. 
  I didn't like games on investigation or exploring because they're 
usually complex, hard and confusing that make me think. I hated, hated 
them very much. But when I saw my friend playing Resident Evil 1 and 
kept track of what he did, I felt something interesting in the game. 
Later, I bought it and tried once. Oh, how exciting the game was ! the 
graphic is lively, the characters were cool, the enemies were quite 
good, etc that fascinated me. The puzzle were not so hard as I had ever 
thought. It was not only real but funny as well. I thought that I had to 
buy all this series. And I have done that until now. 

  Gameplay 10/10
  Funny, thrilling, exciting and new. These words are enough for me to 
describe this game. I played it and I'm playing it. It still has a lot 
of things I still don't feel boring and I want to play more. It still 
keeps its own horror although the players have played very much, such as 
me or my friends. 

  Storyline 10/10
  One of the simple reason's is that I like biology. Yeah, this is a 
game whose content is about the long battle of biology, or we can call 
"biohazard" as its Japanese name. The story is lively and real for the 
current world, not like some stories of other games which are full of 
useless fantasies and "dreams". 

  Graphic 8/10 
  Although its graphic wasn't so perfect, it was all right that time. 
Resident Evil 1 deserved to be the great game of 1996 about graphic as 
everyone supposed. Now it can't be compared with the later modern 
Resident Evil but it is still remembered as the glorious birth of 
series. 

  Sounds 9/10 
  It was the greatest sound system I has ever seen. Before it, I had 
played a lot of games whose sounds are only made very badly simply that 
I can't suffer. The sounds of feet, things, the cries of people and 
conversation etc. They were the perfect sound at that time. 

  Length 10/10 
  A balance. The game is not so long but it's not so short, too. It is 
long enough for the players to realize its attraction. The players would 
be angry for the missing short game. But they are also boring for a long 
game with useless episodes. This is a great point. 

  Battle System 8/10
  I hope it would be more various. This game is so simple about battle 
system, even the later ones. My friends and I always complained :"These 
police don't know martial arts !!!" 

  Replayability 10/10
  As I wrote, it always deserves to be replayed. Don't believe ? Just 
try it if you are a new player. You will know there are more things you 
can't guess after beating it only once.
  
  My conclusion is to buy... for a big fan like me. Or if you just want to 
see what it is and beat it once, you can rent. But I affirm that this is 
a good game, yeah... a good game ! 

  Overall score : 8/10 (not an average)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\  
  WESKER'S REPORT   \~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   "Wesker's report" is the bonus DVD disc that will be released with
Resident Evil Code Veronica X when it's sold. Some information said that 
its original version was released for some months in Japan. And the 
purpose which Capcom release this part might be to answer some unknown 
questions about the game that the fans always wonder. I want to write 
some parts of this report for you to know few about it :

  "My name is Albert Wesker.
   I aspired to become a leading researcher at Umbrella Inc. A
pharmaceutical enterprise who covertly conduction Bio Organic Weapons,
better known as B.O.W., for development. But at the leader development
training ground situated in Raccoon city, I met a brilliant and
talented researcher who decided to take a different path, William
Birkin.
   In time I shifted my position to S.T.A.R.S., a special force unit of
the Raccoon Police Department. Umbrella, for crisis management reasons
of their illegal Bio Organic Weapons development had many of its people
working in the police department.
   I became the leader of S.T.A.R.S. and conducted all sorts of
intelligence activities for Umbrella. As I continued to serve I devised
my own plans and waited for the right time moment to execute them.
   Then at last, opportunity knocked.

 - 1998 - July 24th -
   The freak murder incidents had occurred in the forest near the
mansion started it all. The mansion was Umbrella's secret BOW
laboratory and it was clear that the indevelopment T-virus was the
cause of the murder.
   Initially, Umbrella instructed me secretively to keep S.T.A.R.S. to
the mansion, dispose of them, then report the situation to headquarters
so that their combat with the B.O.W. could be used for data analysis
allowing Umbrella a comprehensive portrait of the B.O.W.'s combat
abilities.
   From the two S.T.A.R.S. teams I first pitched in the Bravo Team. As
expected, the top elite of S.T.A.R.S. gave all they had and became
useful sample data. Then following, I geared up the Alpha Team to
"search and rescue" the lost Bravo Team. The members of Alpha Team also
proved theor worth and as expected many died.
   There was five survivors from the initial eleven S.T.A.R.S. members.
From the Alpha team were Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Barry
Burton. And from the Bravo Team were Rebecca Chambers and Enrico
Marini.
   It was time to begin executing my plans. In the midst of the whole
affair I could take Umbrella's ultimate Bio-Organic Weapon, the Tyrant,
and join forces with an opposing corporation of Umbrella. To buy into
that opposing corporation I would need the actual combat data of the
Tyrant.
   The surviving privileged members of S.T.A.R.S. were just the perfect
bait. I decided to have one of them play the Judas and draw them to the
Tyrant.
   That Judas was Barry.
   Barry was the strong truth and justice kind and cherished his family
more than anything. His type is easy to manipulate. I just took that
most important thing away from him. My only miscalculation was the high
potential of Chris and Jill. But with the family man Barry playing
Judas the scheme went as planned.
   Then the winds turn unexpectedly.
   I had to eliminate Enrico who found out what was behind it all. I
used Barry to get to him. After I successfully got rid of that nuisance
I awaited the sample specimen that Barry would bring to me in the
Tyrant room.
   I injected the virus I obtained from Birkin in advance. If I made
Umbrella believe I was dead, it made it far more convenient to sell
myself to the opposing corporation. According to Birkin the virus had
profound effects. It would put my body in a state of temporary "death".
It would then bring me back to life with super human powers. Therefore
I unleashed an awesome Tyrant from its slumber and let it attack me.
  As my consciousness faded away I was certain that the whole scheme
would end in success.
  Never did I imagine that S.T.A.R.S. could slay the evil creation. I
lost the Tyrant and the plan I devised which cost me my humanity ended
in failure. Now anything and anyone who stood in my way would be
terminated. It's been that way for a long time and it always will be.At
all cost I had to make S.T.A.R.S. pay.

 - September -
   Two months had passed since the mansion incident. To regain
everything I had lost in my new organization I joined hands with Ada
Wong, a female agent who was also sent to spy on Umbrella.
   I knew in my bones that the key developer was William Birkin, but
what he didn't know was that Umbrella did not play games...with anyone.
Eventually, Birkin would be assassinated, and the G-virus would be in
the hands of Umbrella.
   But the salvage team led by Hunk was ahead of us. By the time they
got to Birkin, he'd already injected himself with the G-virus...he 
became
his own creation, and decimated them.
   Soon after, the T-virus carried by rats spread throughout Raccoon
city, and Umbrella faced its worst scenario.

 - September 28th -
   The good citizens became zombies, and the city had headed for its
devastating fate. Humans were no match against zombies.
   In the chaos, Umbrella Europe applied a new type B.O.W., called
"Nemesis". The Nemesis would hunt down and destroy the surviving member
of S.T.A.R.S., Jill. It became imperative that our organization would
also obtain the Nemesis data.

 - September 29th -
   To cover up the whole affair, Umbrella jettisoned a Tyrant to take
care of Leon and Claire, who were trying to unveil their secrets.
   Then, a new revelation. Birkin used to hide the findings of his
studies in his daughter Sherry's pendant. It was very possible that the
G-virus was there. While Umbrella was busy with their cover up, we had
to capture Sherry before they did. I sent Ada undercover to seek the
location of Sherry. I, the "dead man" on the other hand, had to work in
the shadows.
   A spy's obligation and priority is in mission, to carry out the
mission like a machine without any emotional interference.
   But through her interaction and involvement with Leon Scott Kennedy,
there had been an affection growing insider her.
   My instincts sensed danger, something had to be done, quickly. My
instincts did not disappoint me. Even though Ada almost had her hands
on the G-virus, which Leon had acquired from Sherry, that affection of
her drove her to her death. But she was still of some use. I had to
save her life. My people hurried to retrieve the G-virus that Leon
threw away. But Hunk, the only survivor of Umbrella's salvage team, was
there before us.

 - September 30th -
   Our only option left was to bring back Birkin, the monster, as the
sample specimen and have him finish Leon and Claire in order to obtain
his combat data. Although Birkin lost the battle to Leon and Claire, we
succeeded in gathering samples of the G-virus from his dead body.

 - October 1st -
   In the morning the government bombed Raccoon city in an attempt to
stop for the viral outbreak. This was, of course, their feigned 
reason...
   Later, Claire left to Europe to find her lost brother Chris, and
Leon joined forces with an underground anti-Umbrella organization.
   Sherry is safe in our hands. I would never underestimate Birkin.
   There's something about this little girl...

  But all of you know that it answers you some unknown questions that
you always wonder. Let me give them in this short passage :

- The survivors of the mansion incident were Chris Redfield, Jill
Valentine, Barry Burton, Rebecca Champer and Brad Vickers.
- Chris is the character who directly killed Tyrant.
- Wesker was killed by Tyrant. But he had been infected the virus
before that makes him alive.
- Ada was saved by Wesker because he thought she's still useful for him. 
She stole the G-virus for him. 
- Sherry was caught by Wesker after Resident Evil 2 with the same 
reason.
- The official story of Resident Evil 2 is Leon A / Claire B.

  Okay, I have finished my work about this FAQs. I hope this guide will
help you to play the game better and have more fun. Guides are only
necessary when you are really stuck. To tell you the truth, playing a
game by yourself is better and funnier than playing completely with
guides. The games will be quickly forgotten because you know it so much
by the guides. That's my opinion. So I think everyone will sympathize
if my guide is still simple. They are all my decisions. But you can have 
ideas with my serious mistakes if I have. I thank you all of you about 
that. Please see my other guides also at Gamefaqs.
    There's one thing I want to tell you. Although I'm still a pupil who 
have to go to school, I would try to have a time for checking your 
emails about any problems in my guide. I have ever been a player who 
needs others' helps and I have been disappointed when they didn't reply 
my questions. So I understand how you think. Just contact me at my email 
address anything you want. I'll try to answer your problems and won't 
make you disappointed. But I won't answer any emails with bad purpose or 
hate emails. It's just a waste of time. But I'm willing to serve anyone 
who really need my help.
  Those guides are frequently updated as this one. Thanks for reading 
them ! Have a good time !
