3. Introduction                                                   X3000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	I picked up this game from my friend, who never plays any of 
the games he owns, and I loved it from the beginning.  I am quite a fan
of the RPG genre, a connoisseur per se, and can reasonably argue this 
game to have the finest storyline of any RPG I have played.  The 
sprites in the game take some time to become accustomed to, but I 
quickly found them to be a superior form of graphical display compared 
to...Final Fantasy 7(a great game).  Regardless, you should find this 
game highly enjoyable and entertaining (and worth however much money 
you did or did not spend on it).

	I strongly suggest talking to everyone in this game.  Because 
the story is the strongest aspect of this RPG, you will want all the 
information you can possibly receive.  You might hear some dumb, 
mundane things in these conversations, but even those can add 
atmosphere to a location, or personality to a character.  

	This FAQ will attempt to be relatively spoiler-free.  This may 
seem counter-intuitive, but what I mean is that I will not tell you 
what happens in a cutscene, fmv, or dialogue between any characters.  
Do not worry about spoiling some aspect of game's story in your use of
this walkthrough.  I will be intentionally ambiguous and vague as not 
to reveal too much.

	I also suggest not rushing this game.  The first disc took me 
about 60 hours to complete the first time.  Even on replays I doubt you
will finish it in less than 40 hours.  Needless to say, this game is 
long but very worth the time put into it.

	Treat this game like an extremely long, involved, and 
encompassing novel.  As such, you will want to absorb as much as you 
can initially, and then replay for finer details that you missed the 
first time due to a lack of knowledge.  

	I will occasionally put *NOTE*'s into the heart of the 
walkthrough.  These are mostly anecdotal information that some players
will find useful or interesting.  I will only tell you to talk to 
people that are necessary for the continuation of the game, but again I
suggest speaking to everyone possible.

Fei Fong Wong
=============

Birthplace: Unknown (It is known, but I'll let you figure it out)
       Age: 18
      Hair: Black
       Sex: Male
    Height: 5'7"
    Weight: 147 lbs.
 Specialty: Kenpo Karate
      Gear: Weltall, Weltall-2, Xenogears 
    Rating: 10/10


"Fei is a young man living in the rural village of Lahan. Due to an 
incident from his past, he is unable to recall events from his life 
prior to arriving in Lahan. An active young man, he enjoys teaching 
martial arts to the kids and villagers who think fondly of him. A 
gifted artist, Fei seemingly paints with a skill from someone else..."

	Fei is the protagonist of the game and the character you will 
use the most.  Luckily, he is a very strong character with devastating
physical capabilities and a powerful Gear.  His deathblows are 
impressive, and some of the later ones are ridiculously powerful.  His
ether, or chi, abilities are inane and mediocre at best.  However this
is of very little consequence because of his impressive physical 
capabilities.

	His gear is also very powerful albeit on the slow side.  Later
in the game the Weltall is upgraded _substantially_ and Fei will be the
strongest character in a gear in your entire party.  Fei is a great 
asset in or out of a gear.


Elhaym Van Houten
=================

Birthplace: Solaris
       Age: 18
      Hair: Reddish Orange
       Sex: Female
    Height: 5'6"
    Weight: 101 lbs.
 Specialty: Rods/Staves
      Gear: Vierge ('Virgin' in Latin), Regrs
    Rating: 10/10


"A Gebler officer assigned to a post in Aveh as a spy, she stole the 
latest model Gear from the Kislev Army. Caught in the act, she was 
chased down and forced to make an emergency landing in Lahan. Her 
encounter with Fei, who had no interest in conflicts and battles, 
changed her destiny."

	Elhaym (Elly) is, initially, a poor character in battle.  
However she is quickly able to defend herself and eradicate enemies.  
The first time she joins you, her physical abilities are lame but her 
ether abilities are constantly stellar.  Later in the game, her 
physical abilities improve drastically with her powerful deathblows, 
and her ether attacks continue to expand.

	Her gear, the Vierge, despite it's appearance, is a powerhouse.
With a few "Ether Doubler"'s and "Power Magic"'s she can annihilate 
scores of enemies with her -Aerods- ability.  The physical attacks of 
her gear are not wonderful, but not bad, and she has a nice speed.  Her
gear is, however, plagued with low defense, low fuel tank capacities, 
and weak weapons.  Despite this, her gear is still superior to many 
others and her character quickly becomes a powerful addition to any 
party.


Citan Uzuki
===========

Birthplace: Solaris
       Age: 29
      Hair: Black
       Sex: Male
    Height: 6'1"
    Weight: 150 lbs.
 Specialty: Martial Arts and Swords
      Gear: Heimdal (A Norse God), Fenrir
    Rating: 10/10


"He runs a clinic in the hills of Lahan. Known as a gentle doctor and 
advisor who likes to tinker with machines, his true identity and origin
from the Sacred Empire of Solaris are closely kept secrets. A wise man,
his abundant knowledge and tactics have saved Fei on many occasions."

	Citan is quite possibly the strongest character out of his 
gear.  His physical abilities are phenomenal and his ether abilities 
are very useful.  Additionally, when he joins your party, he starts 
with an insane 200 hp at level 5.  Even his deathblows are amazing and
probably have some of the most spectacular animations of any of them.

	His gear is not nearly as stellar as the character, but it 
isn't bad.  In all honesty, the Heimdal is just average in every 
aspect- except its strike animation, which shows very faint Japanese 
kana and kanji.  Other than that, nothing is particularly exceptional 
about this gear.  Use and overuse Citan in your party as a character, 
you will _not_ regret it.


Bartholomew Fatima
==================

Birthplace: Aveh (Fatima Castle)
       Age: 18
      Hair: Blonde
       Sex: Male
    Height: 6'1"
    Weight: 158 lbs.
 Specialty: Whips
      Gear: Brigandier, Andvari
    Rating: 7/10


"While seemingly the leader of a group of desert pirates and captain of
the submarine Yggdrasil, he is in reality, the prince of the Fatima 
Dynasty in Aveh. A brash and hot-tempered young man, his impulsiveness
has gotten his friends into trouble more than once."

	Bartholomew (Bart) is a relatively useless character in the 
presence of Fei, Elly or Citan.  His physical attacks are above-average
and some consider his status affect ether magic to be useful.  I did 
not find him useful in any respect, except to take damage or heal 
someone.

	The Brigandier is pretty much as useless as Bart.  Don't use 
this thing unless you are forced to use it.  The same advice follows 
for Bart: avoid using him.  I will say that this gear becomes more 
useful if you know more of Bart's deathblows- but that means you have 
to use Bart, and I don't recommend going to that extreme early in the 
game.


Billy Lee Black
===============

Birthplace: Mass Island Sea Area (Aquvy Islands)
       Age: 16
      Hair: Off-white
       Sex: Male
    Height: 5'7"
    Weight: 130 lbs.
 Specialty: Handguns, Ether Guns, Shotguns
      Gear: Renmazuo, Omnigear Renmazuo
    Rating: 8/10


"Seemingly abandoned by his father, and with his mother dead after a 
reaper attack, Billy turned to religion for stability. At the 
suggestion of his mentor Bishop Stone, he became an Etone, or fighting
priest to combat the reapers. At the same time, he has devoted himself
to raising his little sister Primera, who hasn't spoken since their 
mother's death."

	Billy is a surprisingly useful character.  His attacks are 
powerful with the right ammunition and his ether abilities are 
unparalleled for healing and support.  His deathblows are relatively 
powerful as well.  Billy also comes equipped with some very useful 
items when he joins your party, so take advantage of that.

	Billy's gear is an avatar of his character in every respect.  
In other words, the Renmazuo is an all-around good gear and a good 
replacement for Citan or someone when they are unavailable.  Use Billy
in place of one of your other powerful characters or as a main 
character.


Rico Banderas
=============

Birthplace: Kislev
       Age: 30
      Hair: Orange
       Sex: Male
    Height: 7'0"
    Weight: 352 lbs.
 Specialty: Wrestling/Being Useless
      Gear: Stier, Omnigear Stier
    Rating: 1/10


"Created as an experiment, Rico is a muscular being that is half-man, 
half-monster. A champion of the Battling Arena in the capital of 
Kislev, he is also a prisoner of D Block, though his battle prowess has
ensured that he live better than most."

	Rico is the most useless character in the entire game.  The 
irony lies in his immense strength the first time you fight him 
(dealing circa 1200 damage to Fei) and after joining your party he 
deals a measily few hundred--if that.  Pathetic.

	Some people claim that the Stier is an excellent gear due to 
it's high defense, offense, and low fuel consumption.  This does not 
make up for its pitiful speed and overall stupidity.  It sucks.  I'm 
predisposed against it, so use it if you want, but I hated that piece 
of trash.  Do not use Rico.  Do not use Rico.  Do not use Rico.


Maria Balthazar
================

Birthplace: Solaris
       Age: 13
      Hair: Sable Silver
       Sex: Female
    Height: 4'8"
    Weight: 90 lbs.
 Specialty: Martial Arts
      Gear: Seibzehn
    Rating: 6/10 


	Maria, at the tender age of 13, is the sole protector of Shevat
during the time of Fei's visit there.  She is a distraught yet brave 
girl who believes in her kidnapped and supposedly deceased father.

	Maria is even more useless than Rico in character combat. Her 
gear, on the other hand, is immensely powerful.  The huge disadvantage
to her is her inability to learn or use deathblows, but her gear 
all ready has special attacks like deathblows.  The Seibzehn has a 
titanic defense and offense, but poor speed.  This won't matter in the
long run because of its high hp and endurance--it will annihilate 
enemies.  Use Seibzehn, but don't rely on Maria as a character.


Emeralda Kasim
==============

Birthplace: Zeboim Civilization
       Age: ~4000 (Appearance of a child and later of a young woman)
      Hair: Emerald
       Sex: Female
    Height: 5'5"
    Weight: 110 lbs.
 Specialty: Martial Arts of a type
      Gear: Crescens
    Rating: 9/10


	Emeralda is one of the more enigmatic characters.  Even her 
discovery by Fei is troubled by Krelian's subordinates.  Oddly enough,
Emeralda recognizes Fei somehow, but calls him by a different name. 
Emeralda is an amalgamate of trillions of nanomachines that can 
perpetually repair and rebuild her. 

	Emeralda is an incredibly potent character in or out of a gear.
Her physical attacks are very powerful and her stat boosts at levels 
are stellar when she becomes an adult.  Her ether attacks are deadly, 
tantamount to Elly's, maybe a little weaker or stronger, depending on 
levels.

	The Crescens is the fastest gear in the entire game that you 
can control.  With some ether amplification and power boosts, she can 
solo bosses and multitudes of enemies.  Emeralda is power, power, power
--use her whenever you need a powerful fighter in your party.



Chu-Chu
=======

Birthplace: Shevat
       Age: 1.25 yrs
      Hair: Pink
       Sex: Female
    Height: 2'11"
    Weight: 77 lbs.
 Specialty: Brawling
      Gear: Enlarged Self
    Rating: 2/10


	Chu-Chu is one of the rare species of Chu Chu.  As such, she is
horrible at fighting unless you level her immensely.  You will have to
go out of your way to make her useful.  I suggest leaving her be at all
times.

Instructions:
-------------

	You will arrive in this house after the introduction and 
various cutscenes.  Note that you can look at the paintings in your 
room if you so choose.  Go ahead and do the obligatory bed check to 
receive 200 gold.  Leave this room and head WEST to the room there.  
In a corner of the room, near the door, there is a spider web.  Jump up
to it to get it.  Each of the barrels in this room contains an Aquasol.
Leave this room and go to the last unexplored room on this floor.  Talk
to the maid if you want information on Fei's history.  Go up the 
stairs.

	Once upstairs, talk to Timothy[in the blue shirt] for a short
scene.  Attempt to leave the house and after the conversation, go 
outside.  Explore the town, check out the store if you want, just 
explore and get a feel for it.

|	I advise against buying tents in this game.     |
|Omegasols are the same as tents in their effectiveness |
|and cost, yet they can be used at any time[outside of  |
|battle], unlike tents which are only available for use |
|at save points.                                        |
|_______________________________________________________|

	Head back toward your house and go behind it to the field with
the man on it.  Talk to man enough times to receive two Aquasols.  Go 
SOUTH of this house to another one.  This is the newbie area where you
can learn about the game.  Spend some time here and learn everything.
Even Lucca[Chrono Trigger/Cross] is here, but if you talk to her and 
listen to what she has to say, it will cost you some money.  Talk to 
the bald man about deathblows and receive 80 gold.  Head EAST to 
another house.

	This house holds within it the Rock-Paper-Scissors champion of
Lahan[that's not very impressive, but still].  Frankly, this game is 
frustrating and tedious to win and yields a very small prize much later
in the game.  It's up to you to challenge this guy but do so at your 
own discretion, it'll cost 50 gold per game if you lose, +50 if you 
win.  Look at the very good RPS guide by KMadoushi for information 
regarding this game.  Go downstairs and talk to the old woman.  Say 
that you like it[Lahan] and she will give you 120 gold.  Leave this 
floor and this house.

	You will see a well in the center of the town.  Jump in it 
repeatedly and ignore Fei's ominous premonitions.  Keep jumping into it
until you receive an Eyeball[something weird], a Power Ring, and an 
Aquasol S.  Now talk to the woman next to the well and tell her that 
her thoughts are not that strange to receive a fifth Aquasol. 

	Next, talk to Dan if you haven't already[Tell him whatever you
want, it has no effect on the game, but if you agree he will like you 
more], and go to the bar NORTH of the house with the women standing in
front of it[Alice's house].  Once in the bar, talk to the man in the 
blue coat and tell him that drinking doesn't solve anything to receive
a Mermaid Tear.  You will not use this until disc 2 so be patient.  
Head back SOUTH to Alice's house and talk to the woman in front of it 
to be let inside.  Go upstairs and talk to Alice.

	I suggest leveling by leaving town and walking around into some
random battles.  A safe level to reach before attempting the Mountain 
Trail is around 4.  Additionally, the enemies around Lahan will 
sometimes drop Fencing equipment.  This is superior to martial 
equipment and if you have excess, can be sold for a decent price.  
Remember to go back into Lahan and sleep in your bed if you need to 
heal yourself.

	There is a save point NORTH of the entrance and a split path.
If you go NORTH, you can see the path from an aerial perspective and 
receive -(an Aquasol on the ledge EAST of the tree)-.  Back at the save
point there is a large rock with a tree on it.  A small path leads up 
to the tree and if you jump into the tree you will find a bird's egg.
You can choose to take it or leave it alone.  If you take it, the 
mother bird will hound you and peck you for damage.  Once you reach the
Doctor's house, Yui will cook it for you and you will gain weight.

	Take the WEST path and follow it until you see a boy.  Talk to
him to learn about power jumps.  Jump over the gap to the other side 
and cross the bridge up ahead.  -(Underneath the bridge is an Aquasol)-
.  Not far from the bridge is a tree next to a big rock and signpost.
Jump up into the tree to find a Spider and examine it to receive it.  
This will be useful much later in the game.  Go NORTH to Citan Uzuki's
residence.

	Don't enter the house immediately.  First, go up the stairs of
the house and open a door to the SOUTH.  A chicken will appear in the 
room and there is an Aquasol in said room.  Go upstairs and into the 
door here.  Climb the ladder in this room to appear next to a 
telescope on the roof.  Examine it if you want, but jump near the 
smokestack and examine it for 120 gold.

	Go back downstairs to the ground and go to the EAST side of the
house.  Jump behind the flowerbed here, turn around and examine it to 
receive Midori's Ring.  This is a special item that is used much later
in the game and will not appear in any list in your menu or inventory. 
Enter the house.

	Once inside, talk to Yui and Midori.  Leave the house and enter
the shack behind it to meet with Citan.  You will be back inside and 
Yui will cook the egg, if you brought it, for you and there will be a 
scene.  Afterwards, go back inside and examine the yellow box for yet 
another cutscene.  Leave Citan's house and this area.

	Back at the mountain path, progress over the bridge for a 
scene.  Head back to Lahan with Citan.

|	I strongly suggest learning deathblows whenever |
|possible.  This isn't to say that you have to max them |
|all now, but learn a few now and gradually learn more  |
|as you progress in the story.  The first time through  |
|I didn't pay much attention to deathblows and boss     |
|fights were tougher than they had to be.  Later in the |
|game, you will receive a WizardryRing which boosts the |
|deathblow learn rate of a character.  Don't wait until |
|you get this item to learn all your deathblows (like I |
|did the first time).                                   |
|_______________________________________________________|


	As soon as you arrive, move forward for a very short scene.  
The forest can be quite confusing as the textures are indistinguishable
at times.  To combat this, keep your bearings straight.

	Face SOUTH and hug the left wall and look for a fairly large 
rock that is next to a large, overturned tree trunk.  Jump up and on to
the tree and walk until you see another tree trunk on the ground.  Jump
down to the SOUTHWEST to receive an Aquasol.  Walk toward the Hob-gob 
you see near the tree roots.  It will jump upwards and leave when you 
near it- so follow it.  When you catch up to it at the top, you will 
fight it.

	Save if need be and continue along the path until you see a 
Hob-gob in front of a large boulder.  Fight the Hob-gob, but be 
careful, as soon as you defeat it, the boulder it was holding will 
tumble down the log.  Jump to the ledge to your left, the one from 
which you lept to the log.  Once the boulder has passed, go to the new
area and a scene takes place.

	Notice that you can obtain Hob-Steaks by killing Hob-gobs with
Elly's fire ether spells.  Hob-Steaks heal 150 hp compared to 
Hob-Jerky's 50 hp.  They can also be sold for quite a price.

	Head SOUTHEAST until you see a signpost and a path up.  Follow
the path to yet another signpost.  Take the SOUTH path to see three 
Hob-gobs back away from you; follow the one that went SOUTHWEST, fight
it and get the Arcane Rod.  Jump SOUTHEAST for an Aquasol.  Head back 
to where the Hob-gobs were and go the one that went SOUTH.  Fight it 
and jump down near the save point and SurvivalTent.

	There is a big slab of rock up ahead.  Going to it will trigger
a scene, but de-equip Elly of her accessories before you approach it 
because she will leave soon.  She'll have new equipment the next time 
you see her anyway.

	Walk to the slab to initiate a fight and a subsequent scene.  
Follow the path Elly took, the one heading SOUTHWEST, and prepare for a
battle.  The first part of the battle will be with Fei as a character.
Just hit the dragon for 5 or so rounds.

scene.  Go back NORTH until you see a buggy.  Walk to it to inspire 
Citan to formulate an idea.    

	Go into the rental shop, but buy anything you need to and save
before you do.  You can go into the bar to see a scene with Big Joe, 
who you will see many many times in the game (kind of like Ultros...).

	Once in the rental shop, speak to the clerk behind the desk to
rent the buggy outside.  Once Citan leaves, follow him and exit the 
town (save if you need/want to).  When you arrive on the World Map, 
head WEST to look for Citan.

of your way.  Get the Gold Nugget on they way and continue SOUTHWEST 
into a tunnel.  Follow this long tunnel to another room.

	Continue along the path until you see a Gear.  Talk to the 
Gear for some information about your environs.  Go WEST for now and 
jump on the ledges you will see.  Keep jumping until you receive the 
IronGWhip (A Gear whip for Brigandier).  You will also see a red sensor
which you cannot manipulate yet, but remember this location.  Go back 
to the informative Gear and take the SOUTH path.

	The camera will pan to a house.  Go to the house.  Inside you 
will meet Ol' Man Bal.  After the scene, talk to him again to learn 
about Gears, the sensors, and to buy Gear/character parts.  Buy the 
best he has to offer.  I also recommend leveling your characters until
they can use 6 AP deathblows(~Level 22) as there is a difficult boss 
fight at the end of the cavern.  You can level them after finding both
sensors, however, so don't worry about it too much for now.  If you 
don't know anything about Gears, go the _Gears_ section of this FAQ.
When you're done, exit the house and head NORTH.  

	Jump up to the land bridge and follow the tunnel to a sensor.
Examine the sensor to disengage it.  Return to the previous area and 
then head back to the informative Gear.  Take the WEST path to the 
other sensor and disengage that.  Head back to Balthazar.

	Talk to Balthazar to open the barrier and to initiate a scene.
After that, level as necessary and exit through the newly opened 
barrier.

	Continue SOUTH until you see a gondola and an elevator.  Leave
your Gears and use the gondola to get the other side on which there is
a power generator.  Activate the generator and use the gondola to get
back to the original platform.  Get on and use the elevator.

	In the next area, jump into the canyon and back up on the SOUTH
side.  Use the elevator here.

	Be prepared for a difficult boss battle.  You will notice a 
gigantic Gear flying around.  Jump down and go forward for it to attack
you.

Enemies:
--------

Instructions:
-------------

	Become accustomed to the layout and design of the Yggdrasil 
because you will see this thing quite frequently.  Note the small 
building to the far NORTH.  This houses the Yggdrasil's Gearshop.  You
can upgrade, repair, and maintain your Gears there.  You can also go 
the space behind each Gear (on the catwalk) and speak to a mechanic 
about the Gear.  After the initial scenes, head to the NORTH side of 
the docking bay to a door.  

	In the next room, you will see a long hallway with 6 doors.  
The first EAST leads to a vacant room that will be important far later.
The first AND second WEST(s) lead(s) to the quarters for the crew.  The
second EAST leads to the infirmary.

	You can weigh yourself in the infirmary, rest in the quarters,
and do nothing in the vacant room.

	The room on the NORTH side of the hall is the Meeting Room.  
Maison is here and will sell you items and accessories.  Downstairs 
from here are two vacant rooms (one is very special much later), and a
passageway to the Engine Room.  Head back into the hallway.

	Take the only remaining door, the one cushioned away in a 
corner.  This one is an elevator that takes you to another room.  On 
this upper level, you can use the ladder to exit the Yggdrasil, or take
the door with the insignia on it to go to the Bridge.  Head to the 
bridge and talk to Sigurd (white haired) to advance the game.


=======================================================================
========================== - Bart's Hideout - ====================X5111
=======================================================================

Level:
------
  Fei: 22
Citan: 18

Items:
------
Iron Whip

Enemies:

Neo Tin Robo	1110	800	Extra Ar, Extra Ar+1
Sand Man	60	50	---
Sand Shark	121	111	---
Sand Trooper	1050	500	C Circuit+1
Trooper		250	800	Extra Ar

Instructions:
-------------

	After the scenes, follow Maison to the upper level.  This is 
the main floor.  The door to the SOUTH, with the note attached, is 
Bart's room.  Go in there for an Iron Whip.  The EAST door leads to the
Planning Room.  The WEST hall leads to the World Map.  Follow Citan and
Maison to the residential dining hall.

	Once the scenes are over, talk to the little girl near the exit
of the room for a scene.  Talk to her father for another scene.  The 
woman behind the counter will sell you items/accessories/Gear parts, 
they are, however, inferior to what is available on the Yggdrasil.  
Follow Citan and Bart to the planning room for another scene.  After 
you see the children go down to the lower level, go into Bart's room.

	In Bart's room, grab the Iron Whip if you haven't.  Now, try to
leave the room.  Head down to the Yggdrasil.  When Bart asks to speak 
with you, respond with "Sure" for another scene.  Leave the room and 
walk past the elevator to the catwalk and follow it to the Hangar Bay.

	Jump up to the catwalk next to Weltall and talk to the man in 
front of the Gear for a scene.  Head to the sleeping area.

	Talk to the man in the brown coat/jacket and rest.  After even
more scenes, head back to the elevator and go down.  Another scene and
a Gear Battle will ensue.  Be prepared for a series of Battles, none of
which are particularly difficult.

	Scenes ensue after you defeat everyone.  Once you regain 
control, head to the Bridge on the Yggdrasil.  Talk to Sigurd to leave
the Hideout.  Finally, you can control the Yggdrasil.  

	The next destination is Bledavik, the capital of Aveh.  It is 
located SOUTHEAST of the Bart's Hideout.  It is an isolated city in the
middle of the desert and is also situated on top of a mountain.

Trooper		250	800	Extra Ar

Instructions:
-------------

	This is one of my favorite areas in the game.  It is one of the
most plot-enriching places in the beginning as well.

	When you enter Bledavik, scenes will start immediately.  When 
you are able, walk into the marketplace and a woman will talk to you.
Tell her you do not have a hotel room so that she will show you where 
the hotel is(there is only one you can go to anyway).

	Head into the hotel.  Talk to the man behind the counter and 
tell him "you have a recommendation".  This will lower the price.  
Don't stay unless you're hurt badly and instead, go upstairs and talk 
to the nun.  Head back into the city.

	East of the marketplace are two sets of stairs.  Go up them and
behind the armor shop to find an old man and woman.  Talk to the man, 
it'll help later.  Go back to the market.

	Explore the marketplace.  There are various produce items to 
buy, and you can usually haggle with the merchants by saying "Don't 
buy".  Notably, there is a woman, in the northen side of the 
marketplace, that will buy Fangs, Eyeballs, and Scales for higher 
amounts of Gold than normal.

	While you explore, you might see a scene in which two kids 
steal from a merchant.  Follow the kids through the passageway (this is
where the hide-and-seek kid is as well) and talk to them.  If you give
them 1000 Gold, they will pay you back in disc 2.  Actually, they will
give you 100 Gold everytime you leave the screen and talk to them 
again.  This isn't much by then, but it is still funny.
 
	Southwest from this stall is a passageway inbetween two other 
stalls.  In there is a boy with whom you can play hide-and-seek.  Talk 
to him and the leave the room and go back so the kid will hide.  Now 
you have to find him four times.  Make sure to talk to the old man and
try to open the grate next to him before you find him all four times.
I recommend talking to him after finding the kid twice.

  #   Location
  -   --------
  1   North side of the market.  Behind an archway.
  2   Next to the hotel and Ethos Workshop.  Behind some barrels.
  3   North of the hotel.  Next to the building with a Mario's sign.
  4   Near the SOUTH exit/entrance.  He is in a corner on the eastern
      side.  The camera does not help, so mash X until you find him.

	Once you find him, he will hand over the H&S Badge.  If you 
talked to the old man, the kid will tell you about his experiences in 
the waterways.  He will also mention that the old man has the key.  Go
talk to the old man.

	When you talk to him, tell him that you will "Rescue Margie".
He will hand over the "Well Key" item.  Exit the market through the 
NORTHern exit to reach Shakhan Square.


                          - Shakhan Square -
			    ==============
	
	This area is interesting.  Talk to the man WEST of the 
entrance to buy a miniGear.  Now talk to the bird-boy near the stall 
twice.  If you give him the miniGear, he will tell you how to get a 
Gold Nugget later.

	You can learn to breathe fire from the girl who breathes red 
fire.  There are also cakes to buy: the spiced cakes make you gain 
weight and the iced cakes make you lose weight.

	Head to the northern exit (explore first).


                           - Fatima Castle -
			     =============

	As you enter, a scene will take place.  Like I said before: Do
what Citan says.  Head toward one of the booths and register for the 
tournament.  Pick any name you want, it won't affect anything. Head 
back to the Marketplace.


                              - Bledavik -
				========

	Go to the hotel and talk to the nun upstairs.  After a scene, 
Fei will be the only member of the party.  You can now go to all the 
amusement events in Shakhan square.  When you're ready, talk to 
Bart/Citan and choose to rest to begin the plan.

	After he is defeated, the menu will appear.  Use an Omegasol or
such on Fei and cancel out to switch back to Bart.


                        - Underground Waterways -
			  =====================

	Note that the time you have as Bart is determined by the amount
of time Fei spent defeating the last opponent.

	Get off the ladder and start swimming (use the 'O' button to 
swim rapidly).  Head up the tunnel, and ignore the SOUTHEAST path at 
the split.  Watch for a pipe in the upcoming tunnel.  Climb up it for 
the aforementioned Gold Nugget.  Return to the tunnel and continue 
upstream.

	Occasionally the water current will strengthen, but just go 
against it despite the fact that you won't move much.  These bursts of
water are due to the water gates opening.  They are only temporary.

	You will face another split.  -(Take the SOUTHEAST path for a 
Rosesol S.  Go back NORTHWEST)-.  Take the northern path.

	After an upwards slope, the tunnel will split again.  -(Head 
NORTHEAST and follow it to a split.  Take the SOUTHEAST split for a 
SurvivalTent.  Head back NORTHWEST, WEST, NORTHWEST, SOUTH, and 
SOUTHWEST to the first split)-.  Take the NORTHWEST path.

	Fei might have his next fight now.  If not, that's ok, you'll 
have it later so don't worry.  He also might have it earlier, which is
fine if you stall a little in some other fights.

			 =====================

	Yet another bifurcation.  -(Take the SOUTHWEST path for an 
Aquasol S, and head back)-.  Head NORTH to the final splintering.

	The southern path takes you to Shakhan Square, the southeastern
path leads to a dead end, and the northern path leads to the Castle. 
Take the northern path.

                           - Fatima Castle -
			     =============
	
	At the Castle, head EAST to the ladder and climb up it.  Talk 
to the old man for a nostalgic scene and climb up the ladder in the 
SOUTHEAST corner.  You should now be in the center of a courtyard.

	Soldiers will chase you if they see you and they are rather 
quick.  If they catch up to you, you will have to fight them.

after defeating two guards.

the strongest Whip, it inflicts poison which is a powerful asset in 
Boss fights).  The second room is empty.  The third room contains 4

Grab them from the ceiling above the stove.  The second and third doors
lead to the same room- the cafeteria.  The cafeteria has nothing of 
value in it, unless you simply want to see it.  Head back to the 
archway.

	Go through the door to the SOUTH.  This room has two staircases
going to the upper level.  Go upstairs and through the double doors to
the NORTH.  Turn EAST and go down the path.   The first room is empty.
The second room has many guards in it.  The third room has an Aquasol S
within it.  Head back to the double doors.

	Head downstairs and notice the pink, stuffed toy of Margie's in
front of the bridge door.  Examine the toy and go the vacant room on 
the lower level.  This is now Margie's Room, and once you're there, 
talk to Margie.  Talk to Chu-Chu again if you have a spider in your 
inventory because she will trade you for an Ether Veiler.

	Head back to the bridge and talk to Sigurd for a scene, and 
talk to him again for directions to Nisan.  Navigate the Yggdrasil 
NORTHWEST until you see a lone, isolated tree.  Go within a proximity 
of it to find the road to Nisan.

|     At this point in the game, I have learned all the |
|deathblows for Fei, Bart, and Citan.  This does not    |
|include hyper-deathblows.  If you don't at least have  |
|one or two six AP deathblows learned, do so now.       |
|_______________________________________________________|

	After a few scenes you will regain control with Citan in your 
party.  Enter Nisan.

	An item shop is NORTHWEST of the first set of stairs you 
encounter.  You might notice that some of the items here are 
atrociously expensive.  These are one-time only items, meaning that you
will never be able to purchase them again during the course of the game
from any shop or location.  Refer to the -Items- section to find out 
what these items do, and if you find that one is worth the price you 
can do whatever you need to.  A man from the Yggdrasil is also here to
sell you Gear parts.

	When you're done, head NORTHEAST to the group of nuns.  Talk to
the woman here to take Margie to the Nisan Monastery.  There will be a
scene and you will end up in the cathedral.

                          - Nisan Monastery -
			    ===============

	When you arrive there will be a short scene.  Follow Margie 
around the cathedral and feel free to explore it.  The cathedral is 
amazingly well-rendered for the time, which surprised me the first time
I saw it.  You will eventually end up in the "Room of Sophia" for more
scenes.

	After the last scene, head to the second floor and go to the 
door on the WEST side.  Enter the door and talk to Sister Agnes for 
additional information.  Leave the cathedral and go back to Nisan.  

                               - Nisan -
				 =====

	Talk to Maison when you are there.  When you have the option to
choose questions that Bart will ask; ask all of them.  Say you 
understand to end the conversation.  Each answer is pretty lengthy and
plot-intensive.

	Bart will leave after you finish asking questions.  Follow Bart
outside to the archway past the Item shop.  Talk to him for a scene.  
After that, head to the building to the NORTHWEST of the Item Shop. 
More scenes will ensue.  By the time these a over, it'll be a new 
day(in the game).  When prepared, talk to Bart to continue.

                           - The Yggdrasil -
			     =============

	As Citan, talk to Maison then go up the elevator then the 
ladder to the deck of the Yggdrasil.  More and more scenes.  Finally, 
you will end up in the Kislev Mountains.

Instructions:
-------------

	When you first arrive, the camera will show the entrance to the
cave.  That is your goal for now.  Before you go there, however, head 
SOUTHEAST to find a MagneticCoat and Extra Ar+2.  Note that enemy 
encounters are very frequent here.  Take advantage of this and level-up
to level 30 or so.

	Inside the cave go NORTHWEST and get the Rosesol S and Gold 
Nugget on the way.  Eventually, you will see a Gear next to the exit.
Talk to it and choose to trust it, otherwise you can't refuel/repair 
and you have to fight it.  Before you exit, level and equip a Beam Coat
if you want to live through the next few battles.  Many of the upcoming
boss fights are somewhat hard, and a few use Beam weapons.

	The upcoming fights are not individually difficult, but they 
are contiguous.  In other words, you won't have an oppurtunity to heal
inbetween fights, which makes efficient fuel consumption critical.

Instructions:
-------------

	After some scenes, Fei will devise a headstrong approach to 
advancing on the border fleet.  I suggest using the following setup on
the Weltall:
	Extra Ar+3 |OR| A/C |OR| C Circuit |OR| C Circuit+1
	Beam Coat
	MagneticCoat

	Some bosses in the near future will use Beam attacks, and 
because you are in the desert, it might be useful to have normal 
agility, but if you want armor instead, that is fine.  

	Begin WEST and avoid all obstacles, such as gunfire [-1 HP] and
air mines [-15 HP].  Avoid Gears unless you want to fight them.  Do try
to conserve HP and Fuel for the boss battles ahead.  Keep going WEST to
another screen and a scene.  Head WEST again, more scenes ensue and 
then a battle.

It is better that you do, however, as you'll receive a higher Prison

it will do nothing.

Head back to where Hammer was for another scene.  Head back to the 
Infirmary when you can for another scene.

	At this point, you can choose to have your collar removed, 
resulting in a random outcome.  I would choose to rest, wake up, then 
have Citan remove the collar.  This will sometimes result in you 
gaining 5000 gold.  Eventually you will regain control of Fei in the 
infirmary.  Go upstairs for another scene, then to the NORTHWEST part

|     The enemies in the Sewer are very tough.  This is |

| support items.  Level immensely while you can, but be |
| careful in this area.  It is also very easy to become |

| you might find yourself going in circles which is     |
| especially dangerous in the later Sewer sections.     |
|_______________________________________________________|


	*Watch out for the water pouring from the pipes here, they hurt
you for 3 damage.  Make sure you buy at least 25 Zetasol and have at 
least 10 before attempting the final boss of this area.*

	Head WEST while avoiding the water.  You cannot fall into the 
stream here, so don't worry about that.  Follow the path SOUTH then 
SOUTHEAST for a Physisol.

	There should be a bridge here, cross it.  Head SOUTH to the 
murder scene for a cutscene.  After the scene, follow the path NORTH, 
then NORTHWEST, then WEST to a ladder that leads to section 2-A of the
Sewer.  Don't use the ladder yet.

	Cross the bridge to the EAST of the ladder, and then head WEST
for the Kislev Map.  Go back EAST, SOUTHEAST, EAST, then NORTH to 
another murder scene and another dialogue.

	Now, head SOUTH then EAST to an Aquasol S.  Go back to the 
ladder that leads to Section 2-A.  It should be WEST, WEST, NORTHWEST,
and across the Bridge.


                    - Nortune Sewers: Section 2-A -
		      ===========================

	Another scene will greet you upon your arrival here.  After the
scene, follow the path SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, EAST, and NORTHEAST for a pair
of Cool Shades.

	The ladder across from the Cool Shades leads to Secion 2-B, do
NOT go there yet.

	Head back to the bridge nearest the ladder from which you came
to section 2-A.  Cross the bridge, head NORTH then NORTHWEST.  Now you
have to avoid the rotating blades here as well (5 damage). 

	Keep going NORTHWEST, WEST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, and SOUTH.  Cross
the bridge here.  Head NORTH, NORTHEAST, NORTH, then WEST and you'll 
see an odd contraption on the floor.  Examine the machine once for a 
scene, and then again to find the Sewer Keys and another scene.

	Afterwards, head EAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, and SOUTH.  Cross the
bridge.  Cross the next bridge you see.  Head NORTHWEST, WEST, 
NORTHWEST, and NORTH for a Poison Guard.  Go back SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, 
EAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, EAST, and SOUTHEAST to a door.  Go through
the door to the Sewers: Section 2-B.


                    - Nortune Sewers: Section 2-B -
		      ===========================

	Go SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, EAST, NORTHEAST, NORTH and cross the
bridge.  Then head NORTH, NORTHWEST, and WEST for a Gallant Belt.  The
ladder across from the belt leads all the way back to section 1.

	Now, go back EAST, SOUTHEAST, and SOUTH.  Cross the bridge(1) 
here.  Head SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, WEST, and across another bridge(2).  Now
go WEST, SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, EAST and cross another bridge(3).  Head WEST
and NORTHWEST to a ladder that goes back to section 2-A.  Ignore the 
ladder.

	Go NORTHWEST, then NORTH for a scene.  Take the door to the 
NORTWEST back to section 2-A.

	Continue on the path to a Knight Helm.  Go back through the 
door.  Head SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, EAST and across a bridge(4).
Head EAST, NORTH, NORTHWEST, and across another bridge(5).  Go EAST, 
NORTHEAST, NORTH, and another bridge(6) that needs to be crossed.  Go 
SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, and SOUTH.  Talk to the small green 
creature here.

	Turn and go EAST and follow the path until you hit a scene and
a Gold Nugget.  Go back to the bridge next to Gramps and cross it.

	First, head WEST and SOUTH to a Zetasol DX.  Go NORTH, EAST, 
SOUTHEAST and across a bridge(7).  Go SOUTHEAST then SOUTH to find a 
Mentsol.

	Now, go NORTH, NORTHWEST, NORTH, NORTHEAST, NORTH, NORTHEAST, 
and EAST to a door.  Attempt to open the door for a scene.  Rico will 
ask if you are ready and reply, "Of course" to go through the door.

	There will be a scene inside the room.  Be sure to get the Bell
Amulet in the chest as well as the Ether Veiler.  The Ether Veiler is 
higher on the pipes and you will have to jump up to it to obtain it.  
Go back outside.  Go WEST then SOUTHWEST for one more scene.  

	*This is the time to cram experience and level as much as you 
can.  The boss fight ahead is a tough one.  I suggest you level Rico 
and Citan to at least level 30 if not 35-40.  At around 40, the boss 
will not be hard at all, but it does take quite some time to reach such
a high level at this point.  As always, learn deathblows, especially 
for Citan and Rico.  Also, stock up on Zetasols for this fight.*
	
	When you are ready, go to Gramps.  Head NORTH, NORTHWEST, 
NORTHEAST, NORTH, then NORTHWEST to find a drain and sluge around it.
Examine the drain for a scene and battle.

]							    [
]     Redrum has five basic attacks that he will use:	    [
] 1) Gel attack inflicting the Confusion status		    [
] 2) Attack inflicting the Poison status		    [
] 3) Normal attack (physical)				    [
] 4) 'Bloody Rain' - Fire based attack that hits all and    [

] 5) 'Murder' - Drains a character of ALL HP, killing 	    [
]	them and healing Redrum.                            [
]							    [
]     You can either use deathblows every turn, which is    [
] quite effective, or save up 28 AP on at least two charac- [
] ters and unleash two very powerful combos.  In either     [
] case, have Rico cast 'Steel Fist' on himself and Fei cast [
] 'Iron Valor' on himself.  This will generally boost most  [
] deathblows by ~50% damage wise.			    [
]							    [
]     If Redrum's 'Bloody Rain' is giving you a hard time,  [
] then have Citan cast 'Renki' on himself then on the next  [
] turn cast 'Suiseii' to block fire damage, which will nul- [
] lify fire damage done to you.				    [
]							    [
]     Remember to revive fallen members and not to use Fire [
] based attacks, like Rico's Fire Bomb deathblow, on Redrum [
] as he absorbs Fire elements.				    [

	After you finally defeat Redrum, there will be a sequence and 
you will appear back at the Sewer entrance.  Go back to the infirmary
and rest.  Now go to the Battling Arena to continue with the 
tournament.


                          - Battling Arena -

	Talk to the girl when you are ready to begin the fourth day's 
bouts.

Hatamoto
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hatamoto loves combos, and he has quite powerful ones too.  
Don't stay too close to him for very long or you might die quickly.  He
has no notable weaknesses so a single strategy won't be too effective.
Mix your attacks and you should be fine, but he does block often.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Firewheel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	How Firewheel ever got past Hatamoto I will never understand.
This guy is pathetically easy, he almost never blocks attacks.  He is 
rather strong, however, but while he runs around frantically, pound him
with Ether Bullets.  He also has a high recover rate from falling and 
is pretty fast.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Silver Star
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	I love Silver Star's paint job.  He is fast and has great 
range, but no power behind his hits.  Run up to him and pound him 
relentlessly and you will win with no trouble.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


	There will be a short sequence with Hammer after you win the 
Semi-Finals.  Save and leave this area.  More scenes ensue, and then a
fight...

       A scene follows the fight.  Eventually, you'll end up in the 
infirmary again.  Head back to the Battling Arena to fight Rico.

Stier
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Despite it's size, the Stier is pretty nimble and quick when it
needs to be.  It uses attacks, combos, and ether attacks well, so be 
careful.  Surprisingly, he isn't that hard, but you will have to fight
him 3 times, not just the normal 2. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	After you win, there will be a number of sequences.  


                          - Nortune D Block -
			    ===============

	Afterwards, you'll end up in the Champ's room, now your room.
Head downstairs and attempt to leave the bar.  The bartender will talk
with you, then leave.

	Attempt to leave D Block and the Guard will stop you for a 
short scene.  I recommend leveling Fei and learning deathblows for a 
little bit.  Now that you are of Rank S, you have freedom to move 
throughout Kislev.  Exit D Block when you're done.


                          - Nortune A Block -
			    ===============

	Head to the SOUTHEAST part of Nortune to A Block.  On the EAST
side, you will find Big Joe.  Talk with him for a scene.  If you pay 
him 5000 Gold, he'll let you see what's in the alley behind him, which
is nothing for now.  However, if you come here later in the game there
will be something there.

	In the SOUTHern part of the Block are the stores with Items and
Accessories.  Stock up as necessary and leave this Block.

	Head to the middle of Nortune, the Central District.

Items:
------
MomentoChain
Insulated Ar
Knight Mail
Power Magic

Enemies:
--------
 ---

Instructions:
-------------

	Talk to the two soldiers you see for a scene.  Go EAST and 
through the door and then downstairs to another door.  Go through it 
and go WEST and through the double doors.

	Walk across this room and jump on the box and then on to the 
shelf.  Get the Insulated Ar.  Go to the panel near the man at the 
NORTHern section of the room.

	Examine the crane to use it.  The crane is unstoppable unless 
you hit something.  The objective, then, is to get the crane to the 
other side, or the SOUTHern part of the room.  You also have to get the
crane close enough to the green boxes such that you could jump on the 
crane, and then on to the boxes.  You will most likely not get this on
the first attempt.  If you fail, exit the room and re-enter to reset 
the crane's position.

	Anyway, the chest you receive from the crane manipulation is a
Power Magic.  Leave this room and go back the stairway with the man and
dog underneath it.

	Go upstairs, out the door, and examine the elevator in the 
center.  That done, head WEST up the stairs and through the door here.
This is a Kaiser's room.  Walk into this room for a scene.

	In this scene, you will be able to augment Stier's equipment 
and I suggest you do so.  The Stier has a very high defense, but 
horrible accuracy, therefore I would recommend the following:

	Resp Circuit : For increased response
	Beam Coat    : To halve beam damage
	Frame HP50   : To heal.  Stier has low fuel consumption.

	Once the scene has ended, examine the dresser at the NORTH side
of the new room to find Rico's MomentoChain.  He is the only one who 
can use this item.  Leave this room to initiate a scene.  Now, go back
into the Kaiser's room and get the chest here for a Knight Mail.  Exit
the central district and make your way to A Block.

	There is also a little game you can play with the metronome on
the next to the organ in the Kaiser's room.  Essentially, you should 
press X when the arm sweeps past the middle line.  If you do this 
successfully a couple of times(5-100) you'll get prizes depending on 
the number.  You will receive Gold each time you do this, and other 
prizes for 5, 20, etc.  This is not worth the time nor effort required
to get anything usable, so just skip the Metronome Piggy Bank minigame.


                          - Nortune A Block -
			    ===============

	Walk past the guards for a scene.  After that, go to the 
SOUTHWEST corner of the building you're on and jump _into_ the 
pipe/tube/chimney next to you.  You will land in a room.  Exit the 
room  and talk to the woman in the NORTHEAST corner for a coincedental
scene. When you leave, another scene takes place.  Go back to D Block.

Instructions:
-------------

	Upon your arrival, there will be a scene in D Block.  After 
that, head into your bedroom and walk near the bed to rest and 
formulate a plan.  When you regain control, it will be night and time 
to start the aforementioned plan.

	Leave the bar and you will be shown your target tower.  Go to 
the tower and to the Amazoness for a quick scene.  As soon as you 
finish this dialogue, the train will arrive.

	You must time these jumps well, if you fail the game will reset
to a scene just prior to your dialogue with the Amazoness.  Regardless,
time a jump so you land on one of the cargo cars.  Then jump from one 
car to the next while still on the train.  When you reach the front, a
scene will take place.  You will end up in the Gear Dock.


                     - Nortune Ventilation System -
		       ==========================

	The door to the east is locked and examining the south door 
will activate a scene.  Jump on top of the boxes in the room to the 
duct at the top.  Go into the duct.

	Follow the path until it splits.  The WEST path leads to a 
grate through which you can view a scene.  The SOUTH path leads to
another split.

	Take the SOUTH path to an opening that leads to a new room. 
The door in this room is locked.  Walk against the isolated box and 
push it such that it hits the other boxes.  Now, jump on it to the 
other boxes so you can go through the new air duct.  Go in the duct.

	Follow the path to another split.  Take the NORTH path to 
another viewing grate.  Go back SOUTH and take the SOUTH path. 
Continue until you reach an opening that leads to another room and 
scene.

	In this room, check the cabinet for a Master Key, a scene, and
a shiny Frame HP30.  Exit via the EAST door and follow the hallway to
another door.  Check the bench that is the farthest EAST in this room 
for 100 Gold.  Leave using the EAST door and follow the hallway to a 
door on the SOUTH side that requires the use of the Master Key.  Go in
the door.

	This room should be familiar because it's the one with the 
movable box.  Check the small box at the south side of the room for a 
Beam Coat.  Exit back into the hallway and go NORTH to another door. Go
through the door.

	Circle around to the room behind the counter.  Check under the
desk for a Minigear, a short scene, and a fight.  After you defeat 
them, you will receive an Evasion Ring.  Leave via the door on the 
NORTH side of the room.

	Another familiar room greets you.  This is the room in which
you started this whole mess.  Examine the panel next to the locked door
to unlock it.  Go through the unlocked door.  Follow the hallway to 
some stairs.  Go down the stairs and examine the opening next to them 
to find a SurvivalTent.

	Continue down the hallway WEST until you see a door.  Go 
through the door.  You will be in the Gear Dock.


                         - Nortune Gear Dock -
			   =================

	In this LARGE room, head toward the EASTernmost Gear dock in 
the center of the room.  There is a flashing panel next to this dock.
Examine the panel until Weltall shows up in the dock.  Walk toward 
Weltall and examine it to mount the Gear.

	The Green Gear here will sell you parts and repair as 
necessary.  Utilize this time to upgrade your Gear and equip it with 
good accessories.  Be sure to pick up some Extra Ar+3's as they are 
effective and cheap.  Another useful item is the Resp Circuit.

	Buy the Hot RodG if you want to, it'll be useful later.  I 
heavily recommend equipping a Beam Coat on all characters because most
of the severe damage that can hit you will be Beam damage.

	When prepared, head toward one of the lifts to ride up to the 
Arena.


                       - Nortune Battling Arena -
			 ======================

	There will be a short scene and a battle.

accessory item.

Instructions:
-------------

                          - Nortune A Block -
			    ===============

	In Nortune A Block, leave the house you're in and go toward the
main exit of the block.  Walk up to the guards and choose "Try to break
through!" for a scene.

	You will end up outside of Nortune A Block next to Big Joe.  
Talk to Big Joe and Fei will mention the 5000 Gold he stole from you
earlier (if you gave it to him).  Joe will mention that there is 
something there now and about the waitress in the Wild Cat Bar.

	Head to the Alley where Big Joe used to be and check in the
back.  Now, there is a M Disk there.  This is used in the jukebox in 
the Wild Cat Bar to play various music tracks.  Go to the Wild Cat Bar.

	Inside the Bar, there is a waitress who looks like a maid.  
Her speech is unsteady and weak, but she can change your party memebers
should you desire it.

	I suggest leveling Rico and Elly and learning their respective
deathblows.  This is, however, entirely up to you.

	Head out the world map.  Go east toward the forest, through it,
and follow the path through the mountains to the Factory.  The factory
is northwest in the mountains.  Out of that damn city at last.


                         - Goliath Factory -
			   ===============

	Make sure at least two characters are in Gears in this area. 
Head WEST then NORTH and follow this path until you see a Gear.  This 
is Hammer.  He can repair/refuel you and sell you items or even change
your party members.  Upgrade your Gears as needed.

	I suggest having a party of Fei, Elly, and Citan.  When you're
ready, go through the large doors ahead.  In this room, you cannot 
alter the camera and there are predestined, unavoidable fights along 
the way.  

	If you go back to hammer after having entered this room, there
will be enemies in the previous area where there were none before.  
This is the area surrounding Hammer and any place in the factory.  
Use this time to fight and level or have one character out of a Gear 
and learn deathblows.  It is convenient because Hammer is accessible 
for healing needs.

	Anyway, in the first room there are three fights.  When you are
attacked by two HarquebusMk10's, go EAST and open the chest for a Gold
Nugget.  Continue NORTH and through the door.


            - Goliath Factory: Hallway and Storage Area B -
	      ===========================================

	On this path you will eventually encounter a path split.  The 
first split goes SOUTH to a save point and the second one EAST to an O2
Cylinder.  Continue along this path to another door.  Go through it.

	In this room you will be attacked twice.  Head to the other 
side of the room and board the lift to go up to the conveyor belt.  The
belt will take you WEST to another room.

                  - Goliath Factory: Storage Area C -
		    ===============================

	Jump off of the belt and on to the floor.  There is a flashing
yellow panel on the WEST wall.  Examine it to reverse the direction of
the belt.  Leave your Gears and go west under the belt to get the Extra
Ar+3 in the chest.

	Head back to the lift in the SOUTHWEST corner of the room to 
ride it back up to the belt.  Get on the belt and ride it EAST for TWO
rooms.

                  - Goliath Factory: Storage Area D -
		    ===============================

	The yellow panel on the EAST side of the room drops three 
enemies.  The other yellow panel will reverse the direction of the belt
you just left.  The blue panel under the belt on the opposite side of 
the room will reverse the direction of the belt that is nearest to it.

	Hit the blue panel and get on that belt.  Ride this belt for 
TWO more rooms.

                  - Goliath Factory: Storage Area F -
		    ===============================

	In this room, the blue panel on the SOUTH wall reverses the 
belt that is oriented EAST.  The WEST blue panel on the NORTH wall 
drops two treasures, and the EAST blue panel on the NORTH wall reverses
the direction of the belt that you left recently.

	Examine the blue panel on the SOUTH wall to continue.  Ride the
new converyor belt EAST.  It will take you through THREE rooms, and 
when it's over, head WEST for a battle.

	Regardless if you won or not, a sequence takes place after the
battle.  Talk to Hammer for a humorous foreshadow of phrases.  Talk to
Citan for even more scenes.


                        - Floating Somewhere -
			  ==================

	Once you are in control of Elly, go EAST and jump to the other
section.  Examine the browinish door panel on the floor to continue.

	More scenes ensue.  

                             - Yggdrasil -
			       =========

	Eventually, you will be in control of Citan.  Head to the 
Bridge of the Yggdrasil and talk to Bart to continue.

	After even more sequences, you will control Bart.  Go to the 
Gear Dock and go inside of the Gear Shop.  Citan should be here and you
can talk to him for a scene.  

	Leave the shop and head to the SOUTHWEST part of the dock to 
the Stier.  Walk behind the Stier for more scenes.  After another 
ordeal, you'll wind up on the floating city of the Sea--the Thames.

Instructions:
-------------

                        - Thames Armor Ground -
			  ===================

	A scene will greet your arrival upon the Thames.  The area you
start in is the Armor Ground aboard the Thames' deck.  In the NORTHEAST
part of the Armor Ground is a weapons/accessories store, and NORTHWEST
is an items store.  Buy what you can afford or need to and leave the 
Armor Ground.

	Talk to a Gear on the main deck and answer 'Yes' to his 
question for a very fast tour of the deck.  Go to the Supply Entrance.

                       - Thames Supply Entrance -
			 ======================
	
	Here, walk to the large gun that is south of your present 
location.  Walk across the gun as a de facto bridge to the boxes across
the gap.  Now, walk over the wood plank to even more boxes, and over 
the big knife.  You should now be near two hanging cylinders, the 
highest one having a chest on it.

	The treasure is a Lunar Rod.  To get it, jump on the cylinders
until you reach it.  Head NORTH and talk to the man near the panel to 
buy Gear parts.  Upgrade your Gears as necessary.  Be sure to buy an
adequate amount of Extra Ar+4's because they are not only cheap, but 
very effective.  Also, armor is now available that is able to defend 
against ether damage as well as physical damage.  Usually this is an 
excellent deal, but at this stage in the game, ether damage isn't a 
huge concern.  Buy what you feel necessary.  Make sure to buy some 
anti-electricity Gear parts (e.g. Mica, Ground, Insulated Ar) for 
upcoming fights.  Equip these parts as well.  Head NORTHWEST to the 
corner of the Supply Entrance.

	Jump on the isolated box SOUTHEAST of the kid in the corner. 
Now jump over the fence to the EAST and grab the chest containing a 
SerpentGWhip.  Jump on the barrel and over the fence to get out.

	Head to the WEST side of the area and stand near the boxes 
adorned with cats.  Eventually, a cylinder with a treasure will pass 
overhead.  At this time, jump up and hit the bottom of the cylinder 
with your head to force the chest to fall.  Grab the Mica within the 
chest.  Head to the SOUTHEAST side of the area.

	Go into the door SOUTHWEST of the flaming barrel.  Drop down 
to the top of the boxes below.  Walk north to find a hole containing a
chest.  Open the chest for a D Circuit.  Leave by jumping on the small
box and out.

	You have now found the four treasures in this area.

	Go to the NORTHWEST corner of the Supply Entrance and talk to 
the little kid there.  Answer 'Yes' for both questions and he'll show 
you a card minigame.

	This is an irritating and unrewarding game to play.  I suggest
not wasting any time with this but if you find it intriguing you can 
pursue it.  Note that the arrogant wench atop the tires an the Armor 
Grounds is the Queen of the this putrid game.  If you somehow become 
skilled at this game, and have managed to beat the other people on the
Thames, challenge her to a game.  Take this opportunity to explore the
rest of the ship as well.

	Anyway, once you are finished with that episode, go to the 
Screw Elevator and then to the Bridge.


                           - Thames Bridge -
			     =============

	Talk to the man in red EAST of the door.  A sequence follows.
Follow him to the Beer hall.


                          - Thames Beer Hall -
			    ================

	The Captain is at a table by the window.  Talk to him for more
sequences, and then head back to the Bridge.


                           - Thames Bridge -
			     =============

	More scenes take place.  After that, head back to the Thames' 
deck for a short sequence.  Walk to your Gears and examine them to 
board them.  I hope you're prepared for the upcoming scene and battle.

special option 'Ygg. Depth Charge.'


                             - Yggdrasil -
			       =========

	Eventually, you'll end up on the Yggdrasil again.  Go across
the bridge connecting the Thames and the Yggdrasil to the screw 
elevator.  You'll end up on the bridge of the Yggdrasil once more.

	After some sequences, to the deck of the Yggdrasil.  Big Joe is
here with his lady-friend.  If you say that you're 'disturbing his 
amore time' you'll play the Thames card game against him.  The reward
for victory is a LongDarkCoat.  Go the Beer Hall.


                          - Thames Beer Hall -
			    ================

	There will be a few scenes here.  Go back to the Yggdrasil and
to the dining room(the room where Maison is usually found).


                             - Yggdrasil -
			       =========

	Go downstairs and north to the engine room.  A sequence will 
ensue.  After that, talk to Citan, then Elly, and Citan once more.  

	Upgrade everyone's Gears now.  Equip accessories that combat 
electricty induced damage.  A D Circuit or 02 Cylinder will be useful 
as well.  Consider equipping a FrameHPxx on your characters if you feel
so inclined.  I will say, however, that the next two fights are 
somewhat difficult.

	When you are prepared, go to the Medical Bay and talk to Elly
for a scene.  The menu will appear and you can make final adjustments.
A few scenes later you will encouter a battle.

|						        |
|	The Etone and Griffon enemies in this area are  |
| unusally powerful.  Even in Gears, Etones can still   |
| inflict massive damage to your party.  Griffons are   |
| managable in Gears, however.  I strongly suggest fle- |
| eing from Etones whenever you get the chance unless   |
| you are able to destroy them easily.			|
|_______________________________________________________|

	Do as Sigurd suggests and head NORTH to the Ethos HQ and go 
inside.  Walk down the aisle in the center to initiate a sequence.

	After that, follow Billy for another scene.  Go through the 
door while following him.  When he stops, go through the door next to 
him and downstairs.

	Go EAST to find him again and talk to him for another sequence.
Walk back upstairs once that is over.  Explore this hallway's rooms and
talk to everyone.  Go upstairs and do the same.  Go back downstairs for
a short scene.

	Head to the Infirmary for even more scenes and eventually you
will should go to the Yggdrasil's bridge.  Talk to Sigurd about Billy's
location and then go there.

Instructions:
-------------
	
	Go SOUTHEAST from the Ethos HQ to the Orphanage.  I know this
may sound idiotic... but put Rico in your party.  There is a good 
reason for this, don't worry.

	Head to the fenced area to the west of the house first.  There
will be a small bird-boy here.  Talk to him and agree to help him.  Now
you have to find his chickens and return them to the chicken coop.  
Note that you can only handle one chicken at a time.  For your efforts,
you receive the the Tag Badge.  Go into the house.

	At the WEST side of the room is a ladder.  Ascend it and talk 
to the little girl there.  Tell her that it's "Ok" and she will hand 
over Book 1.  Descend the ladder and go into the next room.

	Head into the first room to the EAST.  Talk with the boy 
sitting on the bed and make sure Rico is in your party.  A scene will 
take place if and only if Rico is in your active party.  The boy will 
hand over Book 3 afterwards.  Go back to the first room and speak with
Billy for a scene.

	Now, head into the next room and check the second door to the 
east.  There will be a short, and slightly amusing, scene before the 
boy gives you Book 2.  Head through the door to the NORTH.

	In this room, examine the bookcases to activate more scenes.  
Leave the Orphanage to return to the Yggdrasil.  Once there, go to 
Maison's Room for a scene.

	Talk to Sigurd for more sequences and you will end up in the
crew quarters.  Go back to Maison's room and talk to Billy.  This is 
the game's tutorial on how to use Billy and his unique weapons--his 
guns.  More scenes ensue and the party menu will appear.  I suggest 
Citan, Elly, and Billy for a group but choose whomever you want.

Instructions:
-------------

	Climb the ladder and go through the door.  Billy will comment 
on the layout of this room and brings the red switch on the middle of 
east wall to notice.  Examine the switch to turn on the lights and 
unlock type A doors.  Proceed to walk through the room and bust the 
boxes in your way.  Kick some boxes to the west to get a Penguin Coat.

	Go up the ladder and north to an opening.  Go down the opening
and get the B&JM10S Ammo.  Go SOUTH without touching the hanging hunks
of meat.  When you get to the wall, pick up the SurvivalTent and look 
at the east wall for a switch.  Examine the switch to unlock type B 
doors.
	
	Go NORTH and through the door.  The first room to the EAST 
contains a Cabin Key.  The other two on the EAST contain nothing.  
There is a shower in the first room to the WEST that initiates a short
scene.  The second room on the WEST contains a Silver Beret.  The third
room on the WEST contains ShotG60 Ammo.  Here is another version 
assuming you are facing NORTH:

|   1st room WEST: Scene involving shower |
|   2nd room WEST: Silver Beret		  |
|   3rd room WEST: ShotG60 Ammo		  |
|_________________________________________|


	The door immediately to your NORTH is locked at the moment.  It
also happens to be rusted shut so run up and strike it 3-4 times to 
knock it down.  Go north and up the ladder ahead.

	Further north a tube will open as you near it.  Make sure you 
have Billy's best ammo equipped for the impending boss battle.  Jump 
down the tube to being the battle.

]     Bloody is merely a slightly harder version of Redrum. [

] ly than Redrum did.  To combat this, simply use Zetasols  [
] to revive fallen comrades.				    [
]							    [
]     Bloody has three attacks he can use:	            [
]      1) Normal attack - Physical strike.		    [
]      2) 'Bloody Rain' - Fire-based attack that hits all   [
]	  and heals Bloody.				    [
]      3) 'Murder' - Drains a character of ALL HP, killing  [
]	  them and healing Bloody.	            	    [
]							    [
]     Remember not to use fire-based attacks/spells as it   [
] will heal Bloody.  He will also use 'Murder' 3 times in a [
] row at the beginning of the fight.  Recover fallen chara- [
] cters so you don't lose immediately.			    [
]							    [
]     You could also use Billy's 'Goddess Call' to quicken  [

]     Turn on boosters immediately.			    [
]							    [
]     This boss is unique in that it will grow in size and  [
] power each time it is hit with an ether attack.  The ca-  [
] tch is that it cannot be harmed by physical attacks until [
] it sustains atleast 1 ether attack.  You can also use Re- [
] nmazuo's square attacks as they are ehter-based but do NOT[
] cause the Wels to enlarge.  The Wels can enlarge a maxim- [
] um of 4 times during the course of the battle.	    [	
]							    [
]     I suggest hitting it with 10 fuel attacks to reach    [
] Attack Level 3.  Only after this would you hit him with   [
] ether attacks.  This will save some time and fuel in the  [
] end.						            [
]							    [
]     The Giant Wels has 3 attacks:			    [
]      1) Fuel drain attack - Drains 125 fuel.		    [
]      2) 'Enlarges when hit by ether' - Self-explanatory.  [
]	  Note that it also increases its attack power.	    [
]      3) Physical strike - Physical attack.		    [
]							    [
]     This battle requires Elly's presence for her ether    [
] abilities.  Also note that Renmazuo is equipped with et-  [
] her guns and can be used with the square(20 fuel) attack. [
] Elly's Aerods can also destroy the Wels as it inflicts    [
] ~2000 damage to it at the expense of fuel.		    [

	Once it is defeated, you will be on the Yggdrasil.  After a 
short scene, head to the Orphanage.  Go to the room in back where a 
bookcase was found earlier.  Examine the bookcase to put Books 1,2,&3 
in it.  This will unlock a secret passage.

	Push the bookcase all the way to reveal the entrance to the 
next room.  Inside lies the B&JM686 Gun.  Head back to the Ethos HQ.

Instructions:
-------------

	As you enter the Ethos HQ, a scene will take place.  Go to the
door on the NORTH then WEST side for a short scene and a battle.  
Afterwards there is another dialogue.  

	You can check the rooms in this hallway as you please.  
However, the last room on the WEST side of the hallway contains a few 
enemies to fight.  The room at the very end of the hall leads 
downstairs.  Go down to find a body and examine it for a little 
dialogue.  Go back upstairs to the hall.

	Take the passageway leading upstairs for another battle.  In 
the new hallway there will be two more battles.  The first room on the
 NORTH wall activates a small dialogue.  The other two rooms on the 
NORTH side have nothing in them but dead bodies.

	The room on the SOUTH wall contains three people in it.  Go 
back downstairs and go to the Infirmary.

                        - Ethos HQ: Infirmary -
			  ===================

	There is one person in the room where Fei was treated.  Go 
through the door to the WEST and the first door on the NORTH wall.  
Venture upstairs to find a Seal Ar and an Aquasol DX. Go downstairs.

	The second path on the NORTH wall cannot be accessed at the 
moment.  The other path is the one from which you came.  Go back EAST 
through two rooms.  At the bifurcation, go NORTH first.

	The first room has nothing in it.  The second contains a man 
whom you should talk to twice.  The third room contains Big Joe.  
Approach Big Joe for a scene after which he will depart.  Go back to 
the hallway and continue EAST.

	Go DOWN at the platform and continue down the hallway.  If you
go to the room on the EAST side of this hallway, you will be witness to
some rather lengthy sequences.  After that, go back to the hallway for
even more scenes.  Eventually you will get into a battle.

	Follow Billy's father into the NORTH room for more scenes.  
Once the party menu appears, pick a party and pilot the Yggdrasil 
toward the Thames.

                             - The Thames -
			       ==========

	Head to the Bridge and talk to the Captain for a scene.  
Speak with Hans for directions to the Dig Site.  Go to the Yggdrasil 
and depart from the Thames.  The Dig Site is directly NORTH, and 
located on the map if you talked to Hans, of the Thames.

Instructions:
-------------

	When you enter the Dig Site, take the elevator down and go 
through the path in the wall.  A soldier stands before you in the next
area.  When you approach the soldiers in this area, they will fight 
you.  If you want to avoid battles simply avoid the soldiers.

	Go through the door to the SOUTH for a short scene.  Once the 
elevator has stopped, proceed through the door.  Note that only the 
EASTERN door will open so use it.  Follow the path to a hallway with 
many locked doors.

	A soldier guards the only door in the hallway that actually 
opens.  Take the elevator down and go through the door.  Go NORTH to a
hallway.  Head WEST to pick up some B&JM686AAmmo.

	Head EAST and stop when you see two doors, one of which is 
guarded by a soldier.  Go through the guarded door and pick up the 
Sleep Guard.  Now open the first unguarded door and follow the path to
another hallway.

	When you see a single door, open it to pick up a Black Snake.
Continue down the hallway until you see two doors.  Head into the 
guarded room for a Panalphasol.  Go through the other door.

	Go downstairs and check the door to perform the necessary 
manual scan.  Now head back to the room that contained the Black Snake.
Examine the computer panel here to reset the Emergency Level.  You may
consider going into the EASTERN room to heal and save.  Enter the NORTH
door and head down stairs.

	Once the pressure decreases adequately, enter the SOUTHWESTERN
door.  Examine the computer panel here for scenes.  Approach the tube 
for more scenes and, eventually, a boss battle.

	Now comes the tedious process of working your way to the 
entrance of the Dig Site.  As you leave the current room there will be
a scene.  Do not forget to SAVE on your way out of the Dig Site.  As 
you are about to leave, you will get into another boss battle.

	After his defeat you are treated to more scenes.  But 
eventually you'll end up on the Yggdrasil.  Head down the ladder and 
save, heal etc.  Your target is the Gear Hangar.  Go behind Weltall for
some scenes.  Eventually, a party screen will appear and you _have_ to
choose people other than Fei and Citan.

	I suggest using Elly, Billy, and ...Rico.  Yes, he sucks; he 
sucks immensely.  His Gear, however, is not as bad as he is so it will
help in the upcoming fight.

	You might want to equip Seal Ar's on your Gears and FrameHPXX 
if you feel like it.  The upcoming battle is very fuel-intensive, so 
you might not have enough fuel to use to heal yourself.  Now, start the
battle.

	After this battle, Billy is able to use his 'Jessie Cannon' 
option in the Renmazuo.

	After some scenes, the party menu will appear and I suggest 
choosing Fei, Elly, and Citan.  Note that the Gear shop on the Y
ggdrasil has new parts and such that will be of interest to you.  Once
you're done, launch the Yggdrasil in the direction of Babel Tower.  It
is EAST of your current location.

Instructions:
-------------

	Enter the tower via the door.  Go to the end of the platform 
and descend to the lower section.  Head inside and come out of the hole
in the SOUTH side.  You will find an Ether Ar.  Jump into the water and
come up just below the entrance.

	Leap up about three steps and go UNDER the fourth one for an 
EarthVeil Ar.  Now, jump onto the fourth ledge and follow the path 
facing the WEST wall to eventually reach a Lite Ar+1.  Head back SOUTH
and then EAST.

	Jump EAST and then SOUTH.  Head through the hole in the wall.
You should see a chain dangling nearby.  You must jump onto this chain
and then swing to the other side.  The instructions to maneuver the 
chain will pop-up when you actually manage to jump onto it.

	Keep in mind that if you should fall in an attempt to jump on 
the chain, you will be plummet to the bottom of the Tower.  Obviously 
you will not die nor lose any health, but you will be at the bottom of
the Tower in the water.  This little jump will most likely take a(n) 
few/many/exorbitant number of attempts.  At least you will gain a few 
levels...

	Anyway, swing the chain until you reach your maximum velocity 
and jump to the next platform.  This platform will COLLAPSE when you 
step on it.  It will drop down no matter where you stand on it and 
despite how long you stand on it.  The easiest way to do this, it 
seems, is to jump to the middle section.  When the platform begins to 
dip downward, jump to avoid dropping to the bottom.  (You could even 
try jumping all the way forward if you like.)  After the initial jump 
and when the platform comes back up, step forward and jump to the next
platform.  Use whatever method necessary to reach the other side.

	Once on the other platform, jump on to the roof of the upcoming
path.  Here you will find a ThunderRodG.  Drop down such that you are 
outside of the hole of the pathway.  Go in the hole and follow the path
to its end.  A scene ensues.

	Be very careful in this area, because you will not want to 
climb all the way back up here in the event that you fall to te bottom.
Carefully jump up and grab the chain above you.  This will lead to the
relay section of tower.


                     - Babel Tower: Relay Station -
                       ==========================

	Go to the WEST end of the platform.  A small, character-sized 
door is here.  Exit your Gears and head through the door.  A Gold 
Nugget is inside.  Jumping on to the chair in this room will allow you
to examine the computer panel next to it.  Some scenes ensue.

	Head back outside and mount your Gears.  Jump to the lower 
catwalk that is near the train.  This will make you enter the train.  
Climb up the boxes to the upper level to initiate a sequence.  Grab the
Ether Ar and Beam Jammer that are in the two chests.

	Leave your Gears and climb up the handrails to the door.  
Examine the wall below the door to jump up into the next room.  This 
room contains an Old Ciruit and a Gold Nugget.  Jump up to the chair 
and check the SOUTH computer panel above it to initiate more sequences.
Eventually, you will be in a battle.

	Enter the Tower via the SOUTH door.  Follow the path to a hole
containing a chest, a Ground, and a character-sized door.  Enter the 
small door.

	In this room you will find an E Circuit, an O2 Cylinder, and a
Gold Nugget.  Go to the NORTHernmost computer panel and examine it to 
unlock a door you will encounter later.  Leave this room and mount your
Gears.

	Jump out of the hole and head SOUTH.  Eventually, you will see
a deep hole.  Jump into it and head NORTH for a Wind Veil Ar and a Veil
Doubler.  Go SOUTH and jump out of the hole.  Head SOUTH until you 
arrive at a room with hanging pipes.

	This room has no visible floor, but you cannot fall off of the
pipes.  Make your way to the other side of the room.  Be sure to pick 
up the Ice RodG and Fire Veil Ar on your way there.  Continue along the
path.

                       - Babel Tower: City Area -
			 ======================

	This new room is rather large and tall.  In the NORTHWEST 
corner you will find a healing/refueling Gear.  Go SOUTH for the Stone
RodG under the red bastion.  Go back and jump on top of the red 
structure and go SOUTH.  I'm sure you're loving all these jumping 
puzzles.

	Jump on the large Traffic Jam and jump onto the other red 
platform when you get close to it.  Go NORTH and jump to the white 
platform, then a Traffic Jam.  At the top, grab the G-M10S Ammo and go
to the next white platform.

	Jump on the next Traffic Jam and ride it to another white 
platform.  Jump to the next red platform for the WaterVeil Ar.  Go to 
the EAST wall and jump into the gap.  Be careful here and use the gray
stripe in the middle of the wall as a guide for your jump.  You 
*should* land on a Traffic Jam and ascend such that you can jump to the
SOUTH side.

	Climb the blue pipes you see to reach the Top of the Tower.

Instructions:
-------------

	This city is amazing for its historical background and 
excellent atmosphere.  Be sure to talk to everyone in the Library when
you get the chance.

	Ride the elevator in the center of the lower level(your current
location, provided you didn't move) to the main city level.  You will 
be able to see the map of Shevat.  Go to the white statue and examine 
it to receive the Dawn Rock.  Go to the NORTH part of the city, Aphel 
Aura.

                             - Aphel Aura -
			       ==========

	Continue along the path and gawk at your surroundings.  
Eventually, you will see a white dog.  Fall off to the ledge next to 
the dog and through the nearest door.

	After the short scene, talk to the aged, yellow Chu-Chu between
the two display cases.  If you have the RPS Badge, Tag Badge, and the 
H&S Badge, he will give you a random item and a Power Ring S.

	Talk to a gray Chu-Chu under the platform and answer 'Not 
necessarily' to receive an Aquasol DX and two Aquasol S's.  Jump from 
the platform to the pink Chu-Chu in the middle of the room on the lamp.
She will tell you of the rocks you can collect.  This step is CRITICAL
in finding the other two rocks.

	The aged, yellow Chu-Chu on the platform will sell you 
weapons/accessories and the orange Chu-Chu behind the counter peddles 
items.  When you are finished, examine the gray elevator to the lower 
level.

	Leave via the WEST door and speak with the old lady here.  Tell
her that you enjoy fishing to receive a Spider Web for 50 G.  Note that
you may already have this web if you got it in Lahan at the very 
beginning of the game.  Even so, ask to buy the thread or you cannot 
fish in the other room.  The old woman will then notify you of the fish
in the fountain in the other room.  Go to the other room.

	Examine the fountain to start fishing.  When a fish bites, reel
it in, and if it's a red fish you will find a Dark Rock in it.  
Occasionally, the line will break and you will have to buy another one
from the old lady.  There is also a chance that you won't get the Dark
Rock even if you catch the red fish.  If this happens, just keep trying
and it will happen eventually.  When finished, go upstairs and back 
outside.

	Go EAST and follow the path to a house with a gray platform in
front of it.  Enter the house and take the platform down to the lower 
level.  Talk to the capped man to upgrade your Gears.  Head back 
outside and take the platform down to another house.

	Head inside the new house and examine the doll for the Dusk 
Rock.  

For emphasis, here are the locations of the rocks:
     _________________________________________________________________
    |                                                                 |
    | Dawn Rock:  Opposite the White statue on Shevat map.	      |
    | Dark Rock:  Inside of a red fish in the fountain in Aphel Aura. |
    | Dusk Rock:  Within the doll in a house in Aphel Aura.	      |
    |_________________________________________________________________|


	After checking the doll, head upstairs and into the room to the
EAST.  Examine the rocking horse here to initiate a sequence.  Before 
you go to the palace, go to the entrance of Aphel Aura.

	Head to the platform next to the old man.  Go downstairs and 
through the door in the SOUTHWEST portion of the room.  Head to the 
single platform and examine it to place the three rocks on it.  Go up 
to the secret room.

	Check the desk for the Chu-Chu Idol and a short sequence.  
Check the shelf on the opposite side of the room for: a Power Crisis, 
Panalphasol, Hob-Steak, Physimentsol, Sampson'sHair, Yamato Belt, Hard
Star, Speed Star, HP Drive, EP Drive, STR Drive, VIT Drive, ETH Drive,
and ETHDEF Drive. Whew.

	Check the NORTH bookshelf for some information and go back to 
the Shevat map.  Go to the Statue to go to the Entrance to Shevat 
Palace.

                            - Shevat Palace -
			      =============

	Go to Maria.  She will tell you where you should go.  Explore 
all the rooms.  The NORTHEAST room contains a save point.  When you are
done, go through the double doors to meet Queen Zephyr.

	Walk closer to her to initiate a scene.  Go to the room with 
the save point to rest and save.  Talk to the Queen and tell her 'My 
heart is set!' for more sequences.

	Eventually you will have to choose who to leave behind to 
protect the Queen and you have to take Maria with you.  Exit the palace
and talk to the orange Chu-Chu to buy anything you may need.  Go to the
Shevat Lower Level.  A scene will take place on the way there.  Head 
through the door to enter the Emergency Shaft.

navigate the next area.  Go to the EAST to a door that leads to a 
stairway.  Go downstairs and go through the NORTH door that leads to a
hallway.

	Go EAST and down the platform to obtain the Queen's Rod.  Go up
and WEST to another platform.  Go down and WEST, descend the ladder 
here, and walk near the green jewel to know what it does.  Examine the
jewel and jump on the platform to ride it EAST.

	Jump on to the next open path, descend the ladder, and take the 
platform down.  You will now be able to use the Shevat Map to help you
navigate this area.

	Travel SOUTH past two bifurcations to find a Battle Apron.  Go 
NORTH and then WEST at the first path split.  Continue down this path 
to a door on the SOUTH wall.  Head up the stairs and into another 
hallway to find the Ruby Helmet, Rosesol DX, and Aquasol DX.  Head 
downstairs and into the next hall.

	Go EAST, then NORTH, and finally WEST when the path branches 
apart.  Continue along this path until it bifurcates.  Go SOUTH to 
obtain the Whip-Lasher.  Head NORTH to another split and then EAST to 
a guarded door.

	The following stairway does not lead to a new area, but rather
to Big Joe.  Go SOUTH from the stairway to get an Economether.  Go 
NORTH from the stairway to a platform and take it down.  Go EAST, down
two ladders, down two platforms to the west, and take another platform
down.

	Continue to another bifurcation.  The WEST path leads to a save
point and the SOUTH path leads to the exit.  Examine the hole to exit 
the shaft.

	Go through the WESTern door and double doors proceeding it to 
intitiate some dialogues.  When you're back in the Queen's room, you 
will need to choose the people to defend particular generators.  I 
recommend the following based on the difficulty of the fights at each 
generator:

	Generator 1: Elly  [Vierge]
	Generator 2: Billy [Renmazuo] / Bart [Brigandier]
	Generator 3: Citan [Heimdal]  / Rico [Stier]
	Generator 4: Fei   [Weltall]

	When you are confident with your choices, prepare for the 
battles ahead.  You can buy items from the orange Chu-Chu.  Character 
equipment can be changed via Margie in the sleeping room.

	When prepared, go to the Queen's room and say that you're ready
to battle.  I recommend finishing the battles sequentially in numerical
order.  Note that you will be able to check your equipment prior to 
each battle.  When you are done the battles will commence.

	Generator 1...

recover their armor status.  This can be done via a skill such as Fei's
"Inner Healing" and Citan's "Sazanami."  Also, equip the newly acquired
Gold Plate on the next character.  A FrameHPxx is also useful if you 
don't feel very confident or don't want to do all this over again.

(*)This is an incredibly useful item.  It increases the rate at which 
   you learn deathblows.

	Many scenes later, you'll be in the resting room.  Head to the
Yggdrasil and launch toward Nisan.  Gaspar has taken off your limiters
allowing you to learn and use your elemental, level 7 deathblows.

	I VERY strongly suggest making use of that WizardryRing and 
learning all your elemental, level 7 deathblows now.  The emergency 
shaft in Shevat is a prime location for this work.

Shakhan Monk	 1101	500	---

Instructions:
-------------

	The welcoming party of Nisan is a series of battles with 
guards.  These battles are unavoidable.  Some scenes ensue once you 
have finished the battles.  Pick a third party member when prompted and
you will soon have control once again.  Buy anything you need and leave
Nisan via the NORTHWEST exit.

	Follow the road as it goes behind the cathedral and talk to 
Margie when you see her.  Margie joins your party as you head into the
Mausoleum.  She will occasionally heal you or attack some enemies.  
Head downstairs to a chamber.

	After a scene, you will have to find a control panel.  If you 
want to find it by yourself, search the NORTHEAST corner and mash the 
activate button.  Once found, another scene occurs and you can go 
inside.  Do so.

	Once inside, you will fight immediately.  After many more 
scenes, head to the elevator in the center of the room and go up.  
Leave the elevator and follow the path to a new door.  Head through 
the door.  A few scenes later, head through the next door.

	Go NORTH and WEST at the split and through another door.  Pick
up the Desert Worm in this room after the scene finishes.  The computer
panel that is NORTH of the center can be examined and initates a 
dialogue.  Head through the NORTH door.

	Go EAST at the split and go up in the elevator.  Leave and go 
SOUTHWEST at the bifurcation.  Head through the next door and continue
in this hall for two doors and go into the THIRD door.  Head to the end
of the hall and pick up the Deathblower1.  Go back through the door and
continue NORTH.

	Go through the next door and follow it to the end of the hall.
Take the door to the NORTHWEST and check the eye-scanner for a scene.
Go back outside for another scene.  Walk betwixt the Gear's legs and 
examine the wall there.  Go back to the room that contained the Desert
Worm.  The tool man there will sell items to you.

	Check the computer panel NORTH of the center for more scenes.
After that, go back to the room with the Gear.  Scenes initiate before
you reach the room, however.  Finally, go to the Gear and prepare 
yourself for a battle.

	After some more scenes you'll be back in Nisan.  You can choose
a third party member as you like.  I suggest Maria or Citan because the
next boss battle will be in Gears. 

	Equip anti-Seal accessories on your Gears (e.g. Seal Barrier, 
Seal Ar).  The next boss loves Seal attacks.  Heal and refuel and leave
Nisan and head WEST to the cave.

	Inside the cave you will fight a few battles.  After that, 
continue along the path and open the door at the end to initiate some 
dialogues and a battle.

]     Shakhan has 3 offensive abilities:		    [

|	Most of the enemies in this area use electric   |

|Also, press triangle repeatedly to swim faster.	|

	After the inital dialogue, go forward until a path bifurcation.
Go RIGHT at this fork.  At the next bifurcation, take another RIGHT.  
Eventually you will reach a small nook which contains a Mermaid Mail 
and a save point.  Submerge once more and head back to the split but 
go LEFT this time.

	At the next bifurcation, the right path's current will be too 
strong to overcome so head LEFT.

	In this cavern you will find a Dark Rod and another chest.  
This other "chest" actually serves as a switch.  If you activate it, 
it will stunt the current in the RIGHT path allowing you to traverse it
without difficulty.  So go back to that path and follow it to the last,
small cavern room.  This room contains a Deathblower2.  If you go 
through the door in the room, you will be treated to some sequences 
then a battle.

	With that battle out of the way, you will see a bunch of scenes
and such.  Eventually, you'll be back at Shevat in the save room.  This
is the last time you will see this world for a while.  Take some time 
and wrap up anything you need to, level as needed, learn deathblows, 
visit areas, and the like.  Once you go to Solaris, you will not be 
able to return until disc 2.  This is what many call a "point of no 
return", although you will return...just much later.

	I suggest leveling your characters to approximately level 70.
At least get Fei to level 70 as you will be able to use his Kokei 
deathblow at that point.  The others will be fine and able at lower 
levels.  In fact, if you don't care for Kokei, you should be able to 
get through Solaris at level 50.  Also, remember that Emeralda has to 
learn a few deathblows even though she joins your party with many all 
ready learned.

	When you are prepared, go to Queen Zephyr's chamber and tell 
her that you are ready to go to Solaris.

Instructions:
-------------

	After some time you will FINALLY be in Solaris.  You might 
notice that you're upside-down.  This will normalize soon enough so 
don't worry.

	Go left and to the end of the tunnel/tube for a dialogue and 
exit for another dialogue.  Head NORTHWEST and into the last elevator 
of the last block.  Here you will find a friend and a dialogue.  Leave
this room and go to the block betwixt the dust chute and the 
watchtower.  Take the elevator and talk to the man in the room.  In 
order to get the Work Permit, you must agree to help this man(Samson).
Do so and go to the watchtower and talk with the guard.

	Follow the path into the second tube and go up.  Go through the
next door.  You will have to stay out the Security Cube's 
line-of-sight.  If caught, you will be sent back to the front door.  
Anyway, go WEST in this room to the corner.

	Once there, go through the door and in the tube.  The tube 
next to you contains an Aquasol DX.  Whether you obtained that or not,
continue along the path.  You will be stopped for a dialogue, after it
go through the door for another dialogue.  Leave through the NORTHEAST
door.  

	Eventually you will reach four white doors.  You can buy 
anything you need here: items, weapons, and armor.  Leave when you're 
done and go NORTHEAST.  Enter the building with the revolving door.  
The room with the flying Gear in it also has a poster of a girl that 
looks remarkably like Tifa from Final Fantasy VII.  A cameo appearance
perhaps.  Anyway, go up the elevator and into the southeast room.  Talk
to the red woman for Tickets to the upcoming ceremony.  Go downstairs 
and leave this building.

	Go SOUTHEAST until you see a guard dressed entirely in black.
Walk near him for a dialogue and past him for a couple of scenes.  
You'll wind up in the sewer eventually.  Until you leave the sewer, you
will be pursued by Security Cubes.  Luckily, they're very weak, dealing
a whopping one damage consistently.

	Go through the sewer and pick up the Crimson Vest, 
FeatheredCap, and Aquasol DX along the way if you so desire.  Climb up
the ladder at the end of the sewers.  Check the gate for a surprising 
scene.

	Go inside the house for a few dialogues.  After the steamy 
scene, leave Elly's room and go downstairs and into the room SOUTHEAST
from Elly's room.  Talk to her mother for a short dialogue.  Leave this
room and go into the room across from it.  Talk to Elly's nanny for a 
Psycho Rod.  Leave the room.

	Go upstairs and to the room NORTHEAST from Elly's.  Examine the
computer on the desk for some scenes.  After that, go up stairs and 
back to the office where you began.  Head inside and walk near the 
SOUTHEAST door for a scene.  Go back to the 3rd Class District.  Once 
there, go WEST to the dust chute.  Examine it to go inside and check 
the panel on the NORTHEAST side of the machine to continue.  When 
control shifts back to Elly, leave Elly's room to obtain the Army 
Cardkey and to see some sequences.  Go back to the chute and examine 
the green panel again.

Instructions:
-------------

	This next area, especially Krelian's Lab, is extremely long and
has a rather high encounter rate.  Go through the door to the 
NORTHWEST.  Continue until a fan becomes visible.  The fan will deal 50
damage if you run into it so to avoid this, push the metal box into the
blades.

	Jump down in the NORTHEAST side and go through the door.  
Continue until you face a bifurcation, go SOUTHEAST for a Hob-Steak, 
then the NORTHEAST path to a door.  Continue and jump on the boxes to 
get to an Aquasol DX.  As you leave, a dialogue occurs.

	Leave and travel SOUTHWEST to a raised platform.  Go NORTHWEST
to a door and a Hob-Steak.  In the next room, examine both sides of the
computer panel in the west corner.  One of the panels will give you the
code that unlocks the scanners in the last room.

	The computer in the NORTHEAST aprt of the room can activate the
coded panel.  On the panel, a space is a zero and a block is a 1.  
(Space = 0, Block = 1).  There are three codes you can input:
	
	Code : Output
	---------------------------------------------------
	0101 : Deactivates scanners. (required to continue)
	1001 : Receive a gold nugget. (may not work)
	1111 : Receive gold bullion.

	Back outside, , head down to the NORTHWESTERN conveyor belt and
go NORTHEAST.  As you approach the door, a scene takes place.  After
it, go to the SOUTH corner for a Zetasol and Gold Nugget.  Go through 
the door in this room then through the next one.  Ride the platform and
continue until you are in a large room.

	In this room, take the NORTHEAST exit and follow it until a 
path split.  Each vein has a treasure in it.  Those treasures are an 
Aquasol DX and a SurvivalTent.  Go through the door at the end of this
path.

	Go to the middle of the walkway and examine the panel for a 
short dialogue.  Continue and you will be in a room filled with cages.
Each of these cages contains an item, but you can only open them if you
talk to the man in the room.  Examine a panel next to a cage to open 
it.  However, you must battle the cage's occupant if you want to 
receive the treasure.

 Cage # | Treasure        | Occupant(s)
 ---------------------------------------
      1 | Hob-Meat	  | Neo Wels (4)
      2 | Muscle Belt	  | Orphan
      3 | Scales          | Neo Wels (4)

	Whether you obtained the items or not, exit via the SOUTHWEST 
door.  Here you will find another room o' cages.  The cages are 
numbered from SOUTHWEST to NORTHEAST.


 Cage # | Treasure        | Occupant(s)
 ---------------------------------------
      1 | Hob-Steak	  | Neo Wels (4)
      2 | Eyeball	  | Neo Wels (4)
      3 | Angelic Robe	  | Dorothy

	Proceed through the SOUTHWEST door.  Along the way you will 
come across two rooms containing: an Eyeball and an Extra Ar+6 in one
room; a Hob-Meat and a Gold Nugget in the other.  After the rooms is 
another door containing an Aquasol DX and a control panel.  Examine 
the panel to unlock the seal at the end of path.  Leave the room.

	Go NORTHEAST, through a door, up a flight of stairs, and 
through a NORTHEAST door.  Go upstairs once again, through a pink door
(collect the Aquasol DX and SurvivalTent here), and through a SOUTHEAST
door.

	Proceed forward and through the SOUTHEAST door.  Examine the
mid-southwest part of the room to obtain a Silver Ar+1.  Go through two
doors SOUTHEAST, then one door NORTHEAST.  You should be in another 
room with one cage and a lot of monsters.

	The only even mildy challenging battle here is against the 
Bloody Bros.  They are reincarnations of Redrum and Bloody and, as 
such, can be killed using the same methods.  There may be two of them,
but they have 4242 HP each, so with elemental deathblows these guys are
nothing to worry about.

	There are only two items in the cage: an Ether Veiler and a 
Deathblower3.  After you're done, exit this room.  Go through the 
SOUTHEAST door.  Eventually this path will branch; take the SOUTHWEST 
path.

	On this path are two rooms containing two chests.  One is a 
Dark Helm and the other is Dark Armor.  The first room contains a panel
that plays an audio sequence.  This sequence serves as a password for 
another panel.  Note that the room at the end of the hall contains some
B&JM686SAmmo.  Head back to the split and take the NORTHEAST branch.

	Eventually you will come to the door which requires a password.
This is the password tooted by the panel earlier.  For your 
convenience, here is the correct sequence: UP, DOWN, UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
Proceed through the door and turn SOUTHWEST.

	The three doors in this hallway contain: a Silver Ar+1, an 
Extra Ar+6, a SurvivalTent.  Proceed NORTHWEST to obtain an Extra Ar 
DX.  Go SOUTHEAST to find another hallway containing four doors.  These
doors contain: a Sonic Wave, a Silver Ar+1, a Gold Nugget, and a Speed
Ring S.  The last room is peculiar because it also contains holograms 
of the entire party.  You can examine each hologram for additional, 
enigmatic information.  Exit this room and continue along the original
path to a large door.

	Examine this door for a dialogue.  Proceed SOUTHWEST, 
SOUTHEAST, and through the door.  After some more talking, go SOUTHWEST
to the end of the path.  Once you regain control, go SOUTHWEST and 
through the door at the end of the path.  Buy anything you want from 
Hammer.  Also, from this point on, Citan will wield his katana in 
battle.  This nearly doubles his attack power, making him by FAR the 
strongest character, unless you have Fei's Yamikei deathblow (which is
the only thing capable of exceeding Citan's damage).  Assemble a team 
of your choosing, save, and continue though the SOUTHEAST door.

	The door immediately following this hallway contains 
B&JM686SAmmo.  After this room the path will split.  Go NORTHWEST 
through the door, another door, and a hallway.  In this hallway, the 
third door on the NORTHWEST wall contains a Panalphasol, a Party Change
point, and a Save Point.  Proceed through the hallway, through the door
at the end, through yet another hallway, and another door.  Eventually
you will reach a bifurcation.

	Go SOUTH and in the first door for ShotG70 Ammo.  Through 
another door is a pathway leading to the next section.  Go SOUTHWEST, 
then NORTHWEST, and take the door on the NORTHWEST wall for an Aqualsol
DX.  Proceed down the hallway to a split and take the SOUTHWEST branch.
Go through the door.

	Head SOUTHEAST to a bifurcation.  SOUTHEAST goes to a save 
point and SOUTHWEST will continue the story.  At the next split,
NORTHWEST leads to a SurvivalTent, whereas SOUTHEAST continues the 
story.  Enter the hangar and after the scenes, pick your party and 
prepare for battle.

	You might notice something different about disc two.  In fact,
it may even seem like a different game.  Specifically, you are no 
longer part of an adventure.  You are merely watching a story unfold 
rather than taking a part in it.  The characters have a tendency to sit
in chairs and narrate the story to you as a slideshow takes place in 
the background.  What the hell.  

	One theory is that the Xenogears project suffered a massive 
budget cut.  The result of this financial crisis is... disc two, a 
truncated, concise, castrated, stupified version of what should have 
been.  This isn't a substantiated theory but plausible.

	The other theory is that this was intentional.  Whatever the 
case may be, disc two is disc two, and you're going to have to live 
with it.

WEST part of the house and inside the Nanomachine room for another 
scene.  Go back to the previous room and eventually you will be caught
in a battle.

	Note that Fei now has Weltall-II, a much improved version of 
Weltall.  You will have several more attacks such as "Flaming Hell" and
"Thor Wave."  However, the most powerful attack is "System Id" which 
utilizes the power of Id and automatically launches Weltall-II into 
Infinite/Hyper Mode.

Instructions:
-------------

	The Gear closest to you serves as a save point and item 
distributor.  To the EAST you will find an Ether Guard, to the WEST you
will find a Starlight.  Go NORTH and into the dungeon itself.

	Proceed NORTH, turn WEST at the split for a Gold Bullion, and 
then turn EAST.  Continue forward to another split.  Go WEST into a 
darkened room containing a WizardryRing.  Examine the panel in the 
NORTHWEST corner.  Go back to the split and take the NORTHERN path.

	Examine the box in the SOUTH corner and you will obtain a fuse.
Go back to the darkened room and examine the panel to put the fuse in 
it.  Examine it again to unlock Type A doors. Leave via the NORTH door.

	At the bifurcation, go WEST for a SurvivalTent, then SOUTHWEST
to another split.  The SOUTHERN room contains a Zetasol DX and a 
computer panel that activates the main systems.  The columns in the 
room are the password to the computer panel.  The number for each 
letter is simply the position number of the MISSING panel in each 
column, top-down.  The correct password is: 0320.

	After you activate the main system, examine the WEST computer 
panel to open all Type B doors.  Leave the room and go NORTH then EAST.
This large room has four exits and a panel.  The SOUTH door goes back 
to the entrance, the NORTHERN path leads to a computer terminal, the
NORTHERN panel activates the elevator in the previous room, and the 
EASTERN and WESTERN paths contain clues to an upcoming puzzle.  Go 
NORTH, activate the elevator, leave the room and use the elevator in 
the center of the room to go down.

	Examine the small panel to the WEST and it will show you two 
rows of numbers with letters.  The hints said that both rows of numbers
must have equal sums without reusing numbers.  Note that both rows must
equal 26, hence:

	A + C = 10
	B + D = 9

	Any combination that satisfies these prerequisites will work.
For example:
	       (Location of panel)
	A = 2  West
	B = 5  North
	C = 8  East
	D = 4  South

	After inputting those, examine the mainframe and release the 
lock.  Go back to the elevator and go down.  Go east and examine the 
panel in this room (the Anima Relic room).  You will soon be in battle
with the elements.

Instructions:
-------------

	After choosing your party, you will end up in this dungeon.  
The dancing robot, Shopkeep Johnny, has returned but has no new wares.
Examine the large boulder to the NORTH and push it EAST.  Exit your 
Gears and go into the small door.

	Examine the first pillar in this room.  Look at the etchings on
the walls and the first pillar.  Each wall gives a hint as to where the
stones need to be put in the holes in the north side of the room are.
Here is a table of the stones and how to get them:

     Stone # | Location/Method of extraction
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
	   1 | Check behind the pillars, eventually a stone will fall 
             | down.
	   -----------------------------------------------------------
	   2 | Push the first stone behind the central pillar.  Jump
             | on to the stone then on the pillar.  Jump while on the
	     | pillar to obtain the next stone.
           -----------------------------------------------------------
	   3 | Go WEST from the stone behind the central pillar and      
             | examine the dark section of the wall.
	   -----------------------------------------------------------

	After obtaining all the stones, push them into the holes on the
floor in the NORTH part of the room.  Go back outside.  Mount your 
Gears and go EAST.  The treasures on the floor are an Aquasol DX and 
an Ether Guard.  Traverse the canyon by leaping on to the platforms and
making your way across.  Go through the opening.

	Jump on the path that is the farthest to the SOUTHEAST.  
Proceed EAST until the path becomes too thin to walk with your Gears.
At that point, dismount your Gears and walk until you see a path 
leading NORTH.  Follow that path through a door.

	Proceed NORTHEAST and grab the SurvivalTent on the way.  Go 
through the door at the end.  The next room has trapped floors so be 
careful of where you walk.  There are two treasure chests and a statue
in this room.  The floors surrounding the chests and statue are trapped
except for one direction.  I recommend jumping from chest to chest 
rather than walking.

	The first chest contains a Rose Tabard.  The second one 
contains an Aqusol DX.  Finally, jump near the statue/pedastel toward 
the EAST end of the room.  Walk west from the pedastel and fall through
the hole.  Once you begin to fall, press against the EAST wall quickly.
If done correctly, you will land in a secret passageway.

	Proceed into another room.  This room is also trapped, but in a
different way.  Go to the center of the room and DO NOT MOVE.  The 
ceiling is filled with spikes except for the center part.  When the 
ceiling fully lowers to the floor, jump on it and ride it to the higher
floor.  Go through the door here.

	This room isn't trapped, rather it is has a simple puzzle.  The
goal is to lower the level of the water from the current 10 to 5.  The 
trick is that you can only raise/lower it by 3 or 7 levels at a time.

	The four switches near the pool can aid you.  The SOUTHERN 
middle switch lowers the level and the NORTHERN middle raises the 
level.  In the corner of the NORTH wall is a swtich that sets the level
of all transfers to 3.  The switch in the corner of the SOUTH wall sets
the level of transfers to 7.

	There are several solutions to this, but here is one:

	# | Action | Amount | Resulting Level
	-------------------------------------
	1 | Lower  |   3    |      7
	-------------------------------------
	2 | Lower  |   3    |      4
        -------------------------------------
        3 | Lower  |   3    |      1
	-------------------------------------
        4 | Raise  |   7    |      8
	-------------------------------------
	5 | Lower  |   3    |      5
	-------------------------------------
	
	
	After you solve the puzzle, a scene takes place.  Go through 
the door.  Go SOUTH to acquire the Beastly Robe and push the rock to 
the WEST and follow the path.  Go back and mount your Gears.  Head 
toward the lakebed and pick up the King's Helm and EtherDoubler.  Exit
via the door to the EAST.

	You will be in a cavern with a save point.  I HIGHLY recommend
saving.  The next boss drops a very special item that it only drops if
you destroy it before it self-destructs.  This is rather difficult to 
do, so a save here would be immensely helpful.  Go EAST and through the
door into the Anima Relic room.  Examine the panel for some scenes and,
eventually, a battle.

]   Difficulty: Medium (If you want the Trader Card)	    [
]							    [
]     Hammer isn't very hard unless you're trying to get    [
] the Trader Card.  But I'll assume you want it as it's	    [
] awesome and very useful.  If you're too lazy to go to the [
] Items section, the Trader Card will ALWAYS give you a	    [
] rare item after every fight.  You'll have to have it 	    [
] equipped of course.  Anyway, this makes getting those	    [
] incredibly cheap "Speed Shoes" very easy.		    [
]							    [
]     What makes this difficult is that Hammer will self-   [
] destruct once he takes 28000 damage, or goes to 20000 HP. [
] He will glow red and one of your characters will say,	    [
] "I've a really bad feeling..."  Usually, you would	    [
] flee so you don't get caught by the blast.  If you do     [
] this, however, you won't get the card.		    [
]							    [
]     The basic strategy, then, is to deal about 25000 or   [
] slightly more damage to him and then get Fenrir into	    [
] Infinite Mode and activate System Id.  Have Elly use high [
] level deathblows.  This also means that everyone must be  [
] at attack level 3 before you damage him further than the  [
] 25000 mark.						    [
]							    [
]     You could also equip Elly with 3 Power Magics and an  [
] EtherDoubler to deal 9999 damage with Aerods.		    [
]							    [
]     Activate boosters for everyone.  Get Fenrir to attack [
] level 3 as quickly as possible.  Have Weltall use 30 fuel [
] attacks and have Vierge use Aerods.  Once you have dealt  [
] 25000+ damage to him, attempt to get Fenrir into Hyper    [
] mode.  Once he is Hyper mode, use 'System Id' on Weltall  [
] and Aerods with Vierge.  The only problem you may have is [
] if Fenrir doesn't go into Hyper mode quickly, but usually [
] I can get it in 2 turns.  If successful, you will have a  [
] shiny, brand new Trader Card.				    [

	After many scenes and a saving oppurtunity, you will be in 
Merkava.  Go EAST to find a shopkeeping Gear.  Upgrade all your active
Gears and proceed NORTH for a battle.  Be sure to put a FrameHPxx (I 
suggest 50 or higher) on each Gear.  Also, put only Ether Armors on if
you have space for accessories because the next fights have few to no 
physical attacks.  Eventually you will be in a battle.

Instructions:
-------------

	In the hideout, go NORTHEAST to find yourself in the central 
room.  To the SOUTHWEST is a item vendor.  Hop over the counter and go
through the door.

	Go SOUTH then SOUTHEAST for a scene.  Talk to Hans for another
dialogue.  From now on, talking to the dolphin in the gray coat will 
allow you to play the Thames Card Game.  If you beat the dolphin, you 
will get an Emer Jr.Doll.  Beat him five times to obtain an Elly 
Jr.Doll.  If you do this, however, he won't play with you anymore.

	Go NORTHEAST, NORTH, through the NORTHEAST door, NORTHEAST, and
NORTHEAST through a door.  Talk with Dan for a scene.  If you have 
Midori's Ring from the VERY beginning of the game, speak with her and 
she will give you the HerculesRing.  If you didn't get it, go back to 
Lahan and get it from behind the flowerbed outside Citan's house.  Go 
back SOUTHWEST then SOUTHEAST.

	Walk to the top of the building and talk to Queen Zephyr.  Go 
back to the central room.  Talk to the person behind the NORTH counter
to buy Gear parts.  Don't blow too much money yet, though, because a 
hidden shop not far from here has much better wares.  Go into the 
passageway behind the salesperson.  In the large room, head WEST and 
talk to the man here.  He will upgrade the Kishin Sword into the Kijin
Sword, Fenrir's strongest sword.  Make sure you unequip the Kishin 
Sword before you talk to the man, otherwise he won't notice you have 
it.  Go back to the central room.

	Talk to the woman near the grey platform and the birds.  If you
pay her 20000 gold, the birds will leave and let you ride the platform
up.  Ride it up and examine the glass displays for : a HerculesRing, a
Vivid Turban, Speed Shoes, a Yamato Belt, a Hero Costume, and a 
WizardryRing.  Go back down once you get everything.

	Go through the NORTHWEST door.  Talk to the man and give him a
Gold Nuggest, and a Gold Bullion later on, and he'll find a jukebox.  
Go back to the central room.

	The EASTERN passageway leads to a room filled with cats.  In 
it is the family of the old woman in Bledavik.  Go back to the central
room.  Leave the hideout by going through WEST exit.  Head into the 
Yggdrasil and go to Margie's room.  Talk to Margie for a scene.  Go to
the Gear dock and go to behind Chu Chu and ask for a "lowdown" on the 
"Gear."  After that scene, go to the bridge, talk to Sigurd and launch
the Yggdrasil.  Go to Taura's house to the NORTHEAST in the middle of
a forest.

(^) A somewhat rare encounter.
(*) This item is insanely cheap.  It gives you auto-haste when in 
character and auto-boost (at no fuel cost) when in a Gear.  If you can,
get about 6 of these, one for each useable character.  However, this is
a very rare drop and is extremely hard to get without a TRADER CARD.  
If you don't have the card then don't bother with this.

Instructions:
-------------

	Go into the house and talk to Taura for a short dialogue.  
He'll give you a Manly Mantle and a Goddess Robe.  When finished, go 
back to the Yggdrasil.  Go to where Babel Tower is and then head NORTH.
You should find a Lighthouse.  Make sure you put Emeralda in your party
before going in the lighthouse.

Instructions:
-------------

	Some of the enemies here are pretty difficult, so be careful.
Go to the elevator and go DOWN.  Go SOUTH and pick up the Deathblower3.
Go EAST, then SOUTH, then EAST and pick up the Deathblower2.  Go back 
WEST and NORTH.

	Dismount from your Gears and go in the alley between the two 
buildings.  Pick up the G-Godfather here.  The building next to the 
alley has a small door.  Go inside and look behind the stage for a 
SurvivalTent.  Go back outside and NORTH to another door.

	Inside, examine the stacks of books and shelves for 
information.  Go upstairs and get the Deathblower1.  Go outside again 
and go EAST to the last door.

	Here you will find Big Joe and he sells the _best_ Gear 
parts/equipment/everything in the game.  He also sells various Drives 
that can boost your stats.  However, they are rather expensive and 
unnecessary since all of the final battles take place in Gears.

	Buy anything you want.  Keep in mind that with the Omega100 
engines, you will have enormous power but little fuel.  Although 
Z-Chargers are excellent, this still means you can't heal in battle 
effectively.  Also, the four chests in Joe's room spawn random items 
every time you enter the room.  Exit the building and go EAST and then
SOUTH until you see a crack in the southwest corner.

	Leave your Gears and enter the crack.  Proceed through the 
paths and enter the subway car to find a Z-Charger.  Go up stairs and,
if Emeralda is with you, scenes will ensue.  With a grown-up Emeralda,
exit the Lighthouse.

	Remember the Mermaid Tear that you got from the troubled man in
Lahan in the very beginning of the game?  Now is the time to use it. 
Go to the Snowfield Hideout with adult Emeralda in your party.  Head 
through the SOUTHEAST door and proceed until you see an old lady 
surrounded by debris.  Speak with her and she will give you a Mermaid 
Ring for the Mermaid Tear.  Leave the Hideout and go to Nortune.

Joe is there with a jukebox.  Of course, you can obtain items by 
exchanging points with the girl behind the counter in the battling 
Arena.

	Leave Nortune and go to the desert-covered island that is WEST
of Bart's hideout.  Land in the green patch of land.

	Once you're in the area, go EAST three times and then NORTH 
once.  After a short scene go NORTH and climb up the skeleton and take
the sword from its back for the Yamato Sword.

	Go back SOUTH and then WEST.  The two chests here contain 
Kingly Armor, and a Godfather.  You can only get one at a time due to 
the current of the sand.  The first time you fall into the sand, you 
will fight a Wyrm.

	If you want to leave, fall down the sandfall and go WEST once.
The first time you do this, a Dune Man will be here with a sand buggy.
If you help him push it out of the sand, he will take you out of the 
isle.  If he isn't here the other times, just keep heading WEST.  Now 
it is time to finish up anything you want.  The next section details 
preparations that need to be made to battle Deus.


=======================================================================
=========================== - Preparations - =====================X5213
=======================================================================

	Since all of the final battles will take place in Gears, there
is no need to level your characters any further.  I would get Fei to 
level 80 to learn Yamikei, though, if you haven't all ready.  You can 
go higher if you want to, but it's unnecessary.

	Due to the importance of Gears, it is essential to fully equip
your Gears and tweak their setups accordingly.  Note that some 
character items have an effect on their respective Gears.

	Here is a setup that will dominate Deus and his subordinates.
It is rather extreme and not necessary, but it's hilariously powerful.

	Now, this setup is extremely expensive and you probably can't 
buy all these things immediately.  A good way to make money is to kill
Croaker Tribes men (in Anima Relic 2 or Lighthouse or on the world map)
and sell the Scales you get (6x per fight at least) in Nortune.  
Another way is to equip the Trader Card and fight Neo Gimmicks and Neo
Tears outside of the Snowfield Hideout.  They drop Golden Hoods and 
Golden Vests, both of which can be sold in the hideout for good prices.

	Note that I only use these 6 characters for the final battles.
I use the first 3 to manuver through the final dungeon.  The second 3 
will take out the mini-bosses and the first 3 will fight Deus.

	When you're prepared, go to the island SOUTH of Anima Relic 2.
There you will find Merkava.  Enter it.

Instructions:
-------------

	Go NORTH for a scene.  Go in to the hole that appears in the 
floor.  This is the interior of Deus.  Once you get here, you can 
access the map to see where you are going.

	Go NORTH and then NORTHEAST when possible.  Proceed until you 
are able to go NORTH.  Avoid the lasers and continue until you reach a
path split.  Take the NORTHEAST path and turn SOUTHEAST when possible.
At the next split, go SOUTHEAST for a save point and NORTH to continue
the game.

	Walk off the end of the platform.  You will fall down a very 
long tube filled with lasers.  Try to avoid the lasers.  Eventually you
will reach the next section.

	Once you land on top of the platform, go NORTHEAST for a scene
and examine the yellow platform in the center of the current platform.
This will take you to the lower level.

	Go SOUTH, up to the second level, SOUTHWEST, and jump on top of
the center platform.  Examine the rod to push the lower pathway EAST.
Go to the first floor and head EASt, NORTH, and NORTHEAST.  Jump on top
of the center platform and examine the glowing pillar to move a pathway
connecting an exit.  There is just one left.

	Head back SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, WEST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, and 
SOUTHEAST to a doorway.  Proceed SOUTH, EAST, and NORTH to be back 
outside.  Examine the region north of the center for G-Godson Ammo, 
then head back SOUTH.

	If you need to repair your Gears, go SOUTHEAST for a while to 
find a repairing Gear.  Then go back and go SOUTHWEST then SOUTH and 
you'll be outside again.  Go SOUTH and up to the upper level.

	Go EAST, jump up, and examine the glowing pillar to move the 
second path to the exit.  Go back WEST and to the lower level.  Proceed
SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, WEST through a doorway, WEST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, and 
SOUTHWEST to the outside.  Here you will find a Pilot Shield.  Go back
SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, EAST, NORTHWEST, and NORTH.  Follow the path to 
an opening the floor.  This leads to the final area.

	You will fall through another tube o'lasers.  Eventually you 
will be in the area where you fought Ramsus in the Amphysvena and Miang
as Opiomorph.  Go EAST to buy anything you need and you can leave from
here as well.  When done, go back WEST.

	This is the final save before your battle with Deus and his 
subordinates.  Continue NORTH until you see an opening.  Jump in to 
confront Deus.

	After the scene, you will be able to attack Deus.  If you want
a challenge, fight him without fighting any of the orbs around him.  
However, he will be very powerful and have many nasty attacks.  The 
orbs around him are minibosses which give Deus particular powers.  If 
you kill a miniboss, Deus loses an attack, some maximum HP, and some 
speed.  So you can severely wound Deus before even fighting him.

	Since the orbs each have different colored lights covering 
them, this is the way I will distinguish them.  Here is the key:

Boss Name   | Color  | Ability*
-------------------------------------------
Metatron    | Gray   | Earthly Annointment
Sundel	    | Pink   | Healing
Marlute     | Yellow | Fuel Drain
Harlute	    | Blue   | Heavenly Annointment

(*)Note that "Ability" means they possess this ability and Deus will 
lose said ability if you kill that miniboss.

	Metatron is probably the strongest of the four, so you might 
want to kill it first.  I suggest fighting them in the above order.  
I also suggest using Renmazuo, Andvari, and Seibzehn to fight the 
minibosses.  There is a party change beacon here for your use.  Use 
this party to destroy the four minibosses and let the other three 
(Xenogears, Fenrir, and Crescens) destroy Deus.

	With a party of Bart, Billy, and Maria, run into the gray orb 
for a battle.  If you have Speed Shoes, don't boost, it'll just drain 
your fuel.

	Switch to the party consisting of Xenogears, Fenrir, and 
Crescens.  Run into Deus to begin the battle.  If you're wondering, 
the music that plays during this fight is entitled, "One Who Bares 
Fangs At God."  Note that his HP lowers for each boss you've killed.  
The multiple HPs are if you've killed [all|1-3|0] of the minibosses.

	Citan's swords amplify his already stellar performance in 
battle.   Even his Omnigear Fenrir can use a sword [discussed in the
-Gears- section].  Swords greatly increase Citan's attack power and 
change all of his deathblows, especially his hyper-deathblows which are
now utterly lethal.  I absolutely love his Crystal Water 
hyper-deathblow; it is fantastic.  Swords are always a great addition 
to any weapon repertoire.

			      Whips/Lashes
			     /============\

	Whips are often even weaker than rods, especially toward the 
end of the game.  In any case, Bart's weapons do raise his attack power
considerably and if you use Bart--always upgrade them.  I never used 
Bart unless forced to, hence I never had to upgrade too often.

				  Guns
				 /====\

	Guns themselves do not alter Billy's attack power 
significantly, but rather they facilitate the use of more powerful 
ammunition.  As such, the higher rank a Gun is, the more powerful the
ammunition can be packed into it.  Always buy the best Gun for Billy, 
it will allow you to use better ammunition you buy or find.

                               Legend
                      --------------------------
Name:
-----
	Name of the designated attack.

Attacks needed:
---------------
	The precise order of attacks needed to perform the designated 
attack.  T(Triangle), S(Square), and X(X) represent the buttons that 
need to be pushed in order to perform any given attack.

Element:
--------
	The element associated with the attack.  Note that most attacks
have no elemental attribute.

AP:
---
	The number of ability points needed to perform the designated 
attack.

Level Learned:
--------------
	The level at which the designated attack is able to be 
performed.  This assumes that the deathblow has been trained to 100 
prior to attaining the given level.  If 'Innate', then the deathblow is
already useable when the character is useable.  Note that even if you
learn a deathblow, that is you train it to 100%, you will not be able
to use it until you attain the level at which you unlock the deathblow.
Deathblows learned as a character correspond with the deathblows 
available to each respective Gear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                                Of Gears  
                           ------------------


	Gears are an integral part of this game, so get used to using 
them.  If you haven't noticed your Gears leveling up, don't worry: they
shouldn't.  A Gear's stats are entirely dependent upon the parts that
constitute it.  The pilot's stats do not influence the performance of 
a Gear.


Fuel
----
	Fuel is used to do nearly everything.  It is used for Special 
Option abilities, repairing in battle, attacking, moving with boosters
on, et cetera.  Because fuel is a precious resource, conserve it at all
times.  If you have a chance to charge to regain fuel, use that time to
do so.

Engines
-------
	Engines determine the fuel capacity and, more importantly, the
power output of a Gear.  Later in the game you might notice some very 
high power engines with puny fuel capacities.  This is to force you to
choose either power or longevity in battle.  With a Z-Charger (500 fuel
per charge) it won't matter anyway so go for higher power on a few 
Gears.

Frames
------
	A frame determines the maximum amount of HP a Gear can have in 
battle.  Better frames allow for more HP.  It should be obvious that 
you will always want to have the best frame you can buy.

Armor
-----
	Armor is a very basic concept.  It provides defense from 
physical attacks and/or ether attacks.  Later in the game, you will see
armors that have both ether and physical defense boosts.  Buy these as
ether damage is large facet at that point in the game.  Of course, 
these armors are expensive and often have lower physical armor boosts 
than others that ignore ether defense.  Choose between physical and 
physical/ether protection.

Attack Levels
-------------
	Attack Levels determine not only the deathblows you can use, 
but the amount of Fuel you can regain with 'Charge'.  Suppose you 
charge 30 fuel at an Attack Level of 0.  If you reach Attack Level 1, 
you will charge 50 fuel, at 2 you will charge 70 fuel, and at 3 you 
will charge 90 fuel.  This is very useful for boss encounters and 
tight situations. 

Deathblows
----------
	Deathblows are used by achieving an Attack Level of 1, 2, or 3.
The number of attacks made on the enemy determines the attack level. 
Hyper-Deathblows are used when a Gear enters Hyper Mode and can use 
Infinity attacks.  You can reach Hyper Mode only when you get the 
Omnigear Andvari late in the first disc.  Charge at attack level 3 
until you hit hyper mode.  Hyper mode lasts for three rounds (six 
rounds with a Holy Pendant on your character) and allows for the use 
of powerful Infinity attacks (hyper-deathblows).

	Deathblows starting with a T (Triangle) require an Attack Level
of 1.  Those starting with S (Square) require an Attack Level of 2, and
X (X) an Attack Level of 3.  Hyper-deathblows are an exception because
they happen once you hit Hyper-Mode (Infinite Mode), hence no Attack 
Level requirement is necessary.

Hyper Mode
----------
	Hyper Mode is achieved by charging at attack level 3.  The 
chance of hitting hyper mode is displayed on the right side of the 
battle display.  This percentage is increased as your HP becomes lower,
much like how Powercrisis affects your battle strength at critical HPs.
Even so, this percentage will probably not go much above 50% even at 1
HP.  The exception, of course, is the Xenogears which has a perpetual 
99% chance of hitting hyper mode when it charges at attack level 3.

 For use in the abilities sections:
 =================================
 S. T.  =   Single Target
 Self   =   Only the character casting can be targeted
 Area   =   Effects all enemies within a small area
 All    =   Effects all enemies within a large area
 A. A.  =   All Allies

                                  G01

	The Weltall is a very reliable and strong gear.  It has high 
block and evade rates and has enough strength to combat hordes of 
enemies.  It is a little on the fast side, and has a good offense and
defense.  Weltall is a very well-balanced Gear.

                                  G02

	The revived Weltall has upgraded offense and defense.  The 
agility is the same, but its power and stamina have increased 
drastically.  Of course, it also has implemented within it the 
infamous "System Id" which allows for instantaneous hyper mode.  All 
these features make this gear one of the strongest in the entire game,
and definitely the strongest of your party at the time.

	That's right, Fei controls the Xenogears, the indisputably 
strongest Gear in the entire game.  The game is named for this Gear so
it must be excellent.  And believe me, this Gear lives up to its name.
With an insane attack power and defense, nothing will stand in your way
for more than 3 rounds.  Bosses fall quickly to the constant 99% chance
of reaching Hyper Mode and the ridiculous 19998 damage this 
monstrousity can deal.  This is the best Gear in the game, period (not
to mention the best looking).
	Rating: The _best_ Gear.

                                 G04

	The Vierge is probably the strongest ether machine in your 
party excluding Emeralda.  Its physical capabilities are limited, but 
it is fast and agile with powerful ether amplification.  If 
appropriatly equipped, its -Aerods- ability will desecrate enemies.  
You can even use it as a physical Gear with an appropriate 
configuration.

	You cannot control Elly when she uses this Gear as it is a
story battle that you witness.  From what I can see, however, it seems
fantastically powerful.  I imagine it would be a drastic improvement 
from the Vierge.  The name of the Gear is Regrs and it looks very much
like Vierge except it has a red skirt and wing-like attachments on its
back and hips.

	With a high speed and low agility, this is the most ambivalent
Gear available.  Its attack power and defense are about equal to 
Weltall's, perhaps slightly inferior.  It's rather apparent, however, 
that this Gear is made for speed and not for attack.

	The Omnigear Fenrir is everything Heimdal wasn't and more.  
It's the same Gear except with a huge attack power upgrade via the 
Gear and the sword it can use.  Its defense, offense, and agility have
all increased drastically.  This Gear is very powerful.

	This Gear can be useful at times, but generally it is just 
cannon fodder.  Brigandier has a decent attack power and defense, but 
with its pathetic speed you will hardly notice that.  Power without 
agility nor speed- that is complete trash.  The Gear is just like its 
pilot: useless.

	Andvari is actually useful for a short time.  It is the first 
Omnigear you receive, so it'll be the strongest for a very short period
of time.  Its attack power and defense have risen considerably, but 
when you get other Omnigears or Weltall-2, you'll leave Andvari behind.

	Utter trash.  High attack, defense, and stamina but horrid 
speed, agility, and hit percentage.  Add the fact that you actually 
have to then use Rico as a character and you can just forgot Stier 
exists.

	Crescens is the fastest Gear in the whole game.  It 
consistently has low hp, but it's attack power can be great with an 
appropriate engine and accessories.  Its ether capabilities are 
astounding and tantamount to Vierge.

	Seibzehn has tremendous power, hp, defense, and stamina, but 
poor speed, agility, and hit percentage.  In most respects, this Gear 
is fantastic and nearly invincible.  It even starts with all of its 
deathblows learned.

	Chu-Chu can either be the best or worst character depending on
how many stat-up items you give her.  She has no deathblows, average 
power, poor speed and one useful spell that heals Gears.

Quick Mount
-----------

	Press R2+L2 on the world map or a dungeon to quickly mount or 
dismount your Gears.


Measurement Conversions
-----------------------

	Apparently Square USA has the real-world equivalents for the 
measurements made in Xenogears.  I don't remember the source for this 
information as it is just saved in a text file I have lying around.  
Anyway, here they are:

1.00 Sharl  =  0.964 meters       = 3.16273 feet
1.00 Karn   =  1.080 metric tons  = 2308.99 lbs
1.00 Repsol =  0.970 km/h         = 0.60273 mph
1.00 Zeitle =  0.017 hours        = 1.02    minutes


Yggdrasil in Reverse
--------------------

	Press R2 while flying the Yggdrasil to shift it into its 
reverse gear.
