Ignored / Locked out Aspects:
------
Crystal Minerals
	Need 3 x Forest on Ocean, so it sacrifices Superior Domestic Animals or Monsoon
	Exclusives:
		3 [FF]: Platinum (D)
		4 [FFFA]: Coal (A)

Exotic Animals
	Need 2 x Forest on Mountain, so it sacrifices one Superior Mineral and both Sublime Mineral Aspects (Noble and Seismic)

Toxic Herbs
	Sublime need 3 x Swamp on Swamp only to get Oppium Poppy
	Sacrifices Superior Herbs or Animals, limits Reaction and Predator to Great
	Exclusives:
		1 [S]: Nightshade (F), Marsh Mallow (S)
		2 [S]: Foxglove (S)
		3 [SS]: Hemp (S), Chilli Pepper (D)
		4 [SSSA]: Oppium Poppy (D)

		4 [DDDA]: Oak* (F), Brazilwood* (S)


"If I go for Seismic with the Mountain Giant, I get Predator (more wealth), if I go for Noble with the Mountain, I get Reaction (tech)"

Villages
--------
Start with either:
	1 Forest, 2 Desert, 3 Swamps
	2 Forest, 1 Desert, 3 Swamps

After 6 Embassadors (i.e, collect 2nd F), destroy/swap 1 Swamp Village

Priorities:
Forest F-S
Mountain D-S
Swamp SDF (or DSF)

Always complete 6 Basic Projects *before* completing an Upgraded Project!
Always complete 4 Upgraded Projects before completing a Great Project!
Always complete 4 Great Projects before completing an Upgraded Great Projects!

Mechanics

War
----
https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/118053/44129

The most surefire way to start a war is with Greed. High greed villages will always attack their neighbors.

A village that decides to go to war will take the Geography into account. They are more likely to attack a neighbor without oceans or mountains in their way.

A village will usually try to attack their weakest neighbor. Military strength of a village tends to correspond to their prosperity, and how much Danger is in their borders.

A village that is too busy defending itself from Danger in its borders will not go to war, nor will their Greed increase. However, over time villages get better at keeping Danger at bay, and in the long run they get stronger because of it (if it does not destroy them or vice versa).

A village that has won many wars will tend to go to war again.


Resource Usage
--------------
What I've written is valid for v1.1.0.0.

The summary is:
	Resources (Food/Tech/Wealth) are all treated the same.
	The maximum speed at which resource use can grow is 1 unit per second, but you need at least 122.5 units more than you're currently using to get that growth rate.
	  (This will get you massive amounts of greed, of course!)
	The theoretical minimum speed at which resource use can grow - if it is growing at all - is 0.02 units per second.
	The speed of resource growth behaves linearly between those two extremes.
	Overshooting the target slightly can save a lot of time: getting from 14 Food to 15 Food takes about 70 seconds if your total Food is 15,
	  but if your total Food is 18 it takes only 35 seconds. [Precise numbers to follow]

growth on next tick = 5 if excess > 122.5
growth on next tick = 0.1 + excess/25 if excess between 0 and 122.5
'growth' on next tick = excess/25 if excess is negative
(excess = total resource - resource in use)

RNG
----
Save/Reload before action/popup will change:
	Project *Specializations*
	Village Name
	Aspect level
It will NOT change:
	Village location (when nomad already roaming)
	Project
		Level 1 is determined prior to village foundation! (when nomad roaming)
		Level 2 is determined prior to Level 1 completion
		Use Muck Bomb to change it. Respawn after 3:00

 Well, I think that the game mechanics was thought with substituting the resources in mind. I think thee objective is to complete projects and unlock achievements in an Era.

With that in my mind, all the resources you put down are temporary until you have only tier 3 resources, Superior Resources. That's why not only you should change old obsolete ones, but you are supposed to do it.

Let me share how I interpret a normal Era game, considering a 6 village planet:

First Part: Settling down and completing first level Projects:

You settle down 6 villages. All of them starts the level 1 project. You go from village to village and complete the level 1 projects with only Level 1 Resources, using the low tier symbiosis, few or none transmutions and few or none aspects. You will put enough to complete without creating greed. A fruit giving 10 food is enough at this moment of the game.

At the end of this phase you will have 2 Giants with only one Ambassador, 2 with 2 Ambassadors.

That means that 2 giants will have Tier 2 Resources unlocked already, before the second phase of the game.

Second Phase: Completing second projects in at least 4 villages

I usually move all my 4 giants to each village and complete the project requirement at this one, before moving all 4 giants to the next.

You will put new resources on top old ones and get new simbiosis, focusing on the requiremente of each project. The yeld of Tier 2 resources is much higher. You will also get access to new resources if they start as a tier 2. Gold and Silver, for example, come from a second level mineral only.

If a plant with 10 food is enough to complete level 1 projects, it is not enough anymore to complete second level projects. Why settle with 10 if the same fruit, with the same simbiosis, will have more aspect slots and better output?

At the end of second phase, you will have 10 ambassadors (even if you complete all 6 projects, it is capped).. That means:

2 Giants with 2 Ambassador, 2 Giants with 3 Ambassadors.

Thrid Phase, the third projects - Greed will be the main challenge

At end of phase two, you will have unlocked some Greater Aspects with two Giants, the ones with 3 ambassadors. That will give you access to new plants, minerals and animals: Gold, Silver, Coyote, Plum Tree, Tuna, Marliin, Aluminium, Tea Plant, Lychee and several others)

To get the third wave of projects, these new resources will be necessary. You will need to put them on top of old resources, make new symbiosis BECAUSE new resources will become available and now the requirements will be way bigger.

While working on the village, it is very likely that they will become greedy, so things can fall apart. Specially if you play like I do, one village at a time, instead of spreading all over the place.

Ending all the level 3 projects you will have:

2 Giants with 3, 2 Giants with 4.

The 2 giants with the 4 are the key. They will have Superior Resources and Sublime Aspects.

Final Phase: Completing the dreadful Level 4 Projects

It is very hard to complete any level 4 project without a Superior Resource and Sublime Aspects. Like you said, the requirements seems absurd. 1250 Tecc in Labs, 1250 Food in Castles, 1250 Wealth in Multinationals, WTF?

But actually ysing the right combination of a resource that NEED a Superior and NEED a Sublime aspect will get you there. The 2 giants that have already the 4 ambassadors will be the plowhorses in this, setting resources in the scarce land inside borders. You will need every inch of your borders.

Usually the Plants, Animals and Minerals that are Tier 3 AND transmutes from 2 Sublime Aspects are groundbreaking and necessary.

Orange Trees with Sunflowers will give ridiiculous amount of Food and Tech

Oil with Cacao Tree will do the same

Pandas with Fluorite will give you Wealth and Food. Ruby with Cardon Cactus will do the same.

All those combinations NEED a level 3 Aspect and a Level 3 initial resource that was out of grasp before.

Since I've completed all achievement, all projects, all unlocks, what I am doing in the game right now is trying to complete all projects in a 2 hours era, in all villages.

After that was done, I am now trying to complete the same with some unusual combination of ambassador. Sometimes with only one desert and one swamp, and 4 forests, and things like that.

So far it was all doable (challenging, but doable), so while the requirement for tier 4 projects can look ridiculous at first glance, they are very far from impossible.
