Lamp uses 1% of fuel per second, every lamp, every boat.
Full Power ('F') eats fuel at a 100% markup (2x quicker) for only a 1.75x increase in speed.
Half vs Full throttle (speed 1 and 2, not 'F') have a linear relationship.
Half throttle uses 0.05% of the engine power in fuel per second and Full throttle uses 0.1%.
So an engine with 1000 Power uses 1% of fuel per second. 2% with the lamp on.

Starting engine power: 800, so 0.8%F/s
(the lamp costs more than the fuel!)
