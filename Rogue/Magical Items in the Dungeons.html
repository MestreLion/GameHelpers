		There are a 5 different kinds of magical items in the Dungeons:Potions, Scrolls,
		Rings, Wands, and Staves. For those items that, when used, provide an immediate effect
		(Potions, Scrolls and Wands/Staves), I've tried to match up the effect with the correct
		type of item. 
		<BR>
		 
		<B>
			Save versus magic
		</B>
		 deserves a note on most pages, but this 
		<I>
			is
		</I>
		 the magic page so here goes:Whenever you might be adversely effected by a magic
		item, your character (and monsters too) gets a saving throw (1 die of 20 sides),
		if the throw is high enough, you resist the effect. Your saving throw improves as
		you go up in level. You can save vs. Poison, Paralyzation, luck, death, breath and
		magic.

		Potions:
	</B>
	<BR>
	 Potions come in the following colours, assigned randomly when a game is started:
	<BR>
	 amber aquamarine black blue brown clear crimson cyan ecru gold green grey magenta
	orange pink plaid purple red silver tan tangerine topaz turquoise vermilion violet
	white yellow
</P>
	 
	<P>
		To use a potion, you (q)uaff it. Quaffing an unknown potion isn't necessarily a good
		idea, but the only 
		<U>
			really
		</U>
		 nasty potion you often encounter on earlier levels is the potion of blindness. However,
		if you've already discovered most of the useful potions, there is a decent chance
		that a new unknown potion is a bad one, and it may be worth using an identify scroll
		on it.

			Scrolls:
		</B>
		<BR>
		 When you find a type of scroll for the first time, it will have a very odd name
		(see the Guide to the Dungeons for an explanation) consisting of random syllables.
	</P>
	 
	<P>
		To use a scroll, you have to (r)ead it. Most of the scrolls in the Dungeons aren't
		very dangerous, and quite often even the worst ones are no more than a nuisance.
		However, the 
		<U>
			really
		</U>
		 useful ones (like the identify scroll, which you can use to identify an unknown
		magical item) are often very rare. The motto, therefore, is to use them 
		<B>
			wisely
		</B>
		.
	</P>
		KSlack9898 points out the following on scare monster scrolls:
	<UL>
		<LI>Dragons can still shoot flame at you even while scared from a scare monster scroll.  
		Very annoying if you cant even attack the dragons because other monsters are blocking them.<P>
		<LI>If you step on a scare monster scroll, and can't pick it up because your inventory is full, the scroll is activated until you move.
		But since you didn't touch it, it doesn't crumble when you step back on it again.  
		This can be repeated over and over until you actually pick up the scroll.<P>

		 Although the effect of most rings is difficult (if not impossible) to work out without

	</P>
	 
	<P>
		To use a ring, (P)ut it on. Rogue will ask you if you want to wear it on your left
		or right hand (unless you're already wearing one). Rings are often not the most useful
		magical items, and most of them should not be worn permanently because they cost
		food points (except, of course, the ring of slow digestion) and food often becomes
		scarce on later levels.
	</P>
	 
	<P>
		When a new game is started, the materials listed below are assigned randomly to the
		ring types:
		<BR>
		 agate, alexandrite, amethyst, carnelian, diamond, emerald, germanium, granite, garnet,
