The purpose of this guide is to tell you all about the 103 weapons in 
Dark Cloud. I have divided the guide into sections to make it easier to 
locate the information you are seeking. This guide also contains 
an attachment section, so you can find out all the information on the 
attachments of Dark Cloud. Well, here it goes.

Dark Cloud Hint
---------------
Hint: Extra Lives

Equip Revival Powders as Active Items. That way if you die on a 
Limited Zone Floor or if you don't have any Stand In Powers left 
you won't be forced to leave the Dungeon and loose half your money. 
When you do die with a Revival Powder equipped then the enemies 
will pause and the message "Revival Powder Used" will appear. 
After you hit X the fight will continue. You may not notice 
the message appearances if you were in the middle of an attack 
and just were button-mashing X.

*****How To Build Up Weapons*****
---------------------------------

Ok, over the course of helping a lot of people with Dark Cloud I've come
to notice something; some people do not really know how to make build
up their weapons. It's not that they are dumb by any means, it's just for
some reason or another the tutrial's information iluded them. Well, lucky
for all of those people I put a lot of "*" next to this, so hopefully they
won't miss it this time. Shall we begin?

When you go to the weapons section on the menu you can view all the weapons
you have at that time. Once you select one you will notice that there is an
option called Build Up. (Note: This will not appear on base weapons or weapons
that are a final evolution.) Once you select this option you can scroll
through the Basic, Elemental, and Anti stats for that weapons with R1 and L1.
You notice the stat in Red? Those are the stats that must be increased in
order to Build Up that weapon into a more powerful, advanced form.

How to upgrade those stats? That's simple. Once a weapon is at full abs, or
you have a Power Up Powder the option Upgrade will appear on the weapons
screen. That is the key. However, just upgrading your weapon will rarly, if
ever get it to the point where it can be build up. Like I said before you
must increase the stats in Red, all of them including Elements and Antis.

To go about raising stats you need up put on attachments before you select
the option Upgrade. If attachments are present on the weapon when this
option is selected than they are permenently absorbed into that weapon.
Once you absorb enough attachments that increase a certain stat in Red
it's requirement for the next build will be met and it will turn White,
just like all the other stats that you do not need to rise and once all
that stats are White the options Build Up will start to flash and that
means you are ready to go to next weapon form.

-For information on attachments see the: "Attachments: section
-For information on the best way to Build Up your weapons check out
the: "Leveling Up Tips" section along with any other section you
need to utalize in order to create your ultimate weapon.
-For information on Building Up the special swords in the Mardan Eins
line check out the 3rd Note under Toan's weapons in the "Evoltion" section.

--------------------
*****The Basics*****
--------------------
In Dark Cloud you rely on your weapon for survival, so it is important 
that it is very strong and can overcome any situation or monster you 
encounter. That means having the right stats on your weapon. The stats 
for weapons in Dark Cloud are as follows:

-----------
Basic Stats
-----------
-Attack (At) = How much attack power the weapon possesses.
-Endurance (Ed) = The higher this stat is the less WHP you lose with 
                  every hit / shot.
-Speed (Sp) = The more speed the weapon has determines how fast after a 
              combo / shot you can start attacking again, or how fast 
              you can shoot again.
-Magic (Mg) = How much magic power the weapon possesses. The higher it 
              is the more affective your element will be.
-Weapon Health Power (WHP) = This, along with endurance determines how 
                             many hits / shots your weapon can deliver before 
                             it breaks.

---------------
Elemental Stats
---------------
-Fire (Fe) = How high the Fire rating is on your weapon. Use Fire to 
             damage Ice Monsters.
-Ice (Ic) = How high the Ice rating is on your weapon. Use Ice to 
            damage Fire Monsters.
-Thunder (Th) = How high the Thunder rating is on your weapon. Use 
                Thunder to damage Wind Monsters.
-Wind (Wi) = How high the Wind rating is on your weapon. Use Wind to 
             damage Thunder Monsters.
-Holy (Ho) = How high the Holy rating is on your weapon. Use Holy to 
             damage the Undead, Mummies, and Evil Monsters.

-----------
Anti. Stats
-----------
-Dragon (Dr) = Increases damage done to reptilian monsters.
-Undead (Ud) = Increases damage done to the undead.
-Marine (Ma) = Increases damage done to marine monsters.
-Rock (Rk)   = Increases damage done to rock monsters.
-Plant (Pt)  = Increases damage done to plant monsters.
-Beast (Bt)  = Increases damage done to animal monsters.
-Sky (Sy)    = Increases damage done to flying monsters.
-Metal (Ml)  = Increases damage done to metal monsters.
-Mimic (Mc)  = Increases damage done to Mimics and King Mimics.
-Mage (Mg)   = Increases damage done to mages and witches.

So, using this information and your own common sense you can find the 
easiest way to defeat every monster in Dark Cloud.

-------------------
*****Abilities*****        
-------------------
Some weapons in Dark Cloud carry abilities on them that can make the 
over all dungeon experience easier and more rewarding, and then there 
are a few that make it harder and less rewarding, you'll want to stay 
away from these. Also there are some abilities that cancel each other 
out. In this section you will find out all about the abilities and how 
to obtain them.

First the list of all the abilities and a description of what they do.

-Quench = It makes the overall process of getting thirsty in a dungeon 
          slower. It is the opposite of Thirst.

-Thirst = It makes the overall process of getting thirsty in a dungeon 
          faster, but every time you kill an enemy you get a drop of water on 
          your thirst meter refilled. It is the opposite of Quench.

-Big Bucks = Whenever you kill an enemy that drops gilda with a weapon 
             that has Big Bucks on it the amount of gilda it drops will be 
             greater. It is the opposite of Poor.

-Poor = Whenever you kill an enemy that drops gilda with a weapon that 
        has Poor on it the amount of gilda it drops will be less. It is 
        the opposite of Big Bucks.

-Durable = It makes the WHP lost per hit / shot less. It is the 
           opposite of Fragile.

-Fragile = It makes the WHP lost per hit / shot greater. It is the 
           opposite of Durable.

-Drain = Every time you hit / shoot an enemy you receive a portion of 
         the damage dealt to heal yourself. It is the opposite of Heal.

-Heal = You gain 1 HP once every couple of seconds. It is the opposite 
        of Drain.

-Steal = When hitting / shooting an enemy with a weapon that has the 
         Steal ability it is possible to steal items from them.

-Stop = A weapon that possesses this ability can sometimes stop an 
        enemy dead in its tracks the same way a Throbbing Cherry can.

-Poison = A weapon that possesses this ability can sometimes poison an 
          enemy the same way a Poisonous Apple can.

-Critical = A weapon that possesses this ability has the chance to kill 
            an enemy in one blow.

-Abs Up = It multiplies the Abs received from defeating an enemy by 
          1.5.

This is a list of the weapons that carry these abilities:

-Ability       Weapon             Character

-Quench        Kitchen Knife        Toan
-Thirst        Sand Breaker         Toan
-Big Bucks     Big Bucks Hammer     Goro
-Poor          Trial Hammer         Goro
-Drain         Drain Seeker         Toan
-Heal          Angel Shooter        Xiao
-Steal         Bandit Slingshot     Xiao
-Steal         Bandit's Ring        Ruby
-Stop          Antique Sword        Toan
-Poison        Scorpion             Ungaga
-Critical      5 Foot Nail          Ungaga
-Abs Up        Trial Hammer         Goro

The abilities Durable and Fragile are random. They can be on any weapon 
that you buy or find, so it doesn't really do you any good if I told 
you what weapons I have found them on, as if you found that weapon the 
chances are it would not be on it. Good luck finding Durable!

Note: Synths are not character specific. You can have a synth from a
weapon for Ruby and attach it onto a weapon for Toan, as an example.
This means all you people that want all the good abilites on one weapon,
you are in luck, as you can do that. However you can't have both Drain
and Heal as they are opposites. You can have at most nine abilities on
a weapon.

---------------------------
****Canceling Abilities****
---------------------------
Ok so the abilities that cancel each other out, or opposites as they 
are commonly called are:

Quench - Thirst
Big Bucks - Poor
Durable - Fragile
Drain - Heal

Canceling out abilities can be confusing for some people, so I will 
explain it as simple as I can. Now lets say you want Abs Up on your 
weapon, but you don't want Poor, which comes with Abs Up on the Trial 
Hammer. To get rid of Poor you must put the Trial Hammer synth onto a 
weapon that already has Big Bucks. Now, when you put it on, both Big 
Bucks and Poor will disappear as they cancel each other out, leaving 
Abs Up on instead. But, after you officially absorb the synth of the 
Trial Hammer, in other words upgrade with it on, Big Bucks will 
reappear and Abs Up will still be on the weapon. So basically it is 
like this: Whenever canceling out abilities, with the corresponding 
opposite, the one that was on the weapon in the first place will stay 
and the one on the synth will disappear after the upgrade.

-------------
***Durable***
-------------
Finding Durable can be a difficult thing to do. However over the past
couple years at the Help Centers I have had two individuals come to me
with brillant ways of getting this ability. Their ways are the same, at
the core, but they explained them differently. I'll give you their
explanations and then sum it up in my own words. The words under their
headings are their own, and I have not altered them.

---------------
Lee Eric Kirwan
---------------
No weapon consistently has durable. In other words,
a particular weapon can have durable, but not always
have it.

I decided to buy and sell weapons alot out of
randomness, and it seems that quick buying doesn't
'refresh' a weapon you buy. What I mean is, when I
was quick buying kitchen knives, I didn't get any
durable through over 40 knives, then I normally
bought a knife out of randomness, and then quick
bought the rest of the 8, and found the 8 I quick
bought all had durable... I believe the quickest
way of getting durable, at a large cost of gilda,
is to drag kitchen knives from the shop to your
inventory, check it out, repeat until your weapon
inventory for Toan is full, check the weapons, sell
any that doesn't have durable (quick sell if you like),
then normally buy the knives again. If you don't want
quench along with durable, then use the slightly more
expensive gladius.

If you'd like to know, I did normally buy (not using
[triangle] to quick buy) 16 gladius before getting two
of them with durable. I'm not sure if any weapons
would get durable more often than others, though...

Anyway, I'll try telling about what I did in greater
detail... As I said, quick buying doesn't refresh,
so I did get 8 knives in a row with durable and
quench, but I didn't mention that when I was buying
a bunch of gladius', I was buying one at a time,
normally, then backing out after one purchase, checking,
then going back into shop to trade a gladius for another
gladius. This was for the first 11 gladius of the 16 I
mentioned. Then, at the last five, I just bought them
without leaving the shop, and the second and fourth ones
I bought that time had durable. I wonder if it is truly
refreshed, or if it cycles between two gladius', where
both are randomly determined, each time you look at what
the shop has... Just speculating...
I also wonder, if each time you visit the shop, the first
weapon you buy would ever get Durable...

Expert - I made an interesting discovery, and as this will probably
be my last post on this board I thought I'd tell you so that you can
pass it on to anyone else who needs to know in the future as you
most frequently answer people's questions. Anyway, do you
remember that I was trying to get durable weapons by buying a
lot of cheap weapons? Well, it turns out that if you buy multiple
weapons of the same type at one time using the triangle button to
quick buy, then the game considers all of these weapons to be
identical in terms of their random abilities. In other words, I was
buying 4 kitchen knifes and 4 gladius swords at a time, and I
bought 4 gladius at the same time which ALL had the durable ability.
The random abilities are assigned before you even buy the sword
instead they are assigned when you go into the shopping screen.
Therefore, you can get multiple durable weapons all at once if you
use the quick buy feature and are moderately lucky and patient.

--------
My Words
--------
Here is a way that others have found useful in getting Durable.
This has my own twist on it of course.
-Get a lot of Gilda.
-Save the game in Queens.
-Go to Jack's Weapon Shop.
-Ok this is where it gets a bit complicated. I'll try to explain it:
 When you Quick Buy weapons they are all exactly the same. So, we
 can take advantage of this. If you Quick Buy X amount of Kitchen
 Knives and the first one had Durable then all of the others will
 also have Durable. So, simply go in and quick buy Kitchen Knives.
 When you can't carry any more exit out of the shop and check their
 status. If they have Durable then you are all set. If they don't
 go to the next step.
-Now you have some options. You can reset or you can keep going
 back into the shop and quick buying and selling until you have
 no more money left. The choice is yours.
-Stop when you are satisfied with the results.

Don't forget, there is the old fashion way of finding Durable:
Go out there and look!

-------------------------------
***Stopping Default Abilites***
-------------------------------
There are some weapons out there that come with abilities that you
just are not going to want. However, if you go with certain weapon
paths then you will defaultly get certain abilities on you weapons.
Now, this can create a problem. Where this is most evident is
undoubtedly the Angel Shooter with Heal. See the Angel Shooter is
the only weapon that evolves directly into the Angel Gear which
is Xiao's best ultimate weapon. Now, while Heal is considered a
"Good" ability it really doesn't hold a candle to Drain, it's
counterpart. So, for the people that want to make everything on
her weapon as good as possible you will need to find a way for the
Angel Shooter not to gain Heal. (This happens when you evolved into
it from a Divine Beast Title.) For a while now I have had a hypothosis
on how to do this, and it was indeed confirmed not to long ago by
an avid Dark Cloud player, Lee Eric Kirwan. Here are his words on
the situation:

---------------
Lee Eric Kirwan
---------------
Also, having Drain on a Divine Beast Title as you Build it Up to an
Angel Shooter becomes a weapon with nether Heal or Drain. Tossing in
an extra Powerup Powder shows the Heal ability stays away.

So, I suppose that you can have an Angel Gear with Drain. I just
decided to toss a few powerful Synthspheres and Powerup Powders
into a Matador, and check the result. Seems Ange Gear doesn't
redundantly have Heal, so you're just wasting one Drain for a
heal-less Angel Gear.

--------
My Words
--------
In order to keep the weapon you are evolving into from having it's
default ability simply have the opposite of that ability on before
you build up into the weapon. However this also brings up the point
that if you can't evolve into the weapon you are simply stuck with
the abilites it comes with. If you find weapons with bad abilites,
just sell them. In the case of the Trial Hammer see the section
above on Canceling Out Abilites. Now, there is no drawback to having
the abilities with no opposite, as they are all good to have anyway.
This includes: Steal, Stop, Poision, Critical, and Abs Up. So, now
we are left with the abilities: Quench/Thirst, Big Bucks/Poor
Drain/Heal. My advice is to refer to the section about once again
for the Trial Hammer and it's Poor/Abs Up mix. Also I would say
to just avoid the Sand Breaker and Thirst, unless you like that
ability better than Quench, and some people do. (See the descriptions
of the abilities above.) Besides, although the Sand Breaker evolves
into the Antique Sword which has Stop, you will find more than
enough Antique Sword without evolution. That leaves us with Drain/Heal.
Drain is better, it just is. Heal is only on Xiao's Angel Shooter as
I said before. This means that it is in your way of an Angel Gear
with Drain. So to fix it: Just make sure that before you have your
Divine Beast Title evolve into an Angel Shooter, it already has
Drain on it. This will have a nulling affect on the Angel Shooter's
defualt Heal ability and leave you with a neutral weapon. Then
whenever another Drain Seeker (The weapon with Drain.) is provided
for you then just put that on the Angel Shooter/Gear to have a great
slingshot without Heal, making it that much better!

---------------------------------------
*****Finding Weapons With Abilites*****
---------------------------------------
It’s pretty random where you find any weapon, let alone weapons
with abilities, but here is a list where I would suggest searching
for them.

-Kitchen Knife - Buy from Jack in Queens.
-Antique Sword - Demon Shaft / Gallery of Time
-Drain Seeker - Demon Shaft / Gallery of Time
-Bandit Slingshot - Anywhere after Floor 8 of the Divine Beast Cave.
-Big Bucks Hammer - Buy from Jack in Queens.
-Trial Hammer - Wise Owl Forest Floors after 9 and Shipwreck Floors before 9.
-Bandit's Ring - Anywhere after Floor 9 of the Shipwreck.
-5 ft. Nail - Anywhere after Floor 9 of the Sun & Moon Temple and before
 Floor 8 of the Moon Sea.
-Scorpion - Anywhere after Floor 9 of the Sun & Moon Temple.

The places with the highest percentage to find weapons for a certain
character are the levels after you get them up to the levels where you
get the next character. However, some weapons, like the Drain Seeker
for example are too powerful to find in the first 7 levels of the
Divine Beast Cave, so I put where I tend to find the most of them.

Also, weapons with Durable can be anywhere because there is no set weapon
that always has Durable. However, do remember, it tends to be very rare!

-------------------
*****Evolution*****
-------------------

In Dark Cloud your weapons, after they get strong enough can evolve 
into more powerful forms. This section will show you the evolution 
paths that weapons can take in this game. If a weapon can evolve into 
more than one form the one that is listed in the second slot under 
Build Up in the game will be listed second. At the end of every 
characters evolution chart I will list the final weapons in 
alphabetical order, showing the max attack then on the other side 
of the dash the max magic. If you want to see the max attack and 
magic for all the weapons go to the Max Attack / Magic section 
later in the guide. Well, here it goes.

-------------------------

Brave Ark       - Dark Cloud
Cross Hinder    - Big Bang
Drain Seeker    - Dark Cloud
Heaven's Cloud  - Dark Cloud
Lamb's Sword    - Atlamilla Sword
Maneater        - Atlamilla Sword
Mardan Eins     - Mardan Twei
Sun Sword       - Big Bang

Atlamilla Sword - Chronicle Sword
Big Bang        - Sword Of Zeus
Dark Cloud      - 7th Heaven
Mardan Twei     - Arise Mardan

Final Weapons

7th Heaven      - 240 / 110
Arise Mardan    - 250 / 120
Chronicle 2     - 350 / 200
Chronicle Sword - 260 / 150
Sword Of Zeus   - 199 / 176

Notes: There are only one Serpent Sword, Macho Sword, Sun Sword, Mardan 
Enis and Chronicle 2 in the game. That means there is only one Aga's 
Sword as the Macho Sword is the only weapon that evolves into Aga's 
Sword. There are also only one Mardan Twei and Arise Mardan because 
there is only one Mardan Eins.

Notes: To get the Chronicle 2 you must beat the Black Knight Pendragon 
on the 100th floor of the Demon Shaft.

Notes: The only way to get a Mardan Eins is to catch a Mardan Garyan, 
and then you have to buy it for 2500 fishing points. To build it up to 
Mardan Twei you have to catch 25 more Mardans and then to build the 
Mardan Twei up to the Arise Mardan you need to catch 15 more Mardans.
I have been told that these figures, according to other people may be
too high, but these are the ones I will list until they are officially
proven wrong as I would rather have you shoot too high and be given
a suprise than shoot too low and get angry. There are also other theories
of how these blades Build Up, but this is the most commonly accepted
idea and will be listed until it's officially wrong.

Notes: The Lamb's Sword changes its appearance and stats when it goes 
into "Wolf Mode". It does this when it gets low on WHP.

Notes: Evolving the Serpent Sword into the Tsukikage could end up
loosing you 2 Attack. The max Attack for the Serpent Sword is 70
and for the Tsukikage it is 68.

Osmond's Guns
-------------
[-Base Weapon - Machine Gun-]

Jackal       - Blessing Gun / Swallow
Snail        - Blessing Gun / Hexa Blaster

Blessing Gun - Skunk
Swallow      - G Crusher

Skunk        - Hexa Blaster

Hexa Blaster - Supernova
G Crusher    - Star Breaker

Final Weapons

Star Breaker - 120 / 45
Supernova    - 256 / 128

Note: Osmond has two main weapon types, the machine guns and the laser 
guns. There is also a third group, the flamethrower type, but these 
eventually turn into a laser type anyway. The machine guns include: 
Jackal, Swallow, G Crusher and the final machine gun, the Star Breaker. 
The laser guns include:  Snail, Hexa Blaster and the final laser gun, 
the Supernova. The flamethrower types are the Blessing Gun and the 
Skunk. The machine gun types have lower max stats than the laser guns, 
but make up for it with a faster rate of fire. That would explain why 
the Star Breaker, an ultimate weapon has lower max stats then the Hexa 
Blaster, which isn't even an ultimate weapon.

Notes: Evolving the Snail into the Blessing Gun could end up
loosing you 9 Attack. The max Attack for the Snail is 65
and for the Blessing Gun it is 56.

Notes: Evolving the Snail into the Blessing Gun could end up
loosing you 25 Magic. The max Magic for the Snail is 55
and for the Blessing Gun it is 30.

*****Stats*****
---------------
In this section you can find all the starting stats for the weapons you 
can obtain in any ways besides evolution in Dark Cloud. You can also use 
these stats to figure out how to build up to one of these weapons.
However, in the cases of some of the weapons, the stats listed here and
the stats required to reach that weapon through evolution vary. So, to
use this section the best, use it more as an outline, not as a 100%
accurate graph. The  weapons are listed in the order in which they
appear on the evolution chart.

*****Locations*****
--------------------

Well, this section contains the locations of the weapons in the game. For
every character the display will be a little different, as some characters
can only get weapons in certain dugeons. If I list a dungeon that I have 
found it in it could have been obtained through a regular Treasure Chest 
or from a Happpy Clown. If I haven't found a weapon in a ceratin dungeon or 
just don't remember it, as I only recorded locations on one of my six games, 
I will just leave a blank. It doesn't mean you can't find it there. It will 
be in the same order as everything else, the evolution order. Also if I have 
it as a gift or buyable, look in the corrosponding sections to get a more 
detailed description on its where abouts. Here it goes.

*****Top Stat Synths*****

Have you ever needed a lot of one stat to get that weapon to the next build
and you knew a gem wouldn't cut it? Then go with a synth sphere. This section
contains the weapons that has the highest base stat in evey catagory. NOTE:
The Chronicle 2 is not included in the rankings for highest stats because I
would never recomend making it into a synth sphere. The top three are listed,
but if there is a tie then more will be listed.

*****Leveling Up Tips*****
--------------------------

This section just contains tips you can use to help you to become better
at managing your weapons.

1.) Making Synths / Build Up Weak Weapons
Let's face it, when you have a weak weapon or are trying to make
a Synth Sphere you don't want to go back to an easier dungeon
just to do so. So, what are you to do? The answer is share the
Abs. This is a simple trick with not to many rules. The basic
idea is this: Kill an enemy. Now before the enemy fades away press
Triangle and switch to the weapon you want to get the Abs. Now
exit out and when then the enemy fades away the weapon that is now
equiped will get the Abs instead of the weapon that killed it. Now
go back and equip your strong weapon again and repeat the process
until you have a Synthable weapon or the weapon is strong enough
for you to use to defend yourself. Now there are two things that
you should know. First the bad: You can't switch chracters. The
Abs won't transfer if you kill it with Toan and switch to Ungaga,
or any character set up for that matter. However, with this you
can just make a synth with a good character and put it on a weaker
one anyway. The second thing is good: If you have the special Abs
Up on the weapon that kills the monster the weapon you actually
gets the Abs will still reap those benifits. Cool huh?!? Ok, well
this is the easist way to upgrade weapons you don't really want
to use.

2.) Building Your Main Weapon
When leveling up your main weapon you should really only use
Synth Spheres and Gems. In some odd cases you will use regular
attachments. These cases would include: The stat is 6 or less away
from being maxed out, or you know you only need 6 or less in a
stat in order for it to be ready for the next upgrade. Other than
these times you should only use Synth Spheres and Gems on you main
weapon. Your main weapon is, your stongest weapon for a character
that you will be building up and evolving for use in much of the
game. Now you may ask what am I to do in the begining of the game
when I don't have enough Gems to fill up all my attachment slots?
Well that is when, just like anytime in the game, you make Synth
Spheres. Just take a decent weapon and upgrade it to +5. Now along
the way you can put on regular attachments on this weapon, but it's
usually only worth it if the weapon already had a decent base for
that stat already, such as putting Anti-Marine attachments on a
Kitchen Knife as it's Anti-Marine base is already 33. Now, when
you have a synth, just get some gems and absorb them all onto
your main weapon and then use it again until you have full Abs
and are ready to repeat the Synth Sphere Makeing/Gem Gathering
Process. Useing this method makes for the least amount of time
you have to put into a weapon because the attacments you are
using are all much better than regular ones. With the proper
Synth Spheres and Gem selection you can get to the next build
for any weapon in 7 levels or less.

3.) Where Should I Level Up?
There are a few good places that really stand out when it comes
to leveling up your weapon. One is of course the bonus dungeon
the Demon Shaft. The last 20 levels in this place provide a very
good Ab flow, not to mention the fact that the  backfloor key;
Crystal Eyeball is very common. This is a good place to level
up on your second+ game as it becomes availble right when you
get to Dark Heaven Castle. However, on your first game if you
want to level up before the Final Battle the Gallery Of Time
works well also. Try doing the later floors of course. However,
my favorite place to level up is the Shipwreck Floor 14, the
Backfloor. Why? For one you can buy the backfloor key; Flapping
Fish and an Ice Block to keep it fresh from Ruty of Queens for
a combined cost of 200 Gilda. Now once in the back you have Masks
that are super easy to defeat that give 24 Abs each. Also there
is always the chance of getting Gems and maybe some Power Up
Powders. And if you want more bang for your buck just leave and
go back in. The enemys will have respawned. Of course collecting
the Treasure in the front is also recomended. Also Floor 10 of
the Wise Owl Forest is a great place also, it's just that the
backfloor key for that place is not super common or buyable so
I would still recomend the Shipwreck. Ok, all these areas are top
notch places to level up your weapons! 


Recently I got a suggestion from camster about putting in places
to level up in that are not just the "super" areas but in more
areas, even the Divine Beast Cave. So, here is a list of the best
places to level up in every dungeon in the game:

--Divine Beast Cave--
Front: #11 & #13 = 57 Abs
Back: #12 = 64 Abs

--Wise Owl Forest--
Front: #16 = 105 Abs
Back: #10 = 192 Abs

--Shipwreck--
Front: #17 = 155 Abs
Back: #14 = 192 Abs

--Sun And Moon Temple--
Front: #17 = 174 Abs
Back: #5 & #17 = 192 Abs

--Moon Sea--
Front: #14 = 191 Abs
Back: #11 = 240 Abs

--Gallery Of Time--
Front: 225 Years Ago = 237 Abs
Back: The Back Floor Key to the Gallery of Time is the
Flapping Duster. However, in the American version of the
game you won’t find it. Unfortunately when they were translating
the game and all that good stuff it was accidentally left out.
On the plus side, we did get the Demon Shaft and the Japanese
did not. As a side note, I hear you can get the Flapping Duster
with a GameShark or a similar device. I don’t have one of these
myself, but that is what I hear.

--Demon Shaft--
Front: #81, #84, #88, #89, #92, #93, #94, #95 = 525 Abs
Back: #81-#99 =  ~ 531 Abs

Like I described in the paragraph above however, these are the 3 I
would choose above all else:

--Shipwreck--
Back: #14 = 192 Abs
(It Has A Buyable Back Floor Key)  

--Demon Shaft--
Front: #81, #84, #88, #89, #92, #93, #94, #95 = 525 Abs
Back: #81-#99 = They have an average of 531 Abs
(It Has A Very Common Back Floor Key)

--Wise Owl Forest--
Back: #10 = 192 Abs
(It Has A Fairly Common Back Floor Key) 


This is a contribution from Lufusol, regarding the back floor
of Level 17 of the Sun & Moon Temple. It is taken straight
from his email, so is in his own words:

--------------------------------------------------------
Hi Andrew,

First I want to thank you for your helpful FAQ.  I
have a comment regarding the "Where Should I Level
Up?" section.  I think Level 17 of the Sun & Moon
Temple deserves MUCH more notice as a great place to
level, --as long as you have a fairly powerful
synthsphere with the "steal" ability--:

1) As your FAQ already mentions, the enemies give
great ABS in both front and back rooms.

2) You don't need to bring repair powders - Steel
Golems provide them (via stealing), and the front room
is full of them.

3) You don't need to bring water or food.  There is
almost always a pool in the front map (or both!).  If
someone gets hurt just switch allies until you can
reach the health spot.  Check the map for a pool
before wasting a key on the back room - once you use
it you can stay down there literally for hours.  

3) It's easy to beat the slow monsters within an inch
of their lives with Xiao, Ruby or Osmond (having the
synthsphere+steal equipped) and then switch weapons
(or characters) to finish the job and collect tons of
ABS.  

In the back room, Xiao or Osmond are best because the
blue dragons rarely shoot ice at these characters, but
for some reason they shoot constantly at Ruby.

4) You will steal tons of ice gems from the Blue
Dragons, and can use them to get various Breaker
attachments (stone, metal, dragon, and mimic I
believe) right there on the same level.

The only thing you need to bring are lots of Dran's
Feathers (atleast 6!) and other attachment items.  It
gets very tedious if you can't run around quickly.

Please consider noting this in your FAQ... I have made
a lot of progress in a (relatively) short time from
this one level, even though the keys are rare.

Again, thanks a lot, your FAQ has been an invaluable
reference for upgrading!
--------------------------------------------------------

4.) Take Care Of Your Weapons!
This is the easiest thing to do: Use at least 1 of your Active
Items slots as a place to put an Auto-Repair Powder. Although
you should be using a regular one when your weapon gets to
12-20 WHP left, this is just a safe fall back incase you forget.
I think you would rather have it there than loose your Chronicle
Sword you have spent hours upgrading dissapear beofore your eyes,
wouldn't you?!? I think so.

Also all default weapons CAN break and when they do their stats
reset to the starting ones. They can break, they just don't
disappear. The Serpent Sword, after the dual with the Killer
Snake is breakable.

Like I said though, lucky for you, and every other Dark Cloud
player they have items called Repair Powders and more importantly
Auto-Repair Powders! So, in order to keep your Weapons safe just
follow this mini-guide:

-Set an Auto-Repair Powder as an Active Item.
-Then make sure you have an extra or two in your Item Bag.
-Now, make sure you have 2-5 Repair Powders with you are all times.
-Try as hard as you can to use a normal Repair Powder when
your weapon gets to 20-12 WHP depending on the monsters you
are fighting and your weapons Durability.
-You can do it, I believe in you!

************************************Attachments****************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you just upgrade a weapon without attachements on it won't get much
stronger. You need attachments on in order to upgrade it's stats so
you can build it up to the next form. This sections purpose is to tell
you all about the attahments in Dark Cloud

*****Buying*****
----------------

This is a listing of where you can buy attachments in Dark Cloud.
The shops are listed in which area they are located, going by the 
order you get to them in the game. Also listed is the price at which
you can buy the attachment. Some shops don't have attachments, so 
they will just be skipped. Remember that the attachments you can buy 
at fishing spots are bought with Fishing Points, not Gilda. This has
mainly been taken from my Items Guide also, just I only put in the
information about attachments.


-------------------------------
Gaffer's Buggy - Norune Village
-------------------------------
-This is what Gaffer will sell if you have Pike in his house when you
go to the ending event for Gaffer's Buggy.

-Attack 1  -300
-Endurance 1 - 260
-Fire - 300
-Ice - 300
-Thunder - 300
-Wind - 300
-Holy - 300
-Dragon Slayer - 300

-If you have the other version of Gaffer's Buggy then he doesn't sell
any attachments.

--------------------------------
Wise Owl Shop - Matataki Village
--------------------------------
-Plant Buster - 300

---------------------
Suzy's Store - Queens
---------------------
-Suzy's Store - To get this name when she says, " The name Suzy's, 
it's not quite right is it?" Choose "Is it?" as your response and she 
will keep the name Suzy's Store.

-This version of Suzy's Store does not sell attachments. But I would
still pick it. Why? To answer this I will use an exert from my Items
Guide:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
***I would choose this as the name you want because after Rando 
leaves then this would be the only shop that sells Holy Water. While 
Holy Water might not seem so great, the other 3 choices for the store 
name will all result in having items for sale that you can buy in 
other places. So even though it is only Holy Water it is still one 
more different item that you can buy. One more thing is that in no 
matter what one of the 4 you choose they will all have the 3 waters 
and the Stamina Drink and no other shop sells the Stamina Drink.***

***Receiving From Enemies***
----------------------------

This section was suggested by DeMatt. He said that he found it
usefull getting attachments through using Items to kill enemies.
Now, if you have read the Leveling Up section you know that I
personally look down on using Regular Attachments most of the
time. (Please note that I am NOT saying that DeMatt frequently
uses regular attachments.) However, in those rare cases where
I do use Regular Attachments, which you can see in the Leveling
Up Tips section it's nice to have the right kind availible.
Although I always have enough money to just buy them, there are
the two: Metal and Mimic which can only be bought with Fising
Points, and I don't condone using Fishing Points to buy
anything other than Gems and the Mardan Eins. So, how do you get
these attachments? Well, as the title says you receive them from
enemies. But in order to do this you need to defeat them with
an item. Now, the item only needs to strick the final blow, it
does not need to do all the damage, so if you want you can lower
it's health by other means such as Posion or direct weapon damage.
Anyway, if you finish the monseter off with an Item it will most
of the time, not all of the time, drop an Attachment. So, basically
this section is going to describe the easiest way to get these
attachments. I've picked the easiest enemy that gives each one,
so although there are more than likely more, these are the monsters
that I feel are the easiest to defeat.

Dragon Slayer = Dragon = Divine Beast Cave
Undead Buster = Skeleton Soldier = Divine Beast Cave
Sea Killer = Opar = Divine Beast Cave
Stone Breaker = Statue = Divine Beast Cave
Plant Buster = Canibal Plant = Wise Owl Forest
Beast Buster = Dasher = Divine Beast Cave
Sky Hunter = Crescent Baron = Moon Sea
Metal Breaker = Pirate's Chariot = Shipwreck
Mimic Breaker = Mimic = Divine Beast Cave
Mage Slayer = Sunday (& Friends) = Wise Owl Forest

Just as a side note: Running through the Divine Beast Cave's first couple
floors and using your projectiles is a good way to make Gilda. You will
get more money for selling Attachment than Bombs and such and even if
you use some and don't get and attachment you will still make a profit
in the long run.

*****Ending Remarks*****
------------------------

If you have any information I forgot you can send it to the email 
listed at the top of the guide. Put the subject as Dark Cloud, that way I 
will read it faster. Also if I made any mistakes you can do the same thing. 
You will get credit for the information you submit if I put it in the guide. 
Also if there is anything you want to see in the guide that's related to 
weapons then feel free to send me your ideas. I am thinking about putting
in a Full Profile section for weapons that has all the information from
the previous sections about a weapon all in one place. If you would like
to see this or anything relating to weapons in Dark Cloud send me an email.
Well, thanks for reading it, I hope it helped.
