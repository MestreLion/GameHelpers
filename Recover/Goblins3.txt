In the town use the Speedixir on Blount to make him run faster. Give the baby
Boucassier some Growlixir. To get to the bell, use Fulbert like a plank. Use
the bird decoy on the bell and the female Boucassier appears. Position Fulbert
over the gap. Run and tap Boucassier's shoulders then immediately run down

tuft of hair.

Problem:
How can I return Ooya to the meteorologist's island?
Hint:
Add a sand bag to the basket of the big balloon. Using the knife, cut a sand
bag from the ballast to knock out the goat. Inflate another balloon with the
pump then hurry to the cloud. Wait until the balloon is within Ooya's reach to
grab it. If the balloon drops Ooya in the wrong place, Ooya can hit the stone
and build a bridge back to the island so he can try again. Use the knife on the
cloud over the Giant while Ooya is holding the balloon. The giant sneezes,
blowing Ooya toward the geysers. Timing is very important. Position Ooya on the
extinct geyser in the center. Use Blount to block the lower geyser. Ooya is
thrown to the island of the meteorologist.

Problem:
How can I get Ooya to the glacier?
Hint:
Cut sand bags from the balloon until Ooya can get into it from the upper ledge.

Hint:
Position Ooya on the shovel and use the buttons to swivel the catapult to the
front. Use the big telescope on top of the tower to make Colossus activate the
catapult. Ooya should land by the cheese. Use Ooya on the cheese and a worm
will come out of it. Walk Ooya to the left to get him off the island. Swivel
the catapult to the center position. Position Blount on the shovel until he
lands on the catapult. Use Ooya to swivel catapult to right. Use Ooya to click
on the ship painting above Colossus to activate the catapult. Have Blount use
the fishing rod on the worm in the cheese.

Problem:
What can I go fishing for with the worm and the pole?
Hint:
In the Clouds you can use the fishing pole on the hole in the clouds to get a
sawfish.

using the other button. Swivel the catapult to the left and fire it by using
the telescope. The rock is thrown at Colossus and knocks off his helmet. Put
Bizoo on Colossus's face.

Problem:
What should I do to Colossus' face?
Hint:
Enter the mouth through a tooth to get the toothpick. Put the toothpick on his
right eye lid. Look in left eye. Go through his right ear to remove the grain
of sand. Pull on a nose hair to get a tear from the left eye. Throw the grain
of sand on the tear. Get the toothpick.

Problem:

tear by pulling the nose hair. Place Bizoo on it to cross the barrier of hair.
Click on the grain of sand to kick it off Colossus.

Problem:
What do I do with the grain of sand?
Hint:
Use the sawfish to saw the base of the right column holding Colossus's hammock.
Use Ooya on Blount in the cage to detach his shadow. The shadow can then pick
up the grain of sand. Put it in the catapult machine and use Ooya on the ship
painting to activate the machine. Pick up the gearing that flies out of the
catapult. Using the knife, open up the robot by Fourbalus. Put the gearing into
the robot. Take the pollen that the robot expels. Place the piece of pollen on
Colossus's face.

Problem:
What do I do with the piece of pollen?
Hint:
Jump on Colossus's nose. When the hand gets close to the nose, walk back down
to the nose. Pick up the fleck of pollen off the head band. Put the toothpick
in the left nostril. Put the pollen in his left ear. Jump on his left collar to
push the pollen through.

wand on the candle to light it. Blount's shadow appears and pronounces a
portion of a sentence. Move and light the candle in proper order to form a
sentence. Don't interrupt the sequence in any way. The logical order of the
sentence is "I, the shadow of the fountain, order the opening of the passage
that leads to Bodd." The mouth of the fountain opens. Enter through the
opening.

Problem:
What do I do in King Bodd's throne room?
Hint:

mantel. Give the fennel to the guard on the left. His spear straightens. Use

fireplace hearth. When all of the characters appear, send Fulbert up the candle
holder. The cook throws the ax and cuts the rope on the skull. Keep repeating
if the cook misses. When the skull falls pick it up. Go through the fountain.

What do I do with the dragon decoy?
Hint:
Send Blount down the well and through the door. Use the Growlixir on the plant
near the window. Use Fulbert to climb the plant to create a step. Have Blount
go to the window and use the dragon decoy on the window opening to call the
dragon. Give the dragon some Growlixir. Use the decoy on the fence and the
dragon will burn it. Move Blount through the door near the lake. Use the dragon
decoy on the dream puddle to dry it up. Pick up the key.

Problem:
What do I do with the key?
Hint:
Move Blount through the door. Use the key to open the box behind the fence and
take the beauty ointment. Have Blount ride the dragon to the monolith. Put the
fat chicken on the grains. Pick up the single piece of grain that remains. Have
Blount use the wagon to return to Hall of Mirrors.

Problem:
What do I do with the grain of madness?
Hint:
Return to the Hall of Mirrors. Throw the grain of madness on the Old Demon.
Take the concentrate of Ugliness with the Blount-reflection. Move both Blount
and his Reflection to the Mirror of Beauty. Move Blount close enough to see his
reflection in the mirror of beauty. Use the ointment of beauty on Blount. As
soon as Blount becomes good-looking, quickly switch to his Reflection. Use the
Ugliness extract on his Reflection. Both Blount and his Reflection will exit
automatically when you timed things correctly.

8 ... The Deities

Problem:
What do I do with the Deities?
Hint:
Talk to the Positive Pole to get the Thread of Time. Pick up the Thread of Time
from the ground. Break the wall at far right screen with the hammer. Break the
fence at far left screen with the ax. Ring the left doorbell and then as soon
as you have control, immediately ring the right doorbell. The hands will
stretch the chain across. Put Wolfy on the chain and have him pick up the
sacred score.

Problem:
What do I do with the sacred score?
Hint:
Dump the sacred score in the spring. Ring the bell on the left then the one on
the right. Move to the basin and when it is empty, jump into the basin to
recover the two scores.

Problem:
What do I do with the red and yellow scores?
Hint:
Put the red score on the demon's stand and the yellow score on the angel's
stand. Put the coin in the angel's halo on the ground. Hit the cloud with the
hammer to energize the demon's amplifier. Throw the thread of time on the two
notes that end up hovering above the basin. Ring both bells as quickly as
possible. When the timing is correct, the hands will tie the thread of time and
you will have restored harmony to the Kingdom!
