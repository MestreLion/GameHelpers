Indy 4 -- Fate of Atlantis Walkthrough for All 3 Modes

I am the first one to solve Indy 4 in all three mode. My total score (alsothe current high) is 938 out of 1000. Here is the complete walkthru.Thanks to Gerhard, he is the author of the first version. Thanks toTerence, he contributes to part of the solution of fists mode. If you find an alternative solution not listed here or if you are not properlycredited, e-mail to Gerhard(gwoeging@iaik.tu-graz.ac.at). He will fix them at the next version.
Comment of Indy 4: Highly recommended.

The animations in Indy 4 is the best of all currently available PC games(I think that contributes to their superior colour palette shifting technology). Better than Monkey Island II or the animation sequences in U7 and UW. The story line is fine. Most of the puzzles are well crafted. The game size is about one fifth of U7 but with much more animations. The ending animation are quite astonishing. I think it will be a classic. There are three modes. Each come with different puzzles and solutions. I recommend first try team mode because Sophia can give you some hints. Then you can try wits mode, it has several very interesting puzzles. Fists mode (action game) is optional because Indy 4 do not come with a good combat system (it is the same one in Indy 3). -- Allen Li

(A#) -- Alternative Solution


PART 1 (New York, Iceland, Tikali, Azores, College)
NEW YORK: Take the newspaper.
(A1) find your way through the crates on the backside of the building
(pushcrates) and use the fire escape.
(A2) talk to doorman, "smart", "easy to understand".
(A3) Fight doorman.
Give the paper to the stagehand, push the right and left lever and press the button. Talk to Sophia and leave together with her for Iceland. 

ICELAND: Talk to Heimdall; he tells you about Tikali and the Azores. 

TIKALI: Hit the jungle rodent several times with the whip, until it runs to the snake; use the tree. Talk to Sternhart until he asks you the name of Plato's lost dialogue. Tell him that you do not know the title. Then talk to the parrot, ask him "Title?" and talk again to Sternhart. Inside the pyramid, ask Sophia to keep Sternhart occupied. Go outside, take the lamp and open it. Use the lamp to get the spiral design in the pyramid. Then use the design with the animal head, pull it and open the grave. Sternhart gets away with the disk. Take the bead and return to Iceland. 

ICELAND: Use the bead in the eel's mouth; take the eel.

AZORES: Let Sophia first talk to Costa. Then trade him the eel for the knowledge of the position of the lost dialogue.
 
COLLEGE: There are three possibilities to find the collection (changes from game to game). (Case 1) Take the gum from the desk in the library, use it with the coal chute in the furnace room. Take the wax cat figurine and melt it in the furnace. (Case 2) Get the rag in the furnace room and the arrowhead in the room with the totem pole. Use the rag with the arrowhead to produce a screwdriver and open the bookcase in the library. (Case 3) Use the jar from the refrigerator in the office with the totem pole. Pull the totem pole under the hole in the ceiling and climb up. Open the urn and take the key. Push the crate in the totem pole-room and open the chest behind it. 

Talk to Sophia in the office and choose one of the three paths -- team,
wits, and fists.

*************************************************************************
PATH 1 -- TEAM MODE
===================

PART 2 (Algier, Monte Carlo)

ALGIER: Go to the shopkeeper in the back alley and take the mask. Talk to the man with the knives. Convince Sophia to volunteer for him and push her as she hesitates. You will receive a knife this way. 

MONTE CARLO: Talk to several people and ask them about Trottier. Sooner or later you will meet him (a man in a brown suit). Talk to him in a very polite and humble way till he is willing to take part in the seance. 

(A1:indy) During the seance take the flashlight from the cabinet and the bedsheet. Open the fuse box and use the circuit breaker. Wear the bedsheet, the mask and the flashlight to produce a reasonable ghost. 

(A2:sophia) When Indy talk to Trottier outside, take notes on what he said (they varied from game to game). After entering the room, transfer control to sophia. Demand proof. Answer three questions as Trottier just said. Answer a random number.(may need several save-and-restore here) This solution does not require the mask. 

Afterwards take the sunstone.

ALGIER: Talk again to the shopkeeper and show him the sunstone. He will give you a map and a couple of camels; your first visit to the desert fails. Next you have to trade several things with the shopkeeper and with the grocer; the final goal is to get the squab-on-a-stick for the mask. Give the squab to the beggar and receive a balloon ticket. Go to the roof, enter the balloon and cut the rope with the knife. 


*************************************************************************
PART 3 (Desert)

BALLOON RIDE: A kind of arcade game, since the up and down movements are coupled with movement in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. You will find out about this. You must land several times and ask nomads for the way to the X. 

DIG SITE: Sophia disappears into the hole. Climb down the ladder into the dark room, and get everything you can get: Sharp wood thing (ship rib), long tubular thing (hose), blunt wood thing (peg), clay thing (clay jar). At the truck you use the hose with the opened gas tank and the clay jar with the hose; this fills the jar with gas. Go back to the dark room, open the metal cap and pour the gas-filled jar into the gas filler pipe. Push the little metal thing to turn on the generator. Then dig the crumbling wall with the ship rib, put the peg into the mural and put the sunstone on the peg. Look at the sunstone: the lost dialogue tells to align "darkness" with the "horns"; do this and press the peg to open a secret door. Sophia comes out and gives you a distributor cap and a fish-on-a-string. Turn off the generator, open it and take the spark plug. Put the distributor cap and the spark plug into the truck's engine. Leave for Crete. 


**************************************************************************
PART 4 (Crete)

RUINS: First find the surveyor's instrument and take it. Pick up all stones around the tall horns; you will detect two statues (bull's head and tail). In one of the entrances, there is a mural diagram with a bull's head, horns and tail. According to this, put the surveyor's instrument on the head statue and look through it to the left horn. Then put it on the tail statue and look at the right horn. This gives you an X. Dig at the X with the ship rib and find the moonstone. Go to the stone pedestal and use the sun- and the moonstone with it. Align the disks according to the lost dialogue (changes from game to game), press the spindle and detect a secret door in the wall. 

CAVES: Pick up two of the three stone heads. Go through the door and get the third head with your whip. Find the room with the tall Minotaur statue. Use the whip with its head, and then stand to the left of the big head. The elevator takes you down to the dead Sternhart. Take the worldstone and the staff. Examine the waterfall and use the chain hidden behind it. Then find the room with the shelf and the closed door; open the door by putting the three stone heads onto the shelf. Go through the door and do three things. First, use the staff with the chock to free the counterweight. Secondly, use the staff in the statue's mouth to start the elevator. Thirdly, take the golden box, open it, put the two beads into it and close it again. 

Return to Sophia and enter the next room. Convince Sophia to let you boost her through the hole in order to open the gate. In the next room use the fish-on-a-string. It will point to Sophia's necklace. Talk to Sophia and make her put the necklace into the golden box. Walk through all rooms and use the fish-on-a-string. Somewhere it will point to the wall; dig this wall with the rib and open the door behind. Use all three disks with the spindle according to the lost dialogue. The Germans will kidnap Sophia and steal the disks. Dig the rocks with the rib and return to the surface. 


*************************************************************************
PART 5 (Submarine)

Open the hatch, fight against the captain and enter the submarine. Use the intercom to order "All hands to the bow". Go to the lower deck, take the mug of porcelain and fill it with battery acid. Talk to Sophia from the left neighbouring room through the window in the wall and ask her to distract the guard. Free Sophia and open the strong box with the help of the acid. Inside the box you find the three disks and a tiny key. Get the plunger. Unlock the emergency rudder control with the tiny key, break the lever in the conning tower and repair it with the plunger. Steer the submarine into the airlock (another fine(?) arcade game). 


*************************************************************************
PART 6 (Atlantis)

ENTRANCE: Find the wooden thing (ladder) in the dark and use it at the stone rubble. Sophia is kidnapped by the Germans again. Climb the ladder, open the stone thing and take the rod. Put a bead into the rod and light the room. Use the disks with the spindle according to the lost dialogue, but with north and south reversed (as "entrance is yielded only to contrary minds"). The statue's mouth will open, and you feed a bead into it. The door opens, you take the ladder and the three disks. Enter Atlantis. The exact position of the interesting rooms in Atlantis changes from game to game. Explore all shaded places (marked by a question mark), open and enter all grates. You must detect the following rooms and items. 

ROOM WITH ROBOT PARTS 1: Take the bronze gear attached to the wall.

ROOM WITH ROBOT PARTS 2: Take the bronze spoked wheel lying in the

ROOM WITH EEL-FIGURINE: Get the eel-figurine from the cupboard.

SUBWAY: At the most southern point, in the outer cycle. Take the rib cage from the skeleton.
HALLWAY: Fight against one of the German stooges (and defeat him). You will get a bratwurst. Bait the rip cage with the bratwurst (in case you took the sandwich from the kitchen in the submarine, you may bait the cage with the sandwich).

CRAB ROOM: Use the baited rip cage in the pool to catch a crab.

STATUE ROOM 1: Contains a statue that looks like a cross between a bull and a fish. Take the statue's head.

STATUE ROOM 2: Contains a large statue holding a cup. Use the ladder to cross the hole in the floor. Take the stone cup. Don't forget to take the ladder before leaving.

LAVA ROOM: Use the stone cup with the pedestal. Use the statue's head
with the plaque. This gives you a mug full of lava.

MACHINE ROOM: Repair the machine by putting the bronze spoked wheel onto the peg. Fill the mug with lava into the funnel. Take the produced beads and take the bronze spoked wheel before leaving. 

PRISON ROOM: In the room where Sophia is kept imprisoned there are two vents, one on the left side and one in the middle. The interesting vent is the left one. From there you can put a bead into the sentry statue; it will start moving, kill the German and destroy itself.

SENTRY ROOM: Contains three statues and a pool. To get rid of the water you put a bead into the eel. Then put a bead into the smallest statue's mouth. The door will open.

PRISON ROOM: Take the statue part from the destroyed statue. In order to free Sophia, you have to enter the canal system. 


*************************************************************************
PART 7 (The inner cycle)

CANAL: Feed the crab to the octopus. Enter the canal, go to the other side and put a bead into the crab mouth. The crab raft will start to float. Float to the left side, open the gates with the sun-, moon- or worldstone. There are only two interesting places in the canal system. One contains a cupboard with a crescent shaped gear. Take the gear, close the cupboard and look at it. You see a diagram with several wheels and moving arms. The other interesting place contains the large bronze statue and the chain. Use the ladder with the statue and open the chest plate. Look at the chest plate; you have to put the bronze gear, the bronze wheel, the statue part and the crescent gear into the right places, as described by the diagram on the cupboard (the wheel and the statue part belong onto the central peg). Make that the statue moves the right arm. Then fasten the chain to the statue arm and to the bronze loop. Make the statue to move its right arm back. The chain will break the door and a hinge pin comes off. Take the hinge pin and return to Sophia. PRISON: Give the hinge pin to Sophia. Open the cage. Sophia uses the pin and gets free. Open the cage a second time to get the pin. CANAL: Finally, you enter the inner cycle of Atlantis through the broken door. Sophia is getting crazy and leads you to a room with a lava pit. Look at Sophia, feed a bead to her necklace and use the box with the necklace. You get rid of Nur-Ab-Sal in the lava pit. Pick up the sceptre (near the skeletons). In the hall and near the hulking machine you see two Atlantean graffittis: One shows the lever positions to start the hulking machine (upward arrow), the other shows how to stop it. Use the hinge pin and the sceptre as levers in two slots. Feed a bead to the mouth. VOLCANIC AREA: Cross the area by trial and error. In the background, you see a picture of three concentric cycles: This picture encodes the positions of noon sun (sundisk), of full moon (moondisk) and of the volcano (worlddisk). In the central room with the frog statue and the spindle, align the three disks according to this picture. Now the Germans appear again. The first German is no problem, he will kill himself. Tell the second German that you are going to kill him as soon as you are a god. Thus you get rid of him, too, and finish the game.

A door is blocked with a big slab. Push it SEVERAL times. After pushing the stone slab covering the door proceed to beat up all the guards, with 2 exceptions. The first one, Hans, is too strong to beat, so hide behind a stone slab and when he comes by, push it over onto him. Also, Arnold is too strong to beat. Use the ship's rib to pry the boulder in the next room over so that it will roll onto him. When that doesn't work, go find a stalactite (on ceiling in another room) and pry the boulder from outside the doorway it's wedged in, that will take care of Arnold. Then look in the pit to find Sophia, search Arnold's body, and you have everything you need to get to Atlantis. The stories converges here.
