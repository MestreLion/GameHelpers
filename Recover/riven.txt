Ah... thank god you've returned... i need your help.
As a great deal of history as you should know, but i'm afraid i must continue my writing.
Here... most of what you'll need to know is in there. Keep it well hidden.
For a reason you will to discover, i can't send you to Riven with a way out.
But I can give you this:
It appears to be a linking book, back here to D'ni, but it is actually a one-man prision.
You'll need it, i'm afraid, to capture Khan.
Once you find Catherine, signal me, and i'll come with a linking book to bring you back.
There's also a chance, if this all goes well, that i might be able to get you back to the place that you came from.
