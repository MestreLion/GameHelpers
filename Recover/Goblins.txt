NOTE:  This is not "hints" for Goblins... It's a blunt walkthru for all
 22 levels.  Hit "n" now if you really don't want to  read all this.

The way I've organized this is with the level number, the passcode to load
up that particular level, the instructions to get you through it, and
underneath a line are things you can try that are REALLY funny, if you
either have health to spare, or a cheat TSR running.  If you find any errors,
please drop me a note at millernw@craft.camp.clarkson.edu  In the meantime,
enjoy!
