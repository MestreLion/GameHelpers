Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have started appearing with disturbing regularity in the night skies. Reports of violent human abductions and horrific experimentation has struck terror into the hearts of millions. Mass public hysteria has only served to expose Earth's impotence against a vastly superior technology.</p><p>Many countries have attempted to deal independently with the aliens. In August 1998, Japan established an anti alien combat force, the Kiryu Kai. Equipped with Japanese made fighter aircraft the Kiryu Kai certainly looked like a powerful force. However after 5 months of expensive operations they had yet to intercept their first UFO. The lesson was clear: this was a world-wide problem which could not be dealt with by individual countries.</p><p>On December 11th 1998, representatives from the world's most economically powerful countries gathered secretly in Geneva. After much debate the decision was made to establish a covert independent body to combat, investigate and defeat the alien threat. this organisation would be equipped with the world's finest pilots, soldiers, scientists and engineers, working together as one multi national force.</p><p>This organisation was named the Extraterrestrial Combat unit: XCOM</p><h4>THE GAME</h4><p>UFO Enemy Unknown puts you in command of XCom, with the finest Earth technology at your disposal to defend the Earth from alien invasion. Shooting down UFOs is just the beginning. You will then control a squad of heavily armed soldiers, edging cautiously through the local terrain, battling aliens and recovering UFO technology.</p><p>When you command a ground assault, you will use the 3-D isometric 'Battlescape' display. This shows terrain, buildings, XCom craft and UFOs, but will only display what your soldiers can see so beware of danger lurking around corners or down dark corridors! Successful ground assault missions mean that XCom scientists can research alien technology. Engineers can then reproduce their superior weapons and spacecraft. Soon you will be fighting the aliens with their own technology.</p><p>As the game progresses, you will use the on line 'UFOpaedia' to learn the latest details from your research teams about alien technology, life forms and their real objectives. Above all, you must watch the world political situation. Look out for governments who may be forced to make secret pacts with the aliens and make sure you defend the countries who fund XCom heavily.</p><p>UFO Enemy Unknown. Command Earth's forces against the alien terror! THIS MANUAL</p><p>This Manual is split into two main sections;</p><p>Section 1: The Gameplay Tutorials are designed to get you playing UFO Enemy Unknown as quickly as possible. You are recommended to follow each tutorial before you start to play the game on your own.</p><p>Section 2: The Reference Guide is intended for the player who is familiar with how to play UFO Enemy Unknown and needs to learn more about particular game features. The Controls</p><p>You will require a Mouse to play UFO Enemy Unknown. This manual will refer to 'clicking' on buttons, icons or highlighted text. To do this, simply move the cursor over the option and press the Left Mouse Button (LMB).</p><p>SORTING THE MATERIALS</p><p>Your UFO Enemy Unknown package contains this Manual, a Technical Supplement and a set of disks to run the game.</p><h4>SECTION 1 - THE GAMEPLAY TUTORIALS</h4><h4>BEFORE WE BEGIN...</h4><p>Welcome to UFO Enemy Unknown. These tutorials are designed to help you start playing with the minimum of trouble. The three main sections of the game are covered here; the Geoscape, the Battlescape and the Bases Screen.</p><p>For extra information on particular game features, see the Reference Guide section of the manual.</p><p>First of all, we will start a new game.</p><h4>Starting a New Game</h4><p>1. Install and Load UFO Enemy Unknown by referring to your Technical supplement.</p><p>2. After the animated introduction, you will be taken to the Copy Protection Screen.</p><p>Type in the from the manual reference given. You will be taken to the game options screen.</p><p>3. Move the mouse pointer over the New Game option and click on the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to select. You will now be taken to the Select Difficulty Level screen.</p><p>4. Move the mouse pointer over the Beginner option and click on the LMB to select. You will now be taken into the main game screen, the Geoscape. The first thing you must do is to position your first XCom base on the surface of the Earth.</p><h4>Setting-Up a New XCom Base</h4><p>5. The message Select Site for New Base will appear in the top of the screen.</p><p>In the bottom right hand side of the screen, you will see three green spheres surrounded by arrows. These are the view controls which allow you to rotate and magnify the display of the Earth.</p><p>Click on the up arrow icon. The Earth display will be magnified, some borders around countries will appear.</p><p>6. Click again on the up arrow icon. The Earth display will be magnified again, some country names will now appear.</p><p>7. Click twice on the down arrow icon. The Earth display will return to its minimum magnification.</p><p>8. The four arrow icon allows you to rotate the Earth display up, down, left, or right.</p><p>Click a few times on the up arrow, The Earth display will tilt towards you</p><p>9. Click a few times on the left arrow, the Earth display will rotate.</p><p>10. Position the Mouse pointer over the Earth and click on the Right Mouse Button to centre the Geoscape on that location.</p><p>By using a combination of these controls, you can manipulate the Earth display to show any part of the Earth in detail.</p><p>Note. It is a good idea to position your base in the middle of a large land mass such as North or South America, Russia or Europe. This will give , you a better chance of defending that area from UFO raids.</p><p>12. A window containing the prompt Base Name? will appear Type in a name using the Keyboard and press the Return Key. You have now set up a new XCom base and you are ready to start playing UFO Enemy Unknown.</p><h4>TUTORIAL 1: THE GEOSCAPE</h4><p>Tutorial 1 guides you through the Geoscapes basic controls and the process of intercepting UFOs.</p><p>1. The Geoscape is the main screen for playing UFO Enemy Unknown. You will see your base on the 3-D view of the Earth, represented as a hollow blue square.</p><p>On the right-hand side of the screen, there is a list of Menu Options a display of the Game Time, the Time Controls and the View Controls.</p><p>The Time Controls are very important to the game, and it is these which we will go through next.</p><p>Note: If you wish to pause the time at any stage during the game, simply click on any of the menu options.</p><p>The Time Controls 2. Look at the Game Time. You will see that it is passing by with five second jumps. The Time Controls below the Game Time, allow you to control the rate at which this time passes.</p><p>Click on the 5 Mins button. The button will depress and time will pass at an increased rate. You will see the Game Time (above the Time Controls) change rapidly and night and day will be visible on the Earth, slowly changing.</p><p>You should use the Time Controls to advance the game through any time consuming section of the game (e.g. waiting for craft to arrive at their destinations or waiting for UFOs to be detected)</p><h4>Detecting UFOs</h4><p>3. We will now advance time to the point when XCom detect their first UFO (if this has not already happened.</p><p>Click on the 1 Day button in the Time Controls. The button will depress and time will pass at the maximum rate.</p><p>4. Eventually, a window will appear over the Geoscape with the message UFO-1 Detected. data regarding the UFO is shown in this window.</p><p>Click on the button marked Centre on UFO-Time=5 Secs. This will centre the Earth display on the UFO and reduce the passage of time to 5 seconds. The UFO will appear as a red cross in the centre of the Geoscape, moving slowly.</p><h4>Intercepting UFOs</h4><p>5. Position the Mouse pointer on your base and click on the LMB. a window will appear with the title Launch Interception and a list of the available craft at the base. 6. Move the Mouse pointer to highlight Interceptor 2 and click on the LMB.</p><p>7. The message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen.</p><p>Click on the UFO (represented as a red cross) to select this as the Interceptors target.</p><p>8. The confirmation message Target: UFO-1 will appear.</p><p>Click on the OK button.</p><p>9. The Interceptor (represented by a yellow cross) will launch from its underground base and attempt to intercept the UFO.</p><p>Note: remember, if you need to pause the game, click on any of the Geoscape Menu Options.</p><p>If the UFO lands, it will appear as a green cross. Interceptors cannot carry out ground attacks; so you will have to wait until the UFO lifts off - click on 5 Mins Time Control Button to accelerate the passage of time.</p><p>10. At this point, one of two things could happen:-</p><p>A. If your Interceptor catches the UFO, the Air-to-Air Combat window will appear. Skip the rest of this section and go to step 19 of this tutorial.</p><p>B. If your Interceptor loses contact with the UFO, the window UFO-1 Tracking Lost will appear. This may happen several times before you actually get into combat; most UFOs can outperform your Interceptors.</p><p>Click on the OK button. Continue to the next step of this tutorial. 11. The Craft Status window will now appear, allowing you to redirect the Interceptor.</p><p>12. Click on the Go To Last Known UFO Position button. 13. While the Interceptor is on its way to the last known UFO position, it uses its on-board radar to scan for the UFO.</p><p>If the UFO-1 Detected window reappears, go straight to step 14 of this tutorial.</p><p>If the Interceptor reaches the last known UFO position without re-acquiring the UFO, the following window will appear:-</p><p>If this happens, the UFO has disappeared from all XCom tracking devices. The interception mission has failed.</p><p>Click on the Redirect Craft button. The Craft Status window will re-appear. Click on Return to Base. The Interceptor will return to its base.</p><p>Go back to step 3 of this tutorial.</p><p>14. Click on the Centre on UFO-Time=5 Secs button in the UFO-1 Detected window.</p><p>15. At the moment, the Interceptor is still heading for the last reported position of the UFO. Now we'll re-assign the UFO as the Interceptor's target.</p><p>Click on the Interceptor. This will bring up the Craft Status window. 16. Click on the Select New Target button.</p><p>17. The message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen. Click on the UFO to re-select it as the target.</p><p>18. The message Target: UFO-1 will re-appear.</p><p>Click on the OK button.</p><p>Go back to step 10 of this tutorial.</p><h4>Air-to-Air Combat</h4><p>19. If the Interceptor gets within range of the UFO, the Geoscape will automatically increase in magnification and the Air-to-Air Combat window will appear over the centre of the Geoscape.</p><p>20. UFOs should not be shot down over water because you will not be able to examine the wreckage.</p><p>Click on the minimise window (large &amp; small rectangles) icon in the top left of the Air-to-Air Combat window. The craft icon will appear in the top left of the screen.</p><p>Check that the UFO is over dry land. If it is over the sea, you can use the 1 Min Time Control to accelerate the passage of time.</p><p>21. Click on the craft icon when the UFO is over the land. This will bring back the Air-to Air Combat window, ready for you to attack the UFO.</p><p>22. Click on the (.&lt;) icon to carry out a Standard Attack on the UFO. You will see the progress of the attack on the radar screen in the left hand side of the Air-to-Air Combat window. The message box in the bottom of the window relays the pilot's messages to you</p><p>If the UFO out runs the Interceptor, return to step 10 of this tutorial.</p><p>If the Interceptor destroys the UFO, you have failed in your objectives; there is no useful debris to investigate. Return to step 3 of this tutorial. If the UFO crash lands, you have succeeded in your objectives; the crash site is marked with a white cross. The UFO is now vulnerable to a ground assault, allowing you to recover the wreckage.</p><h4>Saving the Game</h4><p>23. Now would be a good time to save your current game.</p><p>Click on the Options button.</p><p>24. Click on the Save Game button.</p><p>25. The Select Save Position screen will appear.</p><p>Click on any of the ten numbered buttons to select the slot into which your current game will be saved.</p><p>26. Type in a name for your saved game using the Keyboard and press the Return Key. When the game has saved, you will be returned to the Geoscape.</p><h4>Investigating the Crash Site.</h4><p>27. You will need to assign a Skyranger transport to take a squad of soldiers from your base to the Crash Site.</p><p>Find your base (you may need to rotate the Geoscape to bring it into view). Click on your base: the Launch Interception window will appear. 28. Move the Mouse pointer to highlight Skyranger-1 and click.</p><p>29. The message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen. .</p><p>30. Click on the UFO Crash Site (the white cross) to the Skyrangers target.</p><p>31. The message Target: Crash Site-1 will appear.</p><p>Click on the OK button. 32. The Skyranger (represented by a yellow cross) will launch and make its way to the UFO Crash Site.)</p><p>Click on the 5 mins button if you want to increase the passage of time.</p><p>33. When the Skyranger arrives at the Crash Site, the UFO Crash Recovery screen will appear. Read the instructions on this screen.</p><p>Click on the OK button to enter the next section of UFO Enemy Unknown; the Battlescape.</p><h4>TUTORIAL 2: THE BATTLESCAPE</h4><p>Tutorial 2 guides you through the close combat Battlescape; the section of the game where you fight the aliens face to face.</p><h4>Arming Your Squad</h4><p>1. The eight members of your squad automatically arm themselves with guns, ammunition and grenades. The initial screen allows you to adjust the weapons your squad will carry into action.</p><p>Click on the left/right arrows in the top right of the screen to check the armament of each of the eight members of your squad.</p><p>2. You will see that six of your soldiers have rifles, one has a pistol and one has a heavy cannon. The soldiers carry extra ammunition and grenades on their belts.</p><p>Full details of this section of the game are given in the Ground Assaults chapter of this manual.</p><p>Click on the OK button to exit this screen.</p><p>3. The 'turn' screen will appear.</p><p>Note: All Battlescape action is turn based. This means it is like a 3-D game of chess - you move your pieces, the aliens moves theirs!</p><p>Click the Left Mouse Button to continue.</p><h4>The Battlescape</h4><p>4. You will now see your Skyranger on the ground with its rear door open. The aircraft's cabin roof is 'peeled away' to reveal your squad of eight soldiers within.</p><p>The bottom section of the screen contains a number of buttons and displays. This section of the screen is known as the Control Bar.</p><h4>Using the Split Level View</h4><p>5. The Battlescape is built up of several levels. These can be viewed individually or may be assembled into a complete 3-D picture. Splitting the Battlescape into levels allows you to see behind walls and inside buildings or craft.</p><p>At the moment, the Battlescape is set to normal setting - the Multi-level View. The multi-level view hides everything above the currently selected level, this is why the Skyranger appears to have no roof.</p><p>Click on the diamond 1 button in the Control Bar. The number on the button will change to 2.</p><p>The cabin roof and wings of the Skyranger will appear. Your soldiers will now be hidden from view. This is a Full View of the Battlescape.</p><p>6. Click again on the diamond 1 button. The number on the button will change back to 1. The Battlescape returns to the Multi-level View.</p><p>7. When you are in any of these views, you may need to switch to the next level up or down.</p><p>Click on the Down arrow/ladder button.</p><p>8. The display will change to show just the landing legs and tail ramp of the Skyranger.</p><p>9. Click on the up arrow/ladder button. The display will return to the original view, with your squad visible inside the Skyranger</p><h4>Selecting Soldiers</h4><p>10. You control your squad individually, selecting and moving each soldier in turn</p><p>Move the Mouse pointer over the Battlescape display. A red 3-D box will appear under the pointer.</p><p>11. Move this box over any soldier. The box will now flash yellow and red.</p><p>12. Click on the Left Mouse Button. A yellow arrow appears above the soldier's head to show that he/she is now selected.</p><p>13. Move the Mouse pointer over any other soldier in the Skyranger and click to select. Watch the soldier's name (halfway down the Control Bar) change.</p><h4>Moving Soldiers</h4><p>14. Move the Mouse pointer over either of the soldiers at the rear of the Skyranger and click to select. The yellow arrow appears above the soldier's head to show that he/she is now selected.</p><p>15. Now, move the Mouse pointer over the ground just behind and to the right of the Skyranger.</p><p>16. Click the Left Mouse Button.</p><p>The soldier will walk out of the Skyranger to the destination you have just set. The Battlescape automatically switches to the next level down, so that the Skyranger now only appears as the ramp and a set of landing legs. 17. Click on the up arrow/ladder button. 18. Move the Mouse pointer over the other soldier at the rear of the Skyranger and click to select.</p><p>19. Now move the Mouse pointer over the ground just behind and to the left of the Skyranger.</p><p>20. Click the Left Mouse Button.</p><p>The soldier will walk out of the Skyranger to the destination you have set.</p><p>21. We now have two soldiers deployed from the Skyranger. You may notice that the Battlescape displays a little more of the surrounding terrain now. This is because the Battlescape only shows what is in your squad's line of sight.</p><p>Move the 3-D box to a point near one of the landing legs and click on the Right Mouse Button.</p><p>The currently selected soldier will turn round and face the Skyranger, scanning the surrounding terrain in the process. Any nearby black squares will turn into terrain as the soldier looks at them.</p><p>22. If you want to look around the Battlescape at the visible terrain, move the Mouse pointer to the very edge of the screen. The view window will move in that direction.</p><p>Note: you must take the Mouse pointer to the very bottom of the screen, under the Control Bar, to move the view window downwards.</p><p>23. Click on the man/four arrows button to re-centre the Battlescape on the currently selected soldier.</p><p>24. Click on the two people button. The next soldier in your squad will be selected.</p><p>This is an alternative way of selecting soldiers, saving you from having to search around the Battlescape for every soldier.</p><p>25. Move this soldier out of the Skyranger, in the same way as the other two.</p><p>26. Select and move another soldier out of the skyranger.</p><p>27. You now have four soldiers deployed from the Skyranger. This is enough for the moment, the rest can remain on board as reinforcements.</p><p>The primary objective of this mission is to kill or stun the aliens. A good place to find aliens is the crashed UFO itself, so we'll start the search there.</p><h4>The Map Screen</h4><p>28. Click on the rectangle grid button to access the Map Screen. This displays a map of the mission area, allowing you to see XCom and alien forces, XCom craft and UFOs.</p><p>29. You will see four flashing yellow dots on the map; these are your soldiers. If a UFO has been spotted, its hull appears as a pale grey line.</p><p>30. The map only shows one level of the Battlescape at a time.</p><p>Click on the up/down arrows on the left-hand side of the screen to display the next level up or down.</p><p>31. Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape.</p><h4>The Turn - Based System</h4><p>32. If you saw a UFO in the Map screen, start moving your soldiers towards it. If not, continue moving your soldiers around the Battlescape until you find the UFO.</p><p>Eventually the message Not Enough Time Units! appears.</p><p>33. This means that the selected soldier has moved as far as he/she can possibly move in this turn. When all four of the soldiers have moved to this point, it is time to end your turn. Click on the circle/ button to end the turn.</p><p>The aliens will now be given a turn to move. They may open fire on your squad - you are helpless until your next turn.</p><p>On screen prompts tell you when to click the LMB to begin your next turn.</p><p>Searching For the Aliens</p><p>34. Continue moving your squad around the Battlescape</p><p>to go through doors, click inside the room</p><p>to go up stairs, click at the top of the stairs</p><p>You will notice that the Battlescape has an edge beyond which everything is black. This is the edge of the map - aliens will not go into this area.</p><h4>Seeing the Aliens</h4><p>35. If one of your soldiers sees an alien, he/she will immediately stop moving and a red flashing square will appear in the right of the Battlescape screen, just above the Control Bar.</p><p>Click on the red flashing square to centre the Battlescape on the alien</p><p>36. The alien can now be seen in the centre of the screen</p><p>Click on the grid rectangle button to access the Map Screen.</p><p>37. Aliens will appear as blue flashing dots on this map, the white cross indicates where the map is centred.</p><p>Look for your soldiers on the map - there might be soldiers in a better position to fire than the soldier currently selected.</p><p>Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape</p><p>38. If you want to re-centre the Battlescape on the currently selected soldier, click on the direction arrows button in the Control bar.</p><h4>Using Guns</h4><p>39. We will now use a weapon against the alien, before it gets the chance to fire at us. This is probably a long range shot, so a rifle will be required.</p><p>Click on the rifle (at the far right of the Control Bar).</p><p>40. A window will appear, allowing you to choose from a number of shots.</p><p>Move the Mouse pointer over the Aimed Shot option and click.</p><p>41. You will now return to the Battlescape. The cursor has changed to a targeting cross instead of the 3-D box.</p><p>Position the cross over the alien and click the Left Mouse Button.</p><p>42. Now, one of four things could happen:</p><p>A. The message No Line of Fire! appears. This means that there is an object between your soldier and the alien. You must move your soldier to a different position or select another soldier before attempting to fire again.</p><p>B. The message Not Enough Time Units! appears. This means that your soldier does not have enough Time Units to complete the shot. You must either choose another type of shot, select another soldier or end your turn.</p><p>C. The soldier fires a shot.. and misses. This is unfortunate, but is expected - initially your soldiers are all rookies. You will find that your soldiers become more accurate as they fight more battles.</p><p>D. The soldier hits the alien with the shot. The aliens wear strong armour, so it may take more than one hit to kill them.</p><p>Click on the Right Mouse Button to change the Mouse pointer from a targeting Cross to the 3-D box, ready to move your soldier again</p><h4>Using Grenades</h4><p>43. If an alien is using an object for cover, you may prefer to attack it with a Grenade.</p><p>Click on the single man button to access the Equip Soldier screen. This is similar to the screen which you saw before entering the Battlescape</p><p>44. Initially every soldier has one grenade (the round black object) in his/her belt.</p><p>Move the Mouse pointer over the grenade and click.</p><p>The word Grenade will appear below the Soldier's name</p><p>45. Move the Grenade over the box marked Left Hand and click again</p><p>If the soldier has enough Time Units, the Grenade will be placed in the soldier's left hand.</p><p>If the soldier does not have enough Time Units, replace the grenade in the belt and repeat the operation after the next turn.</p><p>46. Click on the OK button to return to the Battlescape.</p><p>47. You will now see the Grenade in the Item Box on the far left of the Control Bar.</p><p>Click on the Grenade.</p><p>48. A window containing the options Prime Grenade or Throw will appear.</p><p>Click on Prime Grenade.</p><p>Note: If at any stage your soldier runs out of Time Units, simply end the turn and complete the priming/throwing process on the next turn. But beware! The Soldier may be killed during the aliens turn if he/she is not in cover.</p><p>49. The Set timer window will appear, allowing you to set the number of turns until the grenade detonates.</p><p>Click on the number 3.</p><p>You will now return to the Battlescape, with a primed grenade in your soldier's left hand</p><p>50. You now have three turns to throw the grenade and get away from the blast area.</p><p>Click on the grenade again.</p><p>51. The only option is Throw.</p><p>Click on throw.</p><p>52. You now return to the Battlescape. The cursor has a throw icon superimposed over the 3-D box</p><p>Click on the location where you want to throw the grenade.</p><p>53. One of three things will happen:-</p><p>A. The soldier will throw the grenade.</p><p>B. The message Out of Range! will appear. This is because the target location is too far away. If this happens, choose a target location which is closer to your soldier.</p><p>C. The message Unable to throw here! will appear. This is because an object is obstructing the throw. If this happens choose a different target location.</p><p>Don't forget. Once you have thrown the grenade, you've got just three turns to clear the area!</p><h4>Completing the Mission</h4><p>54. Continue searching for aliens (go back to step 34 of this tutorial). When all aliens have been killed, the mission is over.</p><p>XCom will then automatically recover the UFO's remains, alien artefacts and alien corpses.</p><p>To abort the mission before the mission objectives are completed, click on the plane button in the Control bar.</p><p>Abort mission will only save soldiers who have returned to the Skyranger - a warning message will appear if you attempt to take off without your full squad.</p><p>Note: Do not allow the aliens to kill all of your squad - there will be no one to fly the Skyranger back to base, and it will be lost. If you are down to your last soldier, abort the mission.</p><h4>The Debriefing</h4><p>55. At the end of the ground assault mission, you will be given a debriefing. This will inform you if your mission objectives were achieved and lists the items recovered.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom left of this screen to return to the Geoscape.</p><p>56. You might want to save the game at this point (see step 23 of Tutorial 1 for details of how to save games). If you want to replay the ground assault load in your previously saved game. TUTORIAL 3: BASES -----------------</p><p>From research and manufacture to equipping craft and soldiers, the Bases screens define how well you will be able to deal with the alien threat. Tutorial 3 guides you through this, the most complex section of UFO Enemy Unknown.</p><p>1. If you are continuing from tutorial 2, do not worry if you 1ost your Skyranger; you can buy another in the Bases Screen.</p><p>Click on the button labelled Bases in the Geoscape Menu Options.</p><p>2. The Bases Screen will appear.</p><p>Note: From now until you re-enter the Geoscape Screen, time is paused. If at any time you need to pause the game, simply click on one of the Geoscape Menu Options.</p><h4>Equipping the Interceptor.</h4><p>3. We will now use the Equip Craft screen to re-arm one of the Interceptors.</p><p>Click on the button labelled Equip Craft in the Bases screen.</p><p>You will enter the Interception Craft screen, allowing you to choose which craft you will equip with weapons or equipment.</p><p>4. Move the Mouse pointer over Interceptor 2 (a pale highlight will appear to show it is selected) and click.</p><p>5.

The armaments loaded onto the aircraft are Stingray missiles and a Cannon.</p><p>Click on the button marked with the number 2.</p><p>6. The Select Armament window will appear.</p><p>You will see that you have 1 Stingray short-range missile launcher, Avalanche long range missile launcher and 2 cannons in the base's stores.</p><p>7. We will now re-arm the Interceptor with Avalanche long-range missiles in place of the cannon. Move the Mouse pointer over Avalanche (a pale highlight will appear to show it is selected) and click. 8. The display will return to the Interceptor-2 Equip Craft screen. The Interceptor now has an all missile armament - this is more effective for attacking UFOs.</p><p>Click on the button marked OK in the bottom of the screen.</p><p>9. You will now return to the Interception Craft screen. You will see that the Status column for Interceptor 2 shows that it is Rearming.</p><p>Click on the button marked OK in the bottom of this screen.</p><p>10. You will return to the Bases screen.</p><p>Next we will assign XCom scientists to undertake research.</p><p>Click on the button marked Research.</p><h4>Assigning Research</h4><p>11. You will be taken to the Current Research screen</p><p>We will now assign our scientists to work on two different research projects; Laser Weapons and the Motion Scanner.</p><p>Click on the button labelled New Project in the bottom left of the screen.</p><p>12. The New Research Projects window will appear.</p><p>Move the Mouse pointer over Laser Weapons (a pale highlight will appear to show it is selected) and click.</p><p>13.

Click on the button marked OK.</p><p>20. You will return to the New Research Projects window.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom of this window.</p><p>21. You will now return to the Current Research screen. You will see that you have 10 scientists assigned to researching Laser Weapons and 10 scientists assigned to researching the Motion Scanner. The progress in each of these projects is unknown; the scientists have not yet started work.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom-right of this screen.</p><p>22. You will return to the Bases screen.</p><p>Another important function carried out in the Bases screen is the purchasing of items or the recruiting of personnel.</p><p>Click on the button marked Purchase/Recruit.</p><h4>Purchasing/Recruiting</h4><p>23. You will be taken to the Purchase/Hire Personnel screen.</p><p>We will now purchase some items and hire some extra soldiers.</p><p>Move the Mouse pointer over the up arrow button in the Soldier line (at the top of the list of items) and click once.</p><p>24. You will see the number in the Quantity column change to 1.</p><p>Click on the up arrow button until the message Not Enough Living Space! appears.</p><p>Note: The message Not Enough Living Space! appears because you do not have enough Living Quarter facilities at your base to accommodate the soldiers. To build more Living Quarters, click on the Build Facilities button in the Bases screen, see the Bases section of the Reference Guide of this manual for full details.</p><p>25. If you lost your Skyranger troop transport in the ground assault, you can replace it by clicking once on the up arrow button in the Skyranger line of this screen.</p><p>26. Move the Mouse pointer down the list until you get to Tank/Rocket Launcher. The tank is a large weapon, expensive but powerful.</p><p>27. Click once on the up arrow button. You will see the Cost Of Purchases (in the top-right of this screen) increase by $900,000 (the cost of the tank).</p><p>28. Now we'll need some ammunition for it. Move the Mouse pointer over the HWP Rocket up arrow button and click four times. You may need to buy more ammunition later when you return from your next ground assault.</p><p>Note: The message Not Enough Store Space! will appear if you attempt to buy too many items. To build more storage space, click on the Build Facilities button in the Bases screen - again, see the Bases section of the Reference Guide of this manual for full details.</p><p>29. Click on the down arrow button in the bottom-right of the screen. The list will move down a little. Continue clicking on this button until it disappears. You have reached the bottom of the list. The last item on the list is the Stun Rod. This item allows your soldiers to knock aliens out instead of killing them, the alien can then be recovered alive and interrogated.</p><p>30. Move the mouse pointer over the Stun Rod up arrow button and click twice.</p><p>31. If you lost your Skyranger in the ground assault, you will need to equip its crew. Carry out the same process as above to choose some weapons from the list - don't forget ammunition if you buy guns or rocket launchers.</p><p>32. You have now completed choosing what you want to buy.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom-left of the screen to confirm the purchase.</p><p>33. You will return to the Bases screen.</p><p>Click on the Geoscape button in the bottom-right of the Bases screen, you will return to the Geoscape.</p><h4>Waiting For Delivery</h4><p>34. It will take several days for all the items you purchased to be delivered.</p><h4>Check the Game Time.</h4><p>Click on the 1 Day button in the Geoscape Time Controls and allow 3 days to pass. If a UFO is detected, intercept it (see step 4 of tutorial 1 for full details).</p><p>35. Several windows may appear as time passes. For the moment, just click on the OK button to make them go away. We'll worry about these later.</p><p>When 3 days have passed, click on the 5 Secs button.</p><p>36. We will now return to the Bases screen and equip the Skyranger with all the items we have just purchased.</p><p>Click on the Bases button.</p><p>37. Click on the Equip Craft button.</p><h4>Equipping the Skyranger</h4><p>38. Use the Mouse to highlight and click on Skyranger-1.</p><p>39. The Equip Craft screen for the Skyranger will appear.</p><p>You will see the soldiers assigned to the Skyranger, next to the button marked Crew. If you didn't lose any in the ground assault, there will be eight soldier icons.</p><p>Click on the Crew button.</p><p>40. The Select Squad screen will appear.</p><p>This screen displays the names of the soldiers who are assigned to Skyranger-1.</p><p>Click on any names which are shown in light blue. This will assign them to Skyranger 1. The Craft column of this screen shows which craft the soldiers are assigned to.</p><p>41. When all the soldier's names are shown in white, all the soldiers at the base are assigned to Skyranger-1.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom of this screen.</p><p>42. You will return to the Equip Craft screen. Now we'll load some equipment onto the Skyranger.</p><p>Click on the button marked Equipment.</p><p>43.

The number in the Stores column changes to 1 from 0, and the name of the item changes from light blue to white, indicating that it is on board.</p><p>44. Use the same process to load any other equipment of your choice onto the Skyranger.</p><p>45. Click on the OK button in the bottom of the screen.</p><p>46. You will return to the Equip Craft screen.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom of the Equip Craft screen to return to the Interception Craft screen.</p><p>47. Click on the OK button in the bottom of the Interception Craft screen to return to the Bases screen.</p><p>48. Click on the Geoscape button in the bottom-right of the Bases screen. You will return to the Geoscape.</p><h4>Returning to the Geoscape</h4><p>49. Click on the 1 Day button in the Geoscape Time Controls. Soon, a message will appear on the Geoscape. This may be one of the following: UFO Detected - go to step 4 of tutorial 1 for details of intercepting UFOs when you investigate the crash site this time, your soldiers will be better equipped.</p><p>Research Completed - your scientists have completed their research work. You should allocate them to another project as soon as possible (see step 11 of this tutorial). XCom Project Monthly Report - at the end of each month, the XCom Project Monthly Report will appear to inform you of your progress in the fight against the aliens. See the Geoscape section of the Reference Guide of this manual for full details.</p><p>Other messages may appeal to inform you that a new purchase has arrived or a manufacturing process has become available.</p><h4>The End Of the Tutorial</h4><p>Much of the enjoyment of UFO Enemy Unknown is discovering new technology, gathering information on the aliens and battling through hundreds of different landscapes.</p><p>These tutorials have been a basic guide to the way UFO Enemy Unknown plays. There may be further game enhancements which are documented in the Technical Supplement. Use the Reference Guide section of this manual for details of specific menu options or game features.</p><h4>Playing Tips</h4><p>To succeed in the war against the aliens, you will need to carry out the following:-</p><h4>Establish more bases around the world</h4><p>Click on the Build New Base button in the Bases screen. Establish bases in the countries who are funding you heavily - refer to the Graphs screen for this information.</p><h4>Build more facilities at your bases.</h4><p>Click on the Build Facilities button in the Bases screen. Experiment with different sized bases - you don't always have to build hangars. Build dedicated 'listening posts', equipped with both large and small radar systems, then add hangars when you can afford them. By using this tactic, you will detect many more UFOs.</p><h4>Develop a powerful squad</h4><p>Don't allow your soldiers to be killed in the ground assaults, you will find that they fight better when they are more experienced. Equip your squad with the best weapons available and avoid exposing your soldiers to enemy fire by keeping them in cover.</p><h4>Plan your research carefully</h4><p>Concentrate research on developing alien based technologies and take care that your scientists stay busy - research work costs relatively little and the rewards are great.</p><p>Build new weapons and craft based on alien technology</p><p>If your scientists have researched alien items, your engineers will be able to reproduce them. XCom will eventually be using the most advanced weaponry on Earth, fighting the aliens with their own technology.</p><h4>SECTION 2: THE REFERENCE GUIDE</h4><h4>1. GAME OPTIONS</h4><p>The Game Options screen appears when you load UFO Enemy Unknown, allowing you to select between New Game or Load Saved Game. Position the Mouse Pointer over the required option and click the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to select.</p><h4>1.1 NEW GAME</h4><p>If you select New Game in the Game Option screen, you will be taken to the Select Difficulty Level screen.</p><p>This allows you to change the way the game plays to suit your skill level, from level 1 (Beginner) to level 5 (Superhuman). It is recommended that you complete the game at one of the lower difficulty levels before attempting to play the game at level 5.</p><p>The difficulty level affects :-</p><p>- the hostility and skill of aliens</p><p>- the aggression of UFOs</p><p>Pick a difficulty level by clicking on one of these five buttons.</p><p>You will now be taken to the main game screen, the geoscape The message Select Site For New Base will appear at the top of the screen</p><p>Click on any part of the world to position your first XCom base. Use the Geoscape controls if you want to rotate the display of the Earth (see the section of this manual on The Geoscape Screen for full details of the Geoscape controls)</p><p>The last New Game set-up is to name your first base. The prompt Base Name? will appear - type in your first bases name using the Keyboard and press the Return Key. You will now be able to use the Geoscape as normal.</p><h4>1.2 LOAD SAVED GAME</h4><p>If you select Load Saved Game in the Game Options, you will be taken to the Select Game To Load Screen.</p><p>The name of the saved game is displayed in the middle of the screen, the game's time and date is also displayed.</p><p>Pick a saved game by clicking on one of the ten buttons on the left-hand side of the screen and click the LMB. You will now be taken to the Geoscape, at the point when the game was saved.</p><h4>2. THE GEOSCAPE SCREEN.</h4><p>The Geoscape Screen is the main screen for playing UFO Enemy Unknown; it displays the latest data on alien activity and allows you to control and monitor XCom interception craft.</p><p>The Geoscape screen is made up of five parts: the Geoscape, the View Controls, the Time Controls, the Game Time and the Menu Options.</p><h4>2.1 THE GEOSCAPE</h4><p>The Geoscape is a 3-D view of the Earth which may be rotated or magnified. At minimum magnification it displays the whole planet, while at maximum magnification it shows detail such as borders and cities. Terrain types from desert to snowscape are represented on the surface of each of the continents, and night and day are fully simulated.</p><p>The Geoscape uses symbols to represent the following:-</p><p>Blue Box - an XCom base Yellow + - an XCOm craft Orange x - an XCom craft's destination (also known as a 'waypoint') Red + - a UFO in the air. Green x - a UFO on the ground White x - a UFO crash site Pink Box - an alien base Pink + - an alien terror site</p><h4>2.2 THE VIEW CONTROLS</h4><p>The view Controls allow you to manipulate the view of the Earth in the Geoscape.</p><p>Click on the up or down arrows to tilt the view of the Earth up or down.</p><p>Click on the left or right arrows to rotate the view of the Earth to the left or right (about the Earth's polar axis)</p><p>Click on the up arrow icon to increase the magnification of the Geoscape.</p><p>Click on the down arrow icon to decrease the magnification of the Geoscape.</p><p>Click on the Geoscape using the Right Mouse Button to centre the display on that location.</p><h4>2.3 THE TIME CONTROLS</h4><p>The Time Controls allow you to adjust the rate at which time passes in the game.</p><p>Time may be accelerated from 5 second stages to 1 minute, 5 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour and 1 day segments. This means that you may cut out the long periods of waiting for XCom radar to detect a UFO. To select a particular rate of time passage, click on any of the six Time Control Buttons.</p><p>The passage of time is suspended when any of the Geoscape Menu Options are accessed.</p><h4>2.4 THE GAME TIME</h4><p>UFO Enemy Unknown begins at 12:00 pm on the 1st January 1999. All game times are given in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).</p><h4>2.4.1 THE XCOM PROJECT MONTHLY REPORT</h4><p>At the end of each month, you will be given a report of your progress so far. This report is in the following form:-</p><p>Month - the month which has just ended.</p><p>Monthly Rating - XCom's overall performance rating for the previous month. This takes into account the following:-</p><p>- success of interceptions</p><p>- scores for ground assault missions</p><p>- research work completed</p><p>- alien activity</p><p>A plus ( + ) sign before the figure indicates a good performance, a minus (-) sign indicates a poor performance.</p><p>Funding Change - the difference between this months and last month's total funding. A plus ( + ) sign before the figure indicates an increase in funding, a minus (-) sign indicates a decrease in funding.</p><p>This is followed by a general report on how the Council of Funding Nations views recent XCom anti alien operations.</p><p>Click on the OK button to exit this screen.</p><h4>2.4.2 PSIONIC TRAINING</h4><p>If you have built a Psi-Lab at any of your bases, you will be taken to the Psionic Training screen each month, after the Monthly Report.</p><p>Psionic powers allow XCom soldiers to use mind control as a weapon. The Psi Amp is required to convert the thoughts into psionic powers, without this the soldier cannot use psionic skills as a weapon.</p><p>The Psionic Training screen lists all XCom bases with a Psi Lab facility. Psi Labs are essential to carry out psionic training.</p><p>Click on any of the Base Name buttons to Assign soldiers to Psionic Training at that base.</p><h4>2.4.2.1 Assign Soldiers to Psionic Training</h4><p>This screen allows you to assign individual soldiers to psionic training. The top of the screen shows the Remaining Psi-Lab Capacity. This indicates the number of soldiers who may be assigned to Psionic Training.</p><p>Below this is a list of the following:-</p><p>Name - the soldier's name.</p><p>Psionic Strength - this is a measure of the soldier's natural ability to defend against psionic attack. It never changes, regardless of how much training the soldier goes through.</p><p>Psionic Skill/Improvement - this is the soldier's ability to use the Psi Amp in mental combat. The soldier's mental combat ability is dependent on both this and Psionic Strength.</p><p>Note: it is better to concentrate your Psionic Training on soldier's with high Psionic Strength.</p><p>In Training? - whether or not the soldier is in training.</p><p>Note: carrying out missions also improves a soldier's Psionic Skill.</p><p>Click on the OK button to return to the Psionic Training screen.</p><p>Click on another Base Name button to assign more soldier's to Psionic Training or click on the OK button to return to the Geoscape.</p><h4>2.5 THE MENU OPTIONS</h4><p>Click on the Menu Option buttons to access other screens and functions:</p><p>Intercept - allows you to give XCom craft orders to intercept UFOs.</p><p>Bases - takes you into the Bases screen (see the Bases section of this manual for full details).</p><p>Graphs - takes you into the Graphs screen (see the Graphs section of this manual for full details).</p><p>UFOpaedia - takes you into the UFOpaedia (see the UFOpaedia section of this manual for full details).</p><p>Options - takes you into the Options screen (see the Options section of this manual for full details).</p><p>Funding - takes you into the International Relations display (see the Funding section of this manual for full details).</p><h4>2.6 USING THE GEOSCAPE</h4><p>XCom's main task is to shoot down and investigate UFOs. This ensures continued government funding and allows XCom to learn more about the alien threat.</p><p>When there is no UFO activity, you will probably want to keep the rate of time passage fairly high. Click on the 1 hour button in the Geoscape Time Controls. Time will pass rapidly until you get a message informing you that a UFO has been detected.</p><h4>2.6.1 THE UFO DETECTED WINDOW</h4><p>XCom bases automatically detect any UFOs within range of their radar. Later on in the game, you will be able to research and manufacture better detection and tracking systems, based on captured alien technology.</p><p>When a UFO is detected, time is paused and a window titled UFO- (number) Detected appears in the centre of the Geoscape display. Every UFO detected is given a consecutive number, for example, the 41st UFO detected by XCom will be named UFO-41.</p><p>The following data is also presented when a UFO is detected:-</p><p>Size - the size of the UFO.</p><p>Altitude - the approximate height at which the UFO is flying.</p><p>Heading - the general direction in which the UFO is travelling.</p><p>Speed - the speed at which the UFO is travelling (in knots).</p><p>This window also gives you the option to either:-</p><p>Centre on UFO - Time = 5 Secs - centres the Geoscape display on the UFOs current position and reduces the passage of time to 5 seconds. Click on this option if you intend to intercept the UFO. Cancel - hides the message window and leaves the Geoscape as it was before the UFO was detected. Click on this option if you wish to take no action against the UFO.</p><p>Note: While your Interceptors are capable of a high maximum speed, UFOs often travel faster. A UFO may unwittingly change course or slow down, however, so it is good practice to attempt to intercept all UFOs detected.</p><h4>2.6.2 THE LAUNCH INTERCEPTION WINDOW</h4><p>To assign an XCom Interceptor to attack a UFO, you may either click on the Interceptor's base, or click on the Intercept Menu Option (in the top-right of the Geoscape screen)</p><p>The advantage of clicking on the Intercept Menu Option is that you may give orders to an Interceptor which is based on the opposite side of the Geoscape, hidden from view. Simply clicking on a base only allows you to assign craft from that base.</p><p>The Launch Interception window displays the following information:-</p><p>Craft - the type and registration number of the craft (for example, Skyranger 6 is the sixth craft to be operated by XCom and is a Skyranger transport).</p><p>Status - this may be either: -</p><p>Ready - the craft is available for interception duty.</p><p>Refuelling - the craft is refuelling; this can take several hours.</p><p>Rearming - the craft is having its air-to-air weaponry changed.</p><p>Repairs - the craft is undergoing repair work.</p><p>Out - the craft is already carrying out an interception.</p><p>Base - the craft's home base.</p><p>If you wish to return to the Geoscape without selecting an interception craft, click on the Cancel button.</p><h4>2.6.3 SELECTING AN INTERCEPTION CRAFT</h4><p>Use the Mouse to highlight an Interceptor from the Launch Interception list and click to select this craft.</p><p>The Select Destination window will now appear at the top of the screen. If you wish to return to the Geoscape without selecting a target, click on the Cancel button.</p><p>To select a UFO as the interception target, simply click on its location on the Geoscape.</p><p>The message Target: UFO-(number) will appear.</p><p>Click on the OK button to accept this UFO as the target, or click on the Cancel button to select a different target.</p><p>The interceptor will now launch from its underground base and take the most direct path to the UFO.</p><h4>2.6.4 THE CRAFT STATUS WINDOW</h4><p>At any time when an XCom craft is airborne, click on it to display the Craft Status window. This contains the following information:-</p><p>Craft name - the type and registration number of the craft.</p><p>Status - the orders which the craft is carrying out.</p><p>Base - the craft's home base.</p><p>Speed - the current speed of the craft (in knots).</p><p>Maximum Speed - the craft's maximum speed (in knots).</p><p>Altitude - the craft's approximate height.</p><p>Fuel - the percentage of fuel remaining in the craft. When fuel reaches a critical level, the craft will automatically return to base.</p><p>Weapon-1 - The type of weapon loaded into weapon bay number 1 followed by number of rounds of that weapon remaining.</p><p>Weapon-2 - The type of weapon loaded into weapon bay number 2 followed by number of rounds of that weapon remaining.</p><p>The Craft Status Window also has four buttons, allowing you to:-</p><p>Return to Base - abort the interception and return to base.</p><p>Select New Target - abort the interception and select a new target.</p><p>Patrol - abort the interception and remain at the current position.</p><p>Cancel - return to the Geoscape without issuing any orders.</p><h4>2.6.5 THE UFO STATUS WINDOW</h4><p>At any time when a UFO is displayed on the Geoscape, click on it to bring up the UFO Status window, repeating the information shown in the UFO Detected window.</p><h4>2.6.6 THE TRACKING LOST WINDOW</h4><p>The message UFO- (number) Tracking Lost will appear if XCom tracking devices lose contact with a UFO while it is being intercepted.</p><p>Click on the OK button. The Craft Status window will appear, giving you the option to either Return to Base, Patrol or Go to Last known UFO Position.</p><p>It is usually best to go to the last known UFO position, since the interception craft may be able to re acquire the UFO with its on board radar.</p><h4>2.6.7 THE AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT WINDOW</h4><p>When the XCom craft has manoeuvred within firing range of the UFO, the Air-to-Air Combat window will appear. The interception craft is now at stand-off range, awaiting your orders.</p><p>Remember that you are setting out to cause the UFO to crash land, not to blow it into a million pieces!</p><p>The Air-to-Air Combat window consists of the following:-</p><h4>2.6.7.1 The Order Buttons</h4><p>Click on the buttons in this display to carry out the following:-</p><p>Stand-off - follow the UFO without firing at it.</p><p>Cautious Attack - attack the UFO from the maximum range of each weapon.</p><p>Standard Attack - move to the minimum range of each of the available weapons and fire at the standard rate.</p><p>Aggressive Attack - move to the minimum range of each of the available weapons and fire at the maximum rate.</p><p>Disengage - abort the interception and return to base.</p><p>View UFO - replace the Air-to-Air combat window with a view of the UFO. Click on the LMB to return to the Air-to-Air Combat window.</p><h4>2.6.7.2 The Radar Screen</h4><p>The Interceptor will use its on-board radar to carry out the attack on the UFO. The Radar Screen section of the Air-to-Air Combat Window shows the Interceptor's Radar Screen, allowing you to monitor the final stages of the interception.</p><p>The UF0 will appear as a bright &quot;blip&quot; on the Radar Screen, the size of which depends on the size of the UFO.</p><h4>2.6.7.3 The Weapons Display</h4><p>There are a pair of icons either side of the Radar Screen which represent what is fitted to the weapons bays of the Interceptor. These icons each have a number under them, indicating the number of rounds of the weapon which are remaining.</p><p>The maximum range of each of the weapons is also shown, in the form of a line extending out of the weapon icon and onto the Radar Screen. When a UFO gets within this boundary, the Interceptor will open fire.</p><h4>2.6.7.4 The Range to the UFO</h4><p>The range to the UFO is a simple digital readout of the distance from the UFO to the Interceptor.</p><h4>2.6.7.5 The Damage Display</h4><p>The damage display indicates the Interception Craft's current damage state. The picture of the craft is filled in red as it receives damage.</p><h4>2.6.7.6 The Minimise Window Icon</h4><p>If you shoot the UFO down over water, the wreckage will be swept away before anything of value can be recovered. The Minimise Window feature allows you to track the UFO on the Geoscape until it is over land, then shoot it down.</p><p>To carry this out, click on the double rectangle icon in the top-left of the Air-to- Air Combat window. The Craft Icon (with a pictorial representation of the craft plus its XCom registration number) will now appear in the top-left of the Geoscape and time may be advanced or slowed as normal.</p><p>When the UFO gets over the land, click on the Craft Icon. The Air to Air Combat window will now re-appear, ready for you to carry out your attack.</p><p>Note: you can also use the Minimise Window icon to give other Interception Craft orders to attack the UFO. There can be up to four Interception Craft attacking a UFO simultaneously, maximising the chances of success against the larger UFOs.</p><h4>2.6.7.7 The Message Box</h4><p>The Message Box is in the bottom of the Air-to-Air Combat window and displays messages from the pilot of the interceptor to you. These messages either confirm your orders or inform you of what the UFO is doing.</p><h4>2.6.8 SHOOTING THE UFO DOWN</h4><p>Click on the Standard Attack button. The message UFO Crash Lands! will appear if you successfully cause the UFO to crash land. The display will then automatically return to the full screen Geoscape with a white cross marking the UFO Crash Site.</p><h4>2.6.9 INVESTIGATING UFO CRASH SITES</h4><p>The UFO is now vulnerable to ground assault, and you should send out an XCom squad to investigate it and to recover any available alien technology.</p><p>Click on a base or use the intercept Menu Option to select a Skyranger troop transport craft (just as you did previously with the Interceptor and assign the UFO Crash Site as the target. The Skyranger will now take-off and make its way to the UFO Crash Site.</p><p>Note : Only craft which contain soldiers or HWPs are allowed to intercept Crash Sites or landed UFOs.</p><p>When the Skyranger arrives at the Crash Site, you are taken to the UFO Crash Recovery screen</p><p>Click on the OK button to enter the Equip Squad screen. See the next chapter of this manual for full details on Ground Assaults.</p><h4>2.7 OTHER GEOSCAPE USES</h4><p>As well as controlling the interception and investigation of UFOs, the Geoscape may be used for several other functions Some of them are outlined below; the others are for you to discover!</p><h4>2.7.1 GROUND ASSAULTS ON UFOS</h4><p>As well as investigating crashed UFOs, you may send a troop transport craft to an intact UFO which has landed. This is dangerous for your soldiers, however, and is not advised unless you have a very powerful squad.</p><h4>2.7.2 TERROR SITES</h4><p>The aliens will attempt to terrorise civilian populations as part of their invasion plans. This must be prevented at all costs: a successful alien Terror Site in a funding country could cause its government to withdraw from the XCom project.</p><h4>2.7.3 ALIEN RAIDS ON XCOM BASES</h4><p>As the game progresses, the aliens will carry out missions to find XCom bases. If the aliens discover the location of any of your bases, they will attempt to destroy them with a ground assault.</p><h4>2.7.4 ALIEN BASES</h4><p>The aliens will attempt to build bases on the Earth. These are used for a variety of purposes from operating UFOs to infiltrating governments. Alien bases may be detected by sending an Interception Craft to the suspected location of the base and selecting the Patrol option. You advised to raid alien bases at the earliest opportunity, but make sure you have a very powerful squad before you try!</p><h4>3 GROUND ASSAULTS</h4><p>Ground Assaults take place when XCom carry out any of the following:-</p><p>- Investigate crashed UFO sites</p><p>- Assault UFOs at their landing sites.</p><p>- Intervene at alien terror sites.</p><p>- Defend XCom bases against alien attack.</p><p>- Attack alien bases.</p><p>All missions, except defending XCom bases, require you to use a transport craft to get to your destination. When you begin the game, the only troop transport available is the Skyranger, but as the game progresses you will he able to manufacture new craft.</p><h4>3.1 THE EQUIP SQUAD SCREEN</h4><p>Before you begin a Ground Assault, you will be taken to the Equip Squad screen. Your soldiers will automatically pick up some weapons, but you may wish to re-equip them.</p><p>The top left of the Equip Squad screen contains the name of the currently selected soldier. At the top-right of the screen are two arrows, allowing you to select the next, or the previous soldier in your squad.</p><p>At the centre of the screen is a soldier, who will be dressed in the armour which you may have selected in the Equip Craft screen. This soldier is surrounded by the locations in which weapons may be carried. The items on the ground may be picked up and carried by the soldier.</p><p>To pick up a item from the ground, simply move the Mouse over the item and click. The item will now be &quot;attached&quot; to the Mouse pointer. The name of this item is shown in the top of the screen under the soldier's name. Move the item over the location in which you want it to be carried and click again. The item will now be available for use by the soldier.</p><p>To load a weapon with ammunition, pick up the ammunition and click on the appropriate weapon. To carry this out, the weapon must be in a hand, the right type and unloaded.</p><p>To unload ammunition from a weapon, pick up the loaded weapon and click on the Unload button. The weapon will go to the soldier's right hand and the ammunition to the left. To carry this out, both of the soldier's hands must be empty.</p><p>When you have finished equipping your soldiers, click on the OK button to enter the main part of the Ground Assault; the Battlescape.</p><h4>3.2 THE BATTLESCAPE SCREEN</h4><p>The Battlescape Screen is a 3-D display which allows you to control a small squad of heavily armed XCom soldiers.</p><h4>3.2.1 USING THE BATTLESCAPE</h4><p>Your squad start the mission in their transport craft. The soldier nearest to the craft's exit ramp has a yellow arrow to show that he/she is selected, ready to move out.</p><h4>3.2.1.1 Selecting and Moving Soldiers</h4><p>A 3-D box will appear when you move the Mouse pointer over the Battlescape. To select a different soldier, either click on the button in the Control Bar (see the next section for full details of the Control Bar) or move the cursor box over the required soldier and click. A yellow arrow indicates the selected soldier.</p><p>To move the selected soldier to a destination simply move the cursor box to the destination and click.</p><p>To make the selected soldier turn around without moving along, position the cursor box in the direction you want the soldier to face and press the Right Mouse Button.</p><h4>3.2.1.2 Moving the View Window</h4><p>Move the Mouse pointer to the edge of the screen to move the Battlescape view window up, down, left or right.</p><p>Note: you must take the Mouse pointer to very bottom of the screen under the Control Bar, to move the view window downwards.</p><p>You will notice that there is an edge to the Battlescape map, beyond which everything is black; this is a region into which the aliens will not venture. Aliens do not stray far from their crashed UFO because Earth's atmosphere is hostile to them.</p><h4>3.2.1.3 Line of Sight</h4><p>The Battlescape will only display what is within your squads line of sight. This means that you must seek out the aliens through dark, unexplored areas.</p><h4>3.2.1.4 Using the Split Level View</h4><p>The Battlescape is built up of several levels. These can be viewed individually, allowing you to see behind walls and inside buildings or craft. Click on the diamond 1 button on the Control Bar to break the Battlescape into levels.</p><h4>3.2.1.5 The Turn-Based System</h4><p>The Battlescape operates under a turn-based system. This means that your soldiers will he able to move a certain distance before the message Not Enough Time Units! appears. When all of your squad have used their allocated Time Units, click on the cancelled circle button on the Control Bar to end your turn. When the aliens have completed their moves, it is your turn again.</p><p>The Hidden Movement screen will appear when the aliens are moving out of sight of XCom soldiers.</p><p>However there is an exception to the turn based rule. If you move your soldiers directly into the alien's line of fire, they will take a shot during your turn. Similarly, your soldiers will automatically open fire if the aliens move into your soldiers' line of fire during their turn. See the section of this manual on Opportunity Fire for full details.</p><p>Note: it is best to end your turn when your soldiers are in cover; close to walls or behind large objects.</p><h4>3.2.1.6 Seeing the Aliens</h4><p>When one of your soldiers sees an alien, a pulsing red square will appear in the bottom right of the Battlescape screen.</p><p>Click on the pulsing red square to centre the Battlescape on the alien</p><h4>3.2.2 USING WEAPONS</h4><p>When you can see an alien on the Battlescape, you should use a weapon against it before it gets a chance to fire. Click on one of the Item Boxes on the left or right of the Control Bar to use a weapon.</p><p>A window appears, giving you the option to select from a number of options. These will vary, depending on the weapon Click on the required option to carry out any of the following:-</p><p>Aimed Shot - a carefully aimed shot, requiring maximum effort from the soldier and therefore maximum Time Units. Snap Shot - an un-aimed shot in the target's general direction. This type of shot is only effective at extremely short range, or when using a very powerful weapon (such as a rocket launcher).</p><p>Auto Shot - a three shot burst of automatic fire in the targets general direction. This type of shot can be very effective, especially when used at Short range. Not all weapons are capable of automatic fire, however.</p><p>Prime Grenade - set the timer on a grenade or explosive charge. When you click on this option, a window appears with numbers from 0 to 23. This is the number of turns it will take before the grenade detonates. Click on the required number and either put the grenade down or throw it.</p><p>Note: proximity grenade's do not have a timer, but will detonate when anything (including your soldiers) moves nearby. These should always be thrown to prevent the risk of detonation.</p><p>Hit - strike your opponent with the weapon/object. To do this your soldier must be standing next to the opponent.</p><p>Throw - throw the Weapon/Object. This option is mainly intended for use with grenades or explosives.</p><h4>3.2.2.1 Maximising Your Fire Potential</h4><p>As well as the soldier's ability and the type of shot fired, there are several other factors which determine the accuracy of a shot:-</p><p>Accuracy is increased if the soldier is kneeling.</p><p>Accuracy is decreased if the soldier is wounded or if a two- handed weapon (such as a rifle or rocket launcher) is being fired while the other hand is not free.</p><h4>3.2.3 THE BATTLESCAPE CONTROL BAR</h4><h4>3.2.3.1 The Item Boxes</h4><p>To the extreme left and right of the control bar are the Item Boxes containing a picture of the items held in the soldier's hands. Click on these boxes to use a Weapon/object.</p><h4>3.2.3.2 Ascend/Descend Controls: Up/Down</h4><p>Click on either of these buttons to move soldiers up or down between levels when they are either standing on a gravlift or if the soldier is capable of flight.</p><h4>3.2.3.3 View Next Level Up/Down</h4><p>Click on either of these buttons to view the next level up or down from the level which is currently displayed.</p><h4>3.2.3.4 Map Screen</h4><p>Click on this button to view a map of the mission area. To re-centre the map on another part of the mission area, simply click on the desired position. The white cross in the centre of the screen shows where both the map and the Battlescape are centred. The map will only display one level of the Battlescape at a time. Click on the up or down arrows on the left-hand side of the map to view the next level up or down.</p><p>The map uses symbols to represent the following:-</p><p>Yellow dots - XCom forces</p><p>ace=Arial&gt;Blue dots - alien forces</p><p>Red dots - civilians</p><p>White Crosses - dead aliens or humans</p><p>Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape Screen.</p><h4>3.2.3.5 Stand/Kneel</h4><p>Click on this button to make the selected soldier stand or kneel. The advantage of kneeling is that your soldier is less visible to the aliens and fires more accurately.</p><h4>3.2.3.6 Equip Soldier Screen</h4><p>Click on this button to view the equipment carried on the selected soldier's body or on the ground at the soldiers feet.</p><p>This display is similar to the Equip Squad screen at the beginning of the Ground Assault. The only difference is that the top right of the screen now displays the soldier's remaining Time Units./font&gt;</p><p>Moving weapons and equipment from one location to another uses Time Units. The amount of Time Units required to move an object is dependent on where the item is - removing items from a backpack takes more effort than putting an item on the ground.</p><p>Click on the OK button to return to the Battlescape screen</p><h4>3.2.3.7 Centre Display on Soldier</h4><p>Click on this button to centre the Battlescape on the currently selected soldier's level and location.</p><h4>3.2.3.8 Select Next Soldier</h4><p>Click on this button to select and centre the Battlescape on the next soldier in your squad.</p><h4>3.2.3.9 Select Next Soldier - Deselect Current Soldier</h4><p>Click on this button to select and centre the Battlescape on the next soldier in your squad. The soldier currently selected will be de-selected so next time you click on the icon the soldier will not appear. Use this button when you are happy with the position of a particular soldier.</p><h4>3.2.3.10 Split Level View</h4><p>Click on this button to change how the levels of the Battlescape are displayed. The number on the button will change to indicate:- 1 - Multi level View - everything from the currently selected level downwards is displayed.</p><p>2 - Full View - every level is displayed, regardless of what level is selected. Selecting this will hide any of your soldiers who are behind walls and inside buildings or craft.</p><h4>3.2.3.11 Options</h4><p>Click on this button to call up the Battlescape Options screen. This allows you to select different speeds for animations and scrolling, depending on player preference and the processing speed of your computer.</p><h4>3.2.3.12 End Turn</h4><p>Click on this button to end your turn.</p><h4>3.2.3.13 Dust Off</h4><p>Click on this icon to abort the mission. Only soldiers aboard the transport craft will be saved.</p><p>Note: if you abort an alien base raid, only soldiers in the rooms where you are initially deployed are saved. Aborting the mission during an alien raid of an XCom base concedes defeat to the aliens.</p><h4>3.2.3.14 Reserve Time Units</h4><p>When your soldiers move, they use Time Units which might be needed to use a weapon. These buttons allow you to reserve Time Units for using weapons:</p><p>- click on the top left button to carry out free movement with no limitation</p><p>- click on the top right button to reserve enough Time Units for a Snap Shot. - click on the bottom left button to reserve enough Time Units for an Aimed Shot.</p><p>- click on the bottom right button to reserve enough Time Units for an Auto Shot.</p><h4>3.2.3.15 Rank</h4><p>This is an icon representing the currently selected soldier's rank.</p><p>XCom soldiers may have the following ranks:</p><p>Rookie Captain</p><p>Squaddie Colonel</p><p>Sergeant Commander</p><p>As the soldier's rank improves so too does the skill with which they can fight.</p><h4>3.2.3.16 Soldier Data</h4><p>The name of the selected soldier is shown at the top of this section, with statistics and information regarding the soldier shown underneath.</p><p>These statistics are displayed as both figures and bar charts and are colour coded as follows: Green - Time Units . Orange - Energy . Red - Health Purple - Morale</p><p>Click on the Soldier Data box to view the Soldier Data screen.</p><p>This displays the soldier's name at the top of the screen with the following information:- Time Units - the soldier's remaining Time Units. Time Units are required to carry out everything from walking to firing weapons.</p><p>Energy - the soldier's remaining energy. This will decrease as the soldier carries out energy consuming actions such as Walking through thick grass.</p><p>Health - the soldier's current health. This will decrease as the soldier takes hits from enemy weapons.</p><p>Reactions - the soldier's reactions. This will allow the soldier to take snap shots during the aliens turn.</p><p>Firing Accuracy - the soldier's accuracy at firing weapons. This will increase as the soldier becomes more experienced.</p><p>Throwing Accuracy - the soldier's accuracy at throwing objects. This will increase as the soldier- becomes more experienced. Morale - the soldier's morale. A soldier will lose morale if the battle starts to swing in the alien's favour. If the morale falls below 5O%, there is a chance that the soldier could panic. Bravery - the soldier's bravery. This determines the likelihood of morale decreasing. Armour Status - the soldier's armour status. This will rise as the soldier is equipped with armour manufactured by your engineers. Psionic Strength/Skill - the psionic strength/skill which the soldier may call upon.</p><p>Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape screen.</p><h4>3.2.4 PROMOTIONS</h4><p>At the end of every mission, subject to their mission performance, soldiers will be promoted.</p><p>The rank to which the soldier is promoted is dependent on the following:-</p><p>Rookie - each new recruit begins at this level.</p><p>Squaddie - in order to be promoted to a Squaddie a Rookie must have had some combat experience (cowering in the back of a Skyranger doesn't count!).</p><p>Sergeant - there is one sergeant per 5 soldiers. If a position is vacant the best available Squaddie is promoted.</p><p>Captain - there is one Captain per 11 soldiers. If a position is vacant the best available Sergeant is promoted.</p><p>Colonel - there is one Colonel per 23 soldiers. If a position is vacant the best available Captain is promoted.</p><p>Commander - this is the supreme leader of Xcom forces - there is only one Commander. If there are at least 30 soldiers the best available Colonel will be promoted.</p><p>It does not automatically follow that the higher the rank the better the soldier, although this will tend to be the case.</p><h4>3.2.4.1 The Effect of Rank</h4><p>When officers accompany a mission then the morale of all the soldiers will be boosted and they will be less susceptible to panic. The higher the rank of the officer, the better the effect on the soldier's morale.</p><p>Note: if an officer is killed during a mission it will have a worse effect on morale than if a rookie had been killed.</p><h4>3.2.4.2 Mission Experience</h4><p>When soldiers return from a mission then their abilities may be increased. For a skill to benefit from experience it must be used during combat as much as possible. For example, if a soldier uses a rifle many times then accuracy is likely to improve. Reactions, accuracy, Time Units, throwing accuracy, psionic skill, health, strength, fitness and bravery all benefit from mission experience.</p><h4>3.2.4.3 Morale</h4><p>At the start of each mission each soldier's morale starts at 100%. This will decrease if a soldier is wounded or if fellow soldiers are killed. It will recover if a soldier successfully kills aliens. The decline in morale is reduced by a soldier's Bravery rating - the more brave a soldier is, the less likely they are to panic.</p><h4>3.2.4.4 Panic</h4><p>When morale falls the likelihood of panic increases. When a soldier panics one of three things can happen:-</p><p>A. The soldier freezes, and can do nothing for the current turn. (i.e. he/she will have no Time Units)</p><p>B. The soldier drops his/her weapon and runs away, searching for a hiding place.</p><p>C. The soldier goes berserk and starts firing at random. Panic can also be caused by an alien psionic attack. 3.2.5 WOUNDING.</p><p>A soldier's health is a general indication of well being, but a soldier can also receive wounds. These afflict a certain part of the body as follows:</p><p>Head, Left/Right Arm - each wound reduces the soldier's weapon accuracy.</p><p>Torso - each wound reduces the soldier's rate of Energy recovery.</p><p>Left/Right Leg - each wound reduces the soldier's available Time Units. The soldier data screen displays any wounds. Each wound also reduces a soldier's Health by one point per turn, so that it is possible for a soldier to die from a hit received much earlier in the mission. The Medi kit can heal wounds.</p><h4>3.2.5.1 Stunning</h4><p>Soldiers or aliens can be stunned if hit by a stun weapon or if suffering from smoke inhalation.</p><p>You can monitor the effect of smoke on your soldiers by checking the white bar on the soldier's health bar. If this advances as far as the soldier's health level the soldier will collapse and may recover a few turns later.</p><p>Aliens can also be stunned and carried back to your craft. However, if they wake up they will jump out of the soldier's arms and run away!</p><h4>3.2.6 OPPORTUNITY FIRE</h4><p>If you end your turn leaving your soldiers with enough Time Units to fire a shot, your soldiers will automatically fire during the aliens turn at any alien who strays into their line of sight This is called opportunity fire.</p><p>Your soldiers might even be able to take a shot before the aliens if the soldier's Reactions and Time Units are high enough. There may be several exchanges of fire in each Opportunity Fire confrontation. Note: Opportunity fire is crucial to mission success. Remember to leave your soldiers with enough Time Units at the end of their turn to carry out opportunity fire - use the Reserve Time Units buttons to do this.</p><h4>3.2.7 OBJECTIVE</h4><p>The mission will be successful when all aliens have either been killed or stunned. The UFOs remains, alien artefacts and alien corpses will then be recovered automatically.</p><p>To abort the mission before the objectives have been achieved, click on the button in the Control Bar.</p><p>Note: any soldiers not on the transport at this stage will be left behind.</p><h4>3.3 THE DEBRIEFING SCREEN</h4><p>The Debriefing Screen is displayed at the end of the Ground Assault giving you a breakdown of your mission performance. The first line of this display tells you whether the mission objectives were achieved.</p><p>Below this is the mission performance list, showing a breakdown of all the Items recovered, the Quantity of each and the Score for retrieving them. The last line of the mission performance list shows the total mission score.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen is the overall mission Rating. Poor mission performance may affect XCom funding.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom left of the screen to return to the Geoscape screen.</p><h4>4. BASES</h4><p>Click on the Bases button in the Geoscape screen to access the Bases screen; a display of the various XCom installations in operation or under construction.</p><p>XCom bases are underground facilities, hidden from alien detection systems. Craft operate from concealed hangers and the only access to the base is via the access lift(s). XCom bases carry out several different functions:</p><p>- Detection of UFOs.</p><p>- Operation of XCom fighter and transport craft.</p><p>- Research into alien technology and life forms.</p><p>- Manufacture of vehicles, equipment and weapons for XCom use.</p><p>The Bases screen consists of two main parts: the Base Display and the Menu Options.</p><h4>4.1 THE BASE DISPLAY</h4><p>The Base Display allows you to see, at a glance, the size of your bases and their facilities.</p><p>XCom may have up to eight bases world-wide, these are represented above the Menu Options as a row of eight icons. Each of these icons contain a small map of the facilities which make up the base. Green squares represent existing facilities, red squares represent facilities under construction. Click on any of these icons to select a different base.</p><p>The name of the selected base is displayed in the top right of the bases screen. Below this is the geographical area in which the base is located followed by the total Funds available to XCom.</p><p>The left two thirds of the Bases Screen shows a top down view of the base. Move the Mouse pointer over a base facility to display its name in the top left of the screen.</p><h4>4.2 THE MENU OPTIONS</h4><p>The Menu Options allow you to see in detail how each of your bases is currently functioning. You will use the Menu Options to carry out tasks such as building facilities, aiming individual craft and organising research and manufacture work.</p><p>Note: At times during the game, lists of information may extend beyond the screen. If this happens, an arrow will appear in the bottom right of the screen. Similarly, if the list extends off the top of the screen, an arrow will appear in the top right. Click on these arrows to scroll the list up or down.</p><h4>4.2.1 BUILD NEW BASE</h4><p>Click on this option to establish a new XCom base.</p><p>You will be taken to the Geoscape and the message Select Site For New Base will appear at the top of the screen - click on any part of the world (except the sea) to position the base. You may cancel the order to build a new base by clicking on the Cancel button. Use the Geoscape controls if you want to rotate the display of the Earth (see the section of this manual on The Geoscape Screen for full details of the Geoscape controls)</p><p>When you have selected the location for your base, a message window will appear informing you of the cost to establish a base in this part of the world. Click on OK to accept this location or click on Cancel to select a different location.</p><p>Note: As you play the game, you will find that some areas of the world are better than others for XCom base sites. North America is a good area for an XCom base because it is both large and wealthy.</p><p>When you have decided on your new Base's location you will be prompted to give it a name - type in your bases name using the Keyboard and press the Return Key.</p><p>You will now be taken back to the Bases screen and prompted to Select Position For Access Lift. This will position the main access to the facility from the surface. It is better to position this fairly centrally so that new facilities may be built around it.</p><p>You have now established a new XCom base. Click on the Build Facilities Menu Option to put some facilities into the base.</p><h4>4.2.2 BASE INFORMATION</h4><p>Click on this option to display a breakdown of base-related information.</p><p>The Personnel Available/ Personnel Total data shows how your personnel are being utilised. It is broken down into the three groups of personnel: soldiers, engineers and scientists.</p><p>The figures show the number of personnel available for work followed by the total number of personnel at the base. You should keep the first figure zero to stop workers being wasted. The Bar graphs to the right of this numerical display are useful to see at a glance how your personnel are being utilised.</p><p>The Space Used/Space Available bar graphs shows how your space is being utilised. This is broken down into five categories in a similar way to the Personnel.</p><p>The figures show the space used followed by the total amount of space available. You should be aiming to keep the first figure equal or very close to the second figure to prevent wasted space. The bar graphs to the right of this numerical display are useful to see how your space is being utilised at a glance.</p><p>The Defences is a rating of how well the base can defend itself against UFO attack.</p><p>Click on the transfers button in the bottom of this screen to see a display of the personnel or equipment currently in transit between other bases and the selected base.</p><p>The Item in transit is listed next to the Quantity of that item and its Arrival Time at the base in hours.</p><p>For full details on Transferring personnel and equipment between bases, see the Transfer section of this chapter.</p><p>Click on the OK button to return to the Base Information screen.</p><p>Click on the OK button in the bottom-left of the Base Information screen to return to the Bases screen.</p><h4>4.2.3 EQUIP CRAFT</h4><p>Click on this option to configure your interception craft.</p><p>The Interception Craft Screen lists the following information:-</p><p>Name - the type and registration number of the craft (for example. Interceptor-3 is the third craft to be operated by XCom and is an Interceptor).</p><p>Status - this may be either:-</p><p>Ready - the Craft is available for interception duty. Refuelling - the craft is refuelling.</p><p>Rearming - the craft is having its air-to-air weaponry changed. Repairs - the craft is undergoing repair work.</p><p>Out - the craft is carrying out an interception.</p><p>Weapon Systems - the air to-air weaponry carried by the craft. This is represented as number carried / maximum number which may be carried.</p><p>Crew - the number of soldiers carried on the craft.</p><p>HWPs - the number of Heavy Weapon Platforms (e.g. tanks) carried on the craft.</p><p>To configure a craft, use the Mouse to highlight the required craft from the list and click to enter the Equip Craft screen.</p><p>The Equip Craft screen allows you to configure individual interception craft to suit your requirements.</p><p>The crafts name is at the top of the screen. Below this is a display of the Damage and Fuel status - useful to establish how much longer the craft will be in repair or refuelling. 0% damage and 100% fuel mean that the craft is fully operational.</p><p>Below the Damage and Fuel status are the air to-air weapon configuration buttons, marked with numbers. These do not appear on the Equip Craft screen for the Skyranger transport, since it does not have an air-to-air capability. Craft such as the Interceptor have two weapon bays, marked '1' and '2'. Alongside the numbered buttons are the names of the loaded weapons and a pair of figures:-</p><p>Ammo - the number of rounds of the weapon loaded onto the craft.</p><p>Max - the maximum number of rounds which may be carried by the craft.</p><p>A small icon representing the weapons is shown to each side of the craft.</p><h4>4.2.3.1 The Select Armament Window</h4><p>Click on one of the numbered buttons to access the Select Armament window.
