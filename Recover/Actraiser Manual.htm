Prologue

Opening Story

Generations ago, the world fell into deep Chaos.
The Master had maintained the world in a state of peace and harmony.
However, an evil one called Tanzra began to threaten its very existence.
People spent their lives manifesting their love to their Master while
fearing The Evil One. The Master and The Evil One were eternal enemies. In
strength and power they were almost equals. Even though the world has
fallen into Chaos, somehow the earth continued on its revolving course.
Invasion and destruction...
These were the only aims of The Evil One. To conquer the world was his only
desire. However, The Evil One was unable to destroy the Master. He ordered
his six Guardians, who had enormous strength, to defeat the Master and
conquer his world. Even though the world was still in a state of peace, the
balance of power began to gradually sway towards darkness. One day, The
Evil One and his Guardians suddenly appeared at the outer gates of the Sky
Palace.
The Master, who understood the real purpose of their presence, fought with
great courage and little regard for his own life.
The battle waged on for many days.
The Master was so badly injured that he

fled to the safety of his Sky Palace. With the little energy he had left,
he erected a barricade. To heal his serious wound, he fell into a long and
deep sleep. While in a deep sleep, the presence of the Master's power
vanished. With no one to inspire resistance, the forces of Evil invaded the
world and did as they pleased. With little hope for any support from their
Master, the people had little choice but to be transformed into monsters.
The Evil One divided the world into six lands and turned over the control
of each region to his Guardians.
The world was completely ruined. Stone statues the people had made in honor
of their Master became the only remaining eveidence of a strong and
thriving society.
Several hundred years after the world had fallen into The Evil One's power,
the Master, who had long since retreated to the safety of the Sky Palace,
began to stir. Even though time had completely healed the Master's wounds,
his power disappeared when the last of his loyal subject succumbed to the
forces of evil.
He found his once ideal worldand loyal subject now overrun by evil. This
caused the Master much grief and sorrow, but what could he do? He had no
power.
Inspired by the faintest of hope, the Master revolved battle The Evil One
so that peace and order might once again prevail.

With the final preparations, the Master took down the barrier protecting th
Sky Palace and silently began his mission to destroy The Evil One's hold
onhis earth.

press B-Button whilehoring over that lair. Use the arrows the Angel carries
to destroy the monsters in Simulation Mode. Any contact with the monsters
will decrease the Angel's HP. If his life gauge is completely red (empty),
he will not be able to use the arrow. Time will restore the Angel's HP. The
amount of SP the Angel gains is determined by the numer of monsters
defeated. When the Angel's life gauge is empty, try using some of the
Miracles to effectively rid the land of monsters.



Seal The Monsters' Lairs!

The monsters' lairs can be sealed by developing the land over the lairs.
This, however, can only be attempted once the population of the land has
reached a certain level. The people of Fillmore will offer you a clue as to
what that level will be.



Monsters found in the Simulation Mode.



Napper Bat - Attacks homes and kidnaps people.

Blue Dragon - Uses thunder to destroy homes and other things.

Red Demon - Scorches and dries up productive fields.



- 30 -



Cultural Level

Cutural level refers to the development stage of towns. As the level
increases, the style and quality of homes improve, allowing the population
to increase. The maximum Cultural Level each town can reach is Level 3.
These homes are earthquake-proof.



Advanced Developments

For each land to reach its maximum development level, roads must be
constructed in every possible direction. The more roads you develop the
more homes and fields get developed.



Develop Every Inch Of The Land

Since there are no clues on where offerings are hidden, it is important
that you spend valuable time developing every available piece of land so
your people may find all the offerings each town has concealed.
There are several ways that may help speed a town's progress from level 1
to level 3 (NOTE: By useing the methods listed below, you will sacrifice
the lives of many people.)

* Use lightning or Earthquake to destroy the older homes.
* Allow any fires to burn themselves out.
* Allow the Blue Dragons to destroy the homes for you.

FILLMORE

Fillmore, the first area to be purified, is a land with mild climate and
lush vegatation. Of the six lands, Fillmore proves to be the best suited
for large towns. Take advantage of this to increase your level and gain
valuable experience.



Strategy for Purifying Fillmore

Clearing out the monsters'lair first, proves to be a good starting
strategy. First build a road to the monsters' lair (1). Then do the same
for (2) and (3). You may now move acros the river and seal (4).
Doing this will eliminate all the monsters and allow you and your people to
develop the town to its greatest potential.

           3 BLUE DRAGON             4 NAPPER BAT



To clear the small bushes arpund the shrine, try using 'Lightning'. SP used
in creating 'Miracies' can be recovered by defeating monsters with the
Angel's arrows. To create 'Lightning', push B-Button to open the command
window; select 'Miracles' icon. Use the control pad to select 'Lightning'.
Use the Square on the ground to choose the area you wish to burn.

Lead your people to the monsters' lair.

How to seal the monsters' lair. Press B-Button to open the command window.
Use the control pas to select 'Direct the People' icon. Choose 'Building
Direction' with B-Button. After you are asked about the direction of
development, select the direction by moving the Yellow Square with the
control pad (You may move up to eigth blocks). When a road reaches the
selected location, your people will stop building the town (flashing
blinkers and arrows around the Yellow Square disappear). Repeat this
procedure to lead your people in other directions.

Listen to your people carefully.

In the process of developing a town, disasters may occur. You people will
come to you with various problems. After listing to your people you can
sometimes use 'Miracles' to help them. Example: A fire has broken out in a
town. To put it out simply use the 'Miracles', 'Rain'.



- 32 -



How to use 'Offerings'.

After sealing to the monsters' lairs, direct the people to Point A and they
will offer you a 'Source of Magic' icon. Note: You must take an offering
before you can use it. First, push B-Button to open the command window.
Select 'Offerings', push B-Button to then select the 'Take an Offering'
command.

Pay close attention to all information, not just the building direction.

If you follow the suggestions of your people and cast 'Lightning' on Point
B, the 'Magical Fire' icon will be offered. When the development of his
town reaches a certain point, your people will begin to fish. A 'Source of
Magic' icon will be found and offered.

Acquiring new technology.

When you seal the three monsters' lairs, your people will discover 'Bridge'
technology. With this technology, you can build homes on the other side of
the river. This will enable you to seal the last Monsters' lair (4). Besure
to take the new technology with you into Bloodpool.

Defeat the last Guardian in Fillmore.

After sealing all of the monsters' lairs, your people ask you to defeat
'Minitaurus', the Guardian controlling Fillmore. Return to the Sky Palace
in order to enter ACT II. You must succesfully clear this ACT to restore
peace in Fillmore.

Start ACT II

Push B-Button to open the command window. Select 'Return to Sky Palace'
with the control pas. After returning to the Sky Palace, open the command
window and choose 'Select Magic' under 'Fight'.

If you are having difficulty clearing ACT II try returning to the
Simulation Mode. Build roads across the land. This will help increase your
population. As your population grows, your level will also increase,
extending your HP. This should make ACT II much easier to clear. When you
use the 'Compass' icon acquired in Bloodpool, a 'Source of Life' will be
offered. The 'Compass' can only be used once, the choice is yours.



ITEM LIST

There are seven items that may be acquired in Fillmore 'Bridge' technology
and 'Magical Fire' are the most important.

Bomb!
Strength of Angel
Source of Magic x2

to the lair so they may seal it. Next dry up any marshes with the 'Sun'
rays. Give the 'Bridge' technology to your people by selecting the 'Use
Offering' icon in the Offerings' command. Now you will be able to seal the
monsters' lairs (2) and (3).



                     MONSTERS' LAIR

             1 NAPPER BAT        2 BLUE DRAGON
             3 BLUE DRAGON       4 RED DEMON



Use 'Sun' to clear the marshes.

After sealing the monsters' lair, turn the marshes into green fields by
using the 'Sun' icon under 'Miracles'. When you give your people the
'Bridge' technology acquired in Fillmore, they will build homes on the
other side of the river. At a certain stage in the development of this
town, people begin growing 'Wheat'. Take it as an offering.
'Wheat' may also be planted in Kasandora, Marahna and Fillmore.

Help Teddy!

At a cetain point, the people stop developing the town because they are
woried about Teddy, a boy who has been away from home for quite a while.
You will be offered a 'Load of Bread' from Teddy's mother. Once you find
Teddy, give him the 'Load of Bread'. Upon his return, you will be offered a
'Magic Skull'. This will be needed to seal the final monsters; lair (4).
Make sure you take it with the 'Take an Offering' command. If you cause it
to 'Rain', you will get a 'Source of Life' icon also.

Use the 'Magic Skull'

The monsters' lair is hidden under the bushes. Use the 'Lightning' icon to
burn away the bushes revealing this lair. Now use the 'Magic Skull' icon to
seal it. The water in the lake will then be purified and your people will
begin to fish. A 'Magic Stardust' icon will be found while fishing and
offered to you. After you finshed ACT II, a dispute may occur among your
people. 'Harmonious Music', which you can acquire in Kasandora, will help
resolve this problem. When the population increases to a certain point, the
people invent a 'Compass'.

'Wheat' because it feeds more people than the corn fields.

Bomb!
Wheat
Loaf of Bread
Magic Skull
Compass

KASANDORA

Kasandora is a land covered beneath a vast desert. Water is necessary for
life here. Turn the desert into fertile land with 'Rain' icon under
'Miracles' and the land will begin to develop.



Strategy for Purifying Kasandora

There are no obstacles besides th desert, so start to seal the monsters'
lair nearest the shrine. It will be most helpful if you develop the town in
one direction rather than in several directions.



                 MONSTERS' LAIR

        1 BLUE DRAGON         2 RED DEMON
        3 NAPPER BAT          4 RED DEMON



Use 'Rain' to clear the Desert

Turn the desert into green fields by using the 'Rain' icon under
'Miracles'. Some of monsters' lairs are hidden beneath the sand, so work
diligently to turn the whole desert back in to a fertile land. Now that you
have exposed the monsters' lairs, see that they are sealed up. If you give
the 'Wheat' acquired in Bloodpool, it will help increase the population.

The Birth of Wonderful Music

If you come across some wanderers in the Desert, lead them to Point A, and
they will offer you a 'Source of Magic' icon and 'Harmonious Music'.
'Harmonious Music' has the power to calm people. If a fight breaks out in
Bloodpool, use this item to stop it. If you extended the road to the bottom
of the desert, you will get a 'Source of Magic' icon.

The Appearance of an Ominous Pyramid.

A mysterious Pyramid appears. This will be the battle ground for ACT II.
Before starting ACT II, cause an 'Earthquake' under 'Miracles'. A 'Source
of Life' icon will be offered to you. After clearing ACT II, a plague may
strike Kasandora that only a certain herb can cure (Search Marahna for the
cure). Once the town is developed extensively, you may discover an 'Ancient
Tablet'.

AITOS

Aitos is a mountainous area at the foot of an active volcano. There are
many rocks and bushes, all of which can be removed with the 'Lighting'
command. Clear these obstacles inorder to have a fertile land.



Strategy for Purifying Aitos

The west and southwest sides of the shrine are blocked by rocks and the
northeast side by bushes. Before you start developing the town, burn the
bushes with 'Lightning'. Try and seal the monsters' lairs in the correct
order.



              MONSTERS' LAIR

Beware of 'Skull Head' While Clearing the Land.

Seal the monsters' lairs after clearing away all obstacles. The powerful
demon, 'Skull Head', will appear in Aitos. He is difficult to defeat and
can cause Earthquakes at will. It is best to seal the monsters' lairs in
numerical order. While the level of culture is still relatively low, it is
advisable to make use of the offerings 'Bomb!' and 'Strength of Angel'
while fighting these demons.



Make the Wind Blow to Continue Development.

Soon after sealing up the monsters' lairs, an injured leader will stand in
front of the shrine. If you make it rain om the shrine as he asks, it will
be appreciated. When the level of culture rises, the people will build
windmills. If the people tell you that the windmills have stopped due to
lack of wind, causing development of the town to stop, make the wind blow
with 'Wind' icon under 'Miracles'.



Obtain the 'Sheep's Fleece'.

After sealing the monsters' lair and building a road to the foot of the
mountain, some of the people will start climbing. After a while they will
offer you a 'Source of Magic' icon discovered at the top. With further
development of the town, the people will also offer you a 'Sheep's Fleece'.
Make sure you take this because it will be most useful in Northwall. After
you finish sealing all the monsters' lairs begin ACT II, Good Luck!

'Sheep's Fleece'!

jungle full of palm trees and marshes. Building a town will be very very
tough work. You may accomplish this task by fully utilizing all the
'Miracles'.



Strategy for Purifying Marahna

'Lightning' and 'Sun' miracles. Work hard to uncover and seal up lairs as
soon as possible.

and have little communication, they manage to discover bridge building on
their own.



The Appearance of a Strange Temple

In the process of developing the town, a mysterious temple will suddently
appear on the island. Your people will be captivated by its presence. When

be given here to increase the population.

expedition will leave for the Northeast Island. Burn away the tree at the
Northeast Island with 'Lightning' to help them,and you will be offered the
