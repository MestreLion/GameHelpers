-VERSION HISTORY-
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is currently Version 1.4 of the Croco FAQ/Walkthrough for Super Mario
World 2: Yoshi's Island, Created 8/18/2001.

Version 1.4 - Created 8/18/01
Since this is the FAQ I probably get the most requests to update, I like to
humor my readers every once in a while and give them what they want. This
update includes Levels 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3, as well as some revisions on Extra 3.

Version 1.3 - Created 2/15/01
Happy New Year! I guess I'm a little late, as I am with this update. Guess I
wasn't going to finish up World 3 soon :). Anyway, Levels 3-8 and Extra 3 are
here now, and from now on each of my updates will include 3 levels each (this
means only nine more updates to go! wooo!).

Version 1.2 - Created 12/21/00
After two quick updates, I started on some other FAQs, but I've come back to
this FAQ for another update, due to popular demand and me being such a nice
guy. Aren't I nice? Yes, I know I am. So, bet you're wondering what's new?
Three new levels are covered, levels 3-5 to 3-7. Why didn't I finish all of
World 3 like I usually would? Unfortunately, a leak in a wall soaked my SNES
and TV and I haven't gotten a chance to play it again since. Fear not, I will
be able to play it again shortly. I'll try to fill in these last to levels in
World 3 soon.

Version 1.1 - Created 10/7/00
OK, so I'm just a tad late on my updating, but don't you worry, it's all worth
it. I've added levels 3-1 to 3-4 in this update, complete with every item, 1-Up
and hidden area. Also, several other sections (such as Enemies) have been
updated, so enjoy looking around.

Version 1.0 - Created 9/30/00
I've got the first version up today, with Worlds 1-2 covered entirely. Also up
are Parts 1, 2, and 4, which are complete for the most part. If you need help
with Worlds 3-6, don't worry, as I plan to update soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE NOTICE: Today's update includes Levels 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3, as well as
revisions of Extra 3. Also here are additions to the Enemies and Special
Objects sections.

NEXT UPDATE: The magic eight ball says "Check Me Later"

     Perhaps one of the best games of the 16-bit era, Super Mario World 2:
Yoshi's Island is a very unique game. At first appearance, it may seem a tad
cute, but the challenge and fun involved will please the most experienced
gamers.
     After Super Mario World came out, gamers were hoping for more Mario World
games, much like the trilogy on the NES they had loved. However, it had been
years after the original came out and there was still no sign of a sequel. But
of course, Nintendo greats Shigeru Miyamoto and Takeshi Tezuka, after several
false starts, managed to get out a sequel near the end of the SNES's life.
Gamers were ecstatic about the sequel, yet when they plopped the cartridge into
the slot they discovered that Yoshi's Island was a very different game indeed.
     Despite the "2" in the title, everything in the game was not anything like
Super Mario World. Instead, it was a whole new style of play. Along with tricky
platforming were collectible objects, and if the player wanted to see it all,
they'd have to collect every last item. Also, the game starred Yoshi, not
Mario. Although the changes were drastic and this wasn't the Mario World
everyone thought it would be, the game received praise, and that praise is
well-founded.


    - - - - - - - - - - - - AUTHOR'S COMMENTS - - - - - - - - - - - -

     "Oh no!" I mumbled to myself as I looked at the release date info in front
of me. Ogre Battle 64 wasn't coming out until October! I had recently thought
it was coming out in mid-September. Now this large, ominous gap filled my game
playing schedule as well as my new FAQ Projects. What to do? I had already
taken a break, so I couldn't take another one. Then, like a bolt of lightning,
I got the idea to work on another FAQ from the days of yore, which would fill
up the time before Ogre Battle arrived. But what game? I looked through my
stash of N64 games. Nah. None of them would do. Then I thought "How about an
SNES game?" It immediately came to me that a Yoshi's Island FAQ, would be
great, as it was one, if not the favorite game of mine back in the early
nineties. "Excellent" I muttered as I began work on the largest Yoshi's Island
FAQ around.
     Hey, that was pretty good. Sounded like a nice little story. I'm pretty
talented, aren't I? Yep, I know.


     - - - - - - - - - - - - STORY/CHARACTERS - - - - - - - - - - - -

     The story for Yoshi's Island isn't exactly the best thing one could think
up, but it sets the stage well for baby Mario and Luigi, as well as giving
Yoshi the starring role. Here's the story in my own words, followed up by the
Story from the opening scenes of the game itself.

-CROCO STORY-

Kamek, evil magikoopa and caretaker of the new-born Bowser (successor to the
throne), had heard of news from afar. A pair of twins had been born... but
these were no ordinary twins. Kamek foresaw a grave future if he did not
dispose of them (or at least keep them locked up tight... the story must be
suitable for all ages, ya know), and they could cause great trouble for Bowser.

We all know these twins as Mario and Luigi, plumbers extroadinaire. We also
know that they've defeated Bowser countless times, so Kamek is pretty smart.

Anyways, the twins were just being delivered by the stork (hmmm... perhaps this
story is a little TOO suitable for all ages) as he flew across the night sky.
Kamek knew this was his only chance. He hopped on his broom, and zoomed out of
the castle. He had to do it quickly... and quickly he did. A bit too quickly.
As he raced by, he snatched up one of the babies, but didn't get a firm grip on
the other. He dropped it, and it plummeted down to the sea below. Kamek did not
realize this right away.

The baby (Mario), luckily was falling not towards the ocean but Yoshi's Island,
home to all the Yoshi's. Even luckier, the fall was cushioned by a soft Yoshi
back. Yoshi, who was taking a walk, was surprised to see the baby, and didn't
know what to do with it. He decided to take it back to his friends. The other
Yoshies weren't too sure what to do either, but baby Mario seemed to know. He
wanted to get his twin (Luigi) back from Kamek's clutches and arrive at his
home safely. A special bond (and a map) allowed Mario to know where to go. The
Yoshies decided to pitch in and help take Mario on his adventure - or should we
say, the Yoshies' adventure.

-GAME STORY-

"A long, long time ago..."

"This is a story about baby Mario and Yoshi.
 A Stork hurries across the dusky, pre-dawn sky.
 In his bill, he supports a pair of twins.
 Suddenly, a shadow appears in a gap between the clouds and races toward
 the stork with blinding speed."

"SCREEEECH!!!"
"THE BABIES ARE MINE!"

"WOW!!!"

"Snatching only one baby, the creature vanishes into the darkness from
 whence it came.
 The second baby falls undetected towards the open sea..."

"OH NO..."

"Meanwhile, here is Yoshi's Island, home to all Yoshies.
 It's a lovely day, and Yoshi is taking a walk."

"HUH?!?"

"Suddenly, a baby drops onto his back.
 The baby seems to be fine. This is very fortunate!
 Wha-? Something else fell with the baby...
 Let's take a peek...
 It looks like a map. Maybe the Stork was using it?
 But Yoshi can't figure it out.
 Yoshi decides to talk to his friends."

"AAAAAAAAAAKK!!!"
"Kamek, the evil Magikoopa and kidnapper of the baby quickly dispatches
 his toadies when he realized the other baby was missing."

"Yoshi heads leisurely back to the other Yoshies, unaware of the danger
 at hand.
 Kamek's forces are actively searching the island.
 Will these two children ever be reunited with their parents?"

                                *   *   *

"This paradise is Yoshi's Island, where all the Yoshies live. They are all in
an uproar over the baby that fell from the sky. Wait! The baby seems to know
where he wants to go. The bond between the twins informs them where the other
one is. The Yoshies decide to carry the baby to his destination via a relay
system. Now begins a new adventure for the Yoshies and baby Mario."

-CHARACTERS-
-Yoshies: The Yoshies are the inhabitants of Yoshi's Island, and have decided
to help baby Mario in his quest. The Yoshies come in a variety of colors and
are all helping out. Yoshi, the main Yoshi, is green.
-Baby Mario: Baby Mario, after escaping kidnapping from Kamek, fell down to
Yoshi's Island. All he wants to do is get home, and the Yoshies are willing to
help him out.
-Kamek: The evil Magikoopa is the supervisor of Baby Bowser, heir to the
throne. In order to make his masters life easier, he tried to capture the Mario
Bros. to prevent future interventions. However, he missed Mario, and now he's
sending all his forces in order to capture him.
-Baby Bowser: Actually, Bowser isn't the heir to the throne, he's already King.
He's a tad young to be destroying mighty empires, so Kamek watches over him
until he's old enough. However, just because he's young, it doesn't mean King
Bowser isn't a tough opponent.
-Baby Luigi: Mario's brother, captured by Kamek.
-The Stork: He was delivering the Mario Bros., but was captured along with
Luigi.
-Mario's Parents: They're eagerly awaiting the arrival of their children, but
wonder why they haven't come yet.

       - - - - - - - - - - - CONTROLS & PLAY - - - - - - - - - - -

   The controls in Yoshi's Island are somewhat similar to most other
side-scrolling platformers, but Yoshi has a bunch of unique attacks that you
won't see anywhere else.

~STANDARD CONTROLS~

D-Pad: The D-Pad will move Yoshi around. Press Left or Right to go in the
corresponding direction. By pressing and holding Up or Down, you can scroll the
screen in that direction so you can see things normally out of view. If you
hold down Left or Right, Yoshi will run.

A Button: Press it once to grab onto one of the eggs that follows you around.
The cursor will move up and down. When it gets at the desired location, press A
again to launch an egg. Hold Up to aim an egg straight up. If you press L or R,
the cursor will stop moving until you press it again. If you wish to cancel a
throw once the aiming has begun, press Y.

B Button: A tap on the B Button will make Yoshi leap into the air, complete
with a "boing" sound effect. When in the air, hold B to have Yoshi do the
Flutter Kick, which will keep him up in the air a little while longer.
Sometimes he'll gain a boost in elevation, too, but this usually doesn't
happen. To do the Ground Pound attack, jump into the air, then press Down. With
this move, Yoshi can smash through dirt or pound down posts.

Y Button: Pressing the Y Button once will activate Yoshi's tongue slurp, which
is useful for gulping down enemies, grabbing eggs, and sometimes other things.

X Button: No purpose.

L and R Buttons: While aiming in the egg aim mode (press the A Button), press L
or R to stop the moving cursor. Press it again let it start moving again.

-Alternate Controls-
You can change the control style on the World Map screen. The button is right
next to the score button in the bottom row. The change is only small, but can
help you fire eggs faster.

~GAMEPLAY~

Stars: While Stars are collectible items needed to get 100%, they also
represent sort of a life meter Yoshi, or should I say baby Mario has. You start
out with 10 stars, and can collect more through flowers, clouds, boxes, or
items. When Yoshi gets hit by an enemy, baby Mario goes flying off his back.
Each star counts as a second Yoshi has to retrieve baby Mario. If the timer
reaches 0, Kamek's toadies come and take baby Mario away, resulting in the loss
of a life. If you rescue baby Mario while the number is in the red zone (0-9),
the stars will slowly replenish until they get back up to ten. They will not
replenish above 10. This is a rather ingenious and unique life system.

Coins: Coins, like in other Mario games, are collected. Once Yoshi gets 100,
he'll get an extra life. That's all they're used for. Some coins are Red Coins
in disguise. Red Coins look exactly like normal coins (except for a slight
reddish tone that is very hard to see), but add to your total score at the end
of the level.

Eggs: Eggs are Yoshi's primary weapon. Yoshi can collect eggs either through
egg blocks or enemies. To make an egg, eat an enemy, then press down to
transform it into an egg. Up to six eggs can follow behind Yoshi at a time.
Yoshi can throw the eggs at super-high speeds to knock out enemies, collect
coins, or get items (flowers, buckets, etc.). The eggs come in several colors
as well. A green egg will not give you anything when it hits and enemy/object,
a yellow egg will give you a coin on contact, a red egg will give you two stars
on contact, and a flashing egg will yield a Red Coin. By banking eggs off of
walls, you can upgrade there color to the maximum of red.

Collectible Items: To unlock the bonus games and bonus levels, you much get a
perfect 100 on every level in that world. To get this high score, you must
collect 5 Flowers, 20 Red Coins, and 30 Stars and make it to the end of the
level. Collecting the items is one of the most fun parts of this game.

Bonus Ring: At the end of each level, Yoshi will jump into a bonus ring. The
ring is made up of stones and flowers. Each flower you collect in the level is
put onto the ring at the end. Therefore you can have a 0% (no Flowers) to 50%
(5 Flowers) chance of hitting a flower. If you do, you'll get to play a bonus
challenge, where prizes can be won.


________________________________________________________________________

          - - - - - - - - - - - ENEMIES - - - - - - - - - - -

   There are a ton of enemies that Yoshi and Baby Mario will run into on their
journey. Some are easy, some are tough. Here's the list of all the baddies on
Yoshi's Island.

-Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy             Abilities: Walking
          Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg      Speed: Slow
  Shy Guys are the basic enemies on Yoshi's Island, sort of like the
  Goomba in Mario Bros. Shy Guys come in an assortment of colors, but
  there's no difference in them. They walk around slowly, and don't do
  much else. Other than taking up space, they're basically just easy
  eating targets. When you shoot an egg at them, they'll start rolling,
  destroying any enemies they come in contact with.

-Singing Flower: Difficulty: Easy             Abilities: Walking
                 Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg      Speed: Slow
  Singing Flowers are happy little guys that act much like Shy Guys.
  They sing a song as they walk around, and are a tad more mobile than
  Shy Guys. Still, they don't pose much of a threat and are good targets
  for eating. If you shoot an egg at them, it'll go right through them
  continue on.

-Piranha Plant: Difficulty: Medium Easy   Abilities: Eating
                Defeat: Egg               Speed: N/A
  Piranha Plants are more formidable foes of the earlier levels. They
  are quite good at hiding themselves, remaining a tiny plant until
  their prey gets near. Then they turn into an enormous, chomping plant
  that'll eat anything that comes in their path. Their biggest weakness
  is that they're immobile. If eaten, Baby Mario will fly away while
  Yoshi is trapped in the Piranha Plant's mouth for a few seconds. Even
  worse, Yoshi will drop all of his eggs, and must pick them up before
  they disappear. They can't be eaten, and the only way to kill them is
  with an egg. If they're in their small form, an egg will pass right
  through them.

-Flying Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy        Abilities: Flying
                 Defeat: Eat, Egg        Speed: Fast
  Flying Shy Guys have little helicopter blades on their heads, and
  either hover around an area or quickly zoom down, then back up into
  the sky again. Usually, they carry items such as 1-Ups or Stars.
  Because of their blades, you can't stop them. An egg will pass right
  through them.

-Hopping Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy           Abilities: Hopping
                  Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg    Speed: Medium Slow
  Hopping Shy Guys are a little more jubilant than the normal variety.
  Instead of just walking, they down hops (complete with flips) down
  the path. The only pause after each jump, then hop some more, never
  stopping. Other than this, they're exactly like normal Shy Guys.

-Chomp: Difficulty: Medium        Abilities: Ground Smash
        Defeat: N/A               Speed: Medium
  The Chomp is one of the larger enemies you'll encounter. You can spot
  them far off in the background, but as you approach them, they'll leap
  high into the air and come crashing down onto the land, making a
  bottomless pit. Watch for their shadows so you can avoid them.

-Nipper: Difficulty: Medium Easy   Abilities: Hop
         Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg   Speed: Medium Slow
  Nippers generally dwell in caverns. As plants, they sprout from seeds,
  but can grow very quickly. The will usually float down from the sky as
  mushroom spores, then when they touch the ground, will turn into their
  normal form. The spores can be eaten (they will not produce an egg) or
  shot, but if stomped, Yoshi will get hurt. Their adult form is easier
  to defeat, as it can be stomped. They will often chase after you, even
  dropping from ledges above. Shoot an egg at them and it'll go right
  through them, and spitting them into other enemies will destroy
  both.

-Lantern Ghoul: Difficulty: Easy          Abilities: Walk
                Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg   Speed: Slow
  Lantern Ghouls inhabit caves and dark areas. They're pretty much the
  Shy Guy of the underground world. They walk around slowly carrying
  lanterns, which will also help you see if the cave is dark.

-Falling Wall: Difficulty: Medium Easy    Abilities: Fall
               Defeat: N/A                Speed: Medium
  This is really more of a trap than an enemy, but I'll put it in here
  anyway. Falling Walls, found in the castles, look like any normal
  wall. But when you approach, they fall down onto the round, crushing
  whatever's standing there. It's easy to avoid if you keep an eye out
  for it, but if you get crushed, you'll be in for some trouble.

-Spiked Ball & Chain: Difficulty: Medium  Abilities: Spin
                      Defeat: N/A         Speed: Medium
  Another trap, the Spiked Ball and Chain is pushing around a central
  axis by a group of Shy Guys. It moves at a medium pace, and can
  usually be avoided easily, unless you must stand in the spot for a
  while. Some of them come with another Ball & Chain attached to the
  other end of the first.

-Bouncing Burt: Difficulty: Medium        Abilities: Bouncy Jump
                Defeat: Egg               Speed: Medium
  Bouncing Burts, the smaller cousins of Burt the Bashful, like to
  bounce and jump around a lot. They can jump very high, and prefer
  to travel in pairs (to play leap frog). It's best to take them out
  quickly with an egg, which will upgrade one level on contact.

-Small Lava Flame: Difficulty: Medium Easy    Abilities: Jumping
                   Defeat: Eat                Speed: Medium
  Small Lava Flames live in lava and jump out every once in a while.
  They don't get very high, but they can be a threat if you don't watch
  out for them. If eaten, they serve the same functions as if you had
  eaten a Fire Watermelon.

-Blargg: Difficulty: Medium                    Abilities: Leap
                     Defeat: N/A               Speed: Medium Slow
  OK, if you're wondering where I got the name, I call the Nep-enuts'
  lave-swimming cousin the Lava-enut, and this is a smaller version of
  them... so it makes sense, right? No? Who cares. Who's writing the
  FAQ here? That's what I thought. Anyway, Mini Lave-enuts aren't a big
  threat if you keep moving. They attack those on low bridges of
  platforms over the lava, and will lunge out of the lava trying to hurt
  you.

-Gargantua Blargg: Difficulty: Medium              Abilities: Charge
                   Defeat: N/A (Hurt w/ Egg)       Speed: Medium
  Whoa! This is a big enemy, rivaling the size of the bosses. Like its
  sea-faring cousin, the Nep-enut, these will rise out of the lava to halt
  anyone who is coming through. It will also chase after any
  trespassers if they manage to get by. By throwing an egg at it, it'll
  go back into the lava to hide for a little bit. Be quite and cross the
  lava then.

-Flowerbed Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy          Abilities: Walk
                    Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg   Speed: Slow
  This Shy Guy is exactly like its friends, but it has learned that
  camouflage can help. It'll sit in a Flowerbed, waiting for anyone to
  come running into it. If they don't, it'll get up and walk around with
  its disguise of flowers on. One stomp will rid it of its disguise,
  another will defeat it.

-Stilt Shy Guys: Difficulty: Easy           Abilities: Stilt Walk
                 Defeat: Stomp, Egg         Speed: Slow
  Even these guys are faster than the normal Shy Guys. They walk around
  on stilts, and that's basically it. One stomp will rid them of their
  stilts, though, and they'll just be normal Shy Guys. However, in their
  stilt form, they're a much bigger (or should I say taller) nuisance.
  You can't eat them; a tongue lash will only knock them back (you can
  push them into pits this way). While an egg can defeat them instantly,
  a couple stomps does best.

-Cave Bat: Difficulty: Medium Easy          Abilities: Fly
           Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg          Speed: Medium
  Cave Bats live in caves and hang out of the ceilings until someone
  comes around. When someone does, they take off, flying in an up and
  down motion, making it harder to avoid than the normal enemy. If spit
  out, they simply fly away.

-Rolly Bugs: Difficulty: Easy               Abilities: Roll
             Defeat: Eat                    Speed: Medium
  Rolly Bugs hop around happily, and will turn into little balls when
  you come near. They're completely harmless, and can be used to take
  out other enemies or to grab items with danger.

-Fuzzy: Difficulty: Medium                  Abilities: Dizziness
        Defeat: Eat, Touch, Egg             Speed: Medium Slow
  Fuzzies are the most annoying enemy in the game, and mere contact with
  one makes Yoshi incredibly dizzy (or drunk... or both). This dizziness
  causes the world to sway up and down, and your control over Yoshi is
  difficulty. This makes falling into pits or running into enemies very
  easy, and even when the effects wear off, going back to the normal
  controls with little notice can put you in danger. Take them out from
  a distance with eggs and don't risk it.

-Tap-Tap: Difficulty: Medium Easy           Abilities: Walking
          Defeat: Tap-Tap Contact           Speed: Medium Slow
  Tap-Taps are little, green-nosed spiked balls that walk around with
  a big smile on their face (they know that they're nearly invincible).
  The only way to kill one is to make it bash into another Tap-Tap.
  Fortunately, they usually travel in groups, where eggs and shells can
  easily make them do this. This normal kind of Tap-Tap will walk off
  ledges.

-Red-Nosed Tap-Tap: Difficulty: Medium Easy   Abilities: Walking
                    Defeat: Tap-Tap Contact   Speed: Medium Slow
  Red-Nosed Tap-Taps are just like their friends of the Green-Nosed
  variety, but they are a tad smarter. When they come to the end of a
  ledge, they'll turn around instead of dropping off.

-Mini Milde: Difficulty: Medium Easy        Abilities: Walking
             Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg        Speed: Medium Slow
  Mini Mildes are pink, round enemies that walk around happily. The
  only real difference between them and Shy Guys is that when stomped,
  they create a burst of air that'll shoot anything near it away
  (enemies). You can even stomp more than one at a time! Talk about
  efficient!

-Big Flower: Difficulty: Medium Easy        Abilities: Petal Shot
             Defeat: N/A                    Speed: Immobile
  Big Flowers are happy, humongous plants that have the strange ability
  of launching their petals into the air. To rid it of the deadly
  petals, pound the ground or eat them. When it comes time to launch
  them, it won't have any.

-Slime: Difficulty: Medium Easy             Abilities: Ceiling Drop
        Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg             Speed: Medium
  Slimes live on the ceiling, waiting for an intruder. When one passes
  below it, they drop down in an attempt to take it out. When they're on
  the ground, the move around frantically.

-Bandit: Difficulty: Medium                 Abilities: Mario Snatch
         Defeat: Stomp (x3)                 Speed: Medium Fast
  Bandits are menacing minions of Kamek that will run by Yoshi quickly
  and snatch Baby Mario off his back. If you want Mario, you'll have to
  catch them. It takes three stomps on the head to destroy them, and in
  groups, these guys are real pains. If you shoot them with an egg,
  it'll be upgraded a color on contact.

-Water Spitting Fish: Difficulty: Easy      Abilities: Water Spit
                      Defeat: N/A           Speed: Immobile
  Water Spitting Fish just stay in one place, spitting a high stream of
  water out. This water is like a temporary wall, which is more annoying
  than difficult.

-Bullet Bill: Difficulty: Medium Easy            Abilities: Cannon Shot
              Defeat: Stomp (Cannon: Ice), Eat   Speed: Medium Fast
  Bullet Bills fire themselves out of cannons to try and stop Yoshi. One
  quick stomp on its head will not only defeat it, but give Yoshi a
  boosted jump. To take out the cannon, use an Ice Watermelon.

-Koopa: Difficulty: Medium Easy             Abilities: Walk
        Defeat: Stomp (x2), Eat, Egg        Speed: Medium Slow
  Koopas return from previous Mario games, and they're pretty much the
  same as they were before. One stomp makes them fly out of their shell.
  The shell can be spit or kicked at rather high speeds, and the Koopa
  can be eaten for eggs.

-Para-Koopa: Difficulty: Medium Easy        Abilities: Fly
             Defeat: Stomp (x3), Eat, Egg   Speed: Medium
  Para-Koopas are basically Koopas with wings. They fly in an up/down
  pattern. If stomped, they revert to the normal Koopa form, but if
  eaten or shot with an egg, they're the same as a normal Koopa.

-Batter Boy: Difficulty: Medium             Abilities: Hit Eggs
             Defeat: Stomp (x3)             Speed: Medium Slow
  One of the two different types of Baseball Boys, the Batter is skilled
  at using his bat, and if any eggs come flying at him, he'll
  immediately whack them back where they came from. Getting hit by an
  egg smacked by a Batter Boy will rocket Yoshi backwards, which is
  potentially dangerous.

-Pitcher Boy: Difficulty: Medium            Abilities: Throw Eggs
              Defeat: Stomp (x3)            Speed: Medium Slow
  Pitcher Boys, one of the two types of Baseball Boys, throw eggs at
  high speeds. Getting Hit by an egg will rocket Yoshi backward. They
  sometimes start out with some eggs at their disposal, sometimes they
  don't. It takes them a while to wind up, giving you time to dodge (or
  position where they throw the egg).

-Cactus Plant: Difficulty: Medium Hard      Abilities: Spit Mini-Cactus
               Defeat: Freeze               Speed: Immobile
  Cactus Plants are big, green, spiky plants that spit out high-speed
  Mini-Cacti. It takes them a second to aim, so use this time to dodge.
  They can be stunned by eggs or spat enemies, but freezing them will
  get rid of them for good.

-Cave Mouse: Difficulty: Medium Easy        Abilities: Walk, Jump, Steal
             Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg        Speed: Medium Fast
  Cave Mice aren't aggressive and won't attack anybody who comes into
  their cave, but they do enjoy stealing eggs from you. They move rather
  quickly, jumping sometimes.

-Skull Mouse: Difficulty: Medium Easy       Abilities: Hop
              Defeat: Stomp (x2), Eat, Egg  Speed: Medium Fast
  Skull Mice, much like the Cave Mice, live in caves. This type hops
  around pretty quickly, so time your jumps carefully. It will take one
  stomp to destroy their skull, which will turn them into a Cave Mouse.

-Gusty: Difficulty: Medium                   Abilities: Fly
        Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg              Speed: Fast
  Gusty are clear, cloud-shaped enemies that zoom across the screen for
  a second, then disappear. Because of their speed, they do pose a
  threat, but you should have time to react in most cases. They're great
  for stocking up on eggs, as in a Gusty area an endless supply will
  come.

-Nep-enut: Difficulty: Medium              Abilities: Charge
           Defeat: N/A (Hurt w/ Egg)       Speed: Medium
  Nep-enut (the word Neptune with the second syllable spelled backwards)
  is the behemoth of the watery worlds, bearing a striking resemblance
  to the Lava-enuts of the lava worlds. They rise out of the water, and
  charge at any intruders unless shot with an egg, which causes them to
  retreat to the depths once more.

-Boo Buddy: Difficulty: Medium                Abilities: Follow
            Defeat: Egg (when turned around)  Speed: Medium
  Boo Buddies are essentially the ghosts of Yoshi's Island. They are
  quite shy, and when you face them, they cover up their eyes and stop
  moving. When you turn around, they follow you. Keep them away by
  facing them. They're vulnerable when they're faces are revealed, so
  bounce an egg off the wall to get a star from them.

-Boo: Difficulty: Medium                   Abilities: Follow
      Defeat: Egg (when turned around)     Speed: Medium
  Boo are larger versions of Boo Buddies. Nothing more. This makes them
  easier targets.

-Boo Chain: Difficulty: Medium                Abilities: Follow
            Defeat: Egg (When turned around)  Speed: Medium
  Boo Chains are a Boo followed by several Boo Buddies. They all follow
  you as one, and simply take up more space. If you are skilled, one egg
  can take care of them all.

-Ghost Blobs: Difficulty: Medium Easy      Abilities: Scare
              Defeat: N/A                  Speed: Medium
  Ghost Blobs patrol either the ceiling or floor, and every once in a
  while spring up in a frightened pose. While this pose won't hurt you
  unless you run into the Ghost Blob (you can even stand on top of them
  before they do it and not get hurt), it is something to watch out for.

-Ghost Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy           Abilities: Hover
                Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg    Speed: Medium Slow
  Ghost Shy Guys are just creepier versions of the standard Shy Guy.
  They float around instead of walk, and aside from being a tad faster,
  there's no difference.

-Fire Chain: Difficulty: Medium Hard       Abilities: Rotate
             Defeat: N/A                   Speed: Medium Fast
  Fire Chains can be quite a nuisance. There's a smaller version, and a
  double-sided version. It's quite hard to avoid the double sided one,
  making getting by these things a bit of a challenge.

-Balloon Boo: Difficulty: Medium           Abilities: Fly
              Defeat: Egg (x3)             Speed: Fast
  Balloon Boo are very rare creatures that fly above the ground in
  erratic patterns. If shot three times, they explode and leave a Switch
  that makes coins and/or blocks appear.

-Blindfold Boo: Difficulty: Medium Hard    Abilities: Fly
                Defeat: N/A                Speed: Medium Fast
  Blindfold Boo are similar too Balloon Boo, but are a bit slower and
  can't be destroyed. Watch out for them. They tend to stay near the
  ground.

-Lakitu: Difficulty: Medium                Abilities: Spike Drop, Fly
         Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg           Speed: Very Fast
  Lakitu are returnees from the Mario Bros. games. They fly very quickly
  at the top of the screen, a hurl Spiked Balls at Yoshi at high
  velocity. Simply eat the cloud to get rid of them, or stomp the Lakitu
  and use the cloud as transportation. They almost always will come back
  after a shot period of time.

-Toadie: Difficulty: Easy                  Abilities: Steals Mario
         Defeat: Eat                       Speed: Medium
  Toadies will always grab Baby Mario when the timer reaches 0, but in
  certain areas they'll swoop down and grab him the second he gets
  loose. Don't worry, they won't take him, but just make it harder for
  you to retrieve him. Lick the bubble or eat the Toadie to make them
  go away.

-Catching Cactus: Difficulty: Easy           Abilities: Cactus Catch
                  Defeat: Eat Thrown Cactus  Speed: Immobile
  Catching Cactus look like normal cacti, but they toss a mini-cactus up
  into the air. Eat the mini-cactus to make it slump down (so you can
  get by it). Look what you did. Now it's sad.

-Outline Shy Guy: Difficulty: Medium       Abilities: Chase
                  Defeat: N/A              Speed: Medium
  Outline Shy Guys will chase you when you've transformed into a train
  and are on the tracks in the background. It's usually rather difficult
  to avoid them.

-Cannon: Difficulty: Medium Hard           Abilities: Fire Cannonball
         Defeat: Egg                       Speed: Medium
  Hmm... ever seen a walking Cannon? These special types of cannons walk
  around, momentarily pausing to fire a cannonball, which bounces down
  the path. Shoot these guys with eggs as soon as you see them.

-Gusty Wind: Difficulty: Medium Easy       Abilities: Fly (On Path)
             Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg       Speed: Medium
  Gusty Wind are small, air-bubble creatures that somewhat resemble
  smaller, more round versions of the Gusty. They fly up and down on a
  pre-set path. A quick tongue lash will grab them into your mouth,
  where you can eat them quickly.

-Round Cactus: Difficulty: Medium Easy     Abilities: Drop, Block
               Defeat: Egg                 Speed: Immobile
  The Round Cactus, a happy little blob with an "O" on its chest, falls
  from the sky at the most inconvenient times, usually blocking the
  path.  To get him out of the way, fire an egg at him. He'll roll away,
  and if it runs into anything, a bunch of coins will pop out.

-Wall Lakitu: Difficulty: Medium           Abilities: Spike Ball Throw
              Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg      Speed: Immobile
  Wall Lakitu are basically immobile variations of their flying cousins.
  They pop out of holes in the background walls, and throw Spiked Balls
  at you. Stomp or eat them before they get a chance to.

-Flashing Shy Guy: Difficulty: Easy         Abilities: Take Off
                   Defeat: Eat, Egg         Speed: Medium
  Flashing Shy Guys look intimidating at first, but they're really
  rather harmless. After standing around for a couple of seconds, they
  fly off into the sky. That's it.

-Missile Shy Guys: Difficulty: Medium      Abilities: Missile Drop
                   Defeat: N/A             Speed: Immobile
  Missile Shy Guys work in large groups. They hang out above the ceiling
  where a missile-maker of some sort supplies them with missiles. They
  pass it along until they reach the spot where Yoshi is, in which case
  they drop it. To startle them and make them drop the missile, pound
  the ground (and you get to see the sad Shy Guy who dropped it :).

-Land Goonies: Difficulty: Medium          Abilities: Run
               Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg     Speed: Fast
  Land Goonies run at high speeds across the land. They resemble their
  flying cousins, just without the wings. Stomp or eat them.

-Bubble Flower: Difficulty: Medium Easy    Abilities: Spit Bubbles
                Defeat: Eat, Egg, Stomp    Speed: Slow
  Bubble Flowers resemble their Singing friends, but these have
  specialized in spitting bubbles. Hitting a bubble will knock Yoshi
  back (and high up into the air if he jump on one), and if he eats one,
  he can spit them himself (though the bubbles won't defeat many
  enemies).

-Sumo Shy Guy: Difficulty: Medium Easy     Abilities: Walk/Run
               Defeat: Eat, Egg            Speed: Medium Slow, Medium
  Sumo Shy Guys are gigantic variations of their normal kin. When eaten,
  they'll produce a large egg. When a large egg is thrown, the moment it
  touches the ground it has the same effect of a POW block (turning
  enemies into stars). If you jump on a Sumo Shy Guy's head, it'll speed
  up in a frantic frenzy.

-Monkey: Difficulty: Medium Easy           Abilities: Jump, Climb
        Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg            Speed: Fast
  Monkeys are a common enemy in World 3, appearing in many of the jungle
  settings. If they get a chance, they'll steal Baby Mario (similar to a
  Bandit), but they'll usually just hop away when you get close. To get
  rid of them, stomp them once, then run through the side of them. You
  can also eat them in even less time.

-Throwing Monkey: Difficulty: Medium        Abilities: Throw Object
                  Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg   Speed: Immobile
  Throwing Monkeys hold onto the sides of trees, and occasionally drop
  an object (either a Mini Cactus or Missile) at Yoshi. The easiest way
  to beat them is to eat them, but be forewarned that if you eat them
  after they pull out an object, it'll fly out of their hands and
  possibly at you.

-Watermelon Monkeys: Difficulty: Medium        Abilities: Spit Seeds
                     Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg   Speed: Fast/Immobile
  Watermelon Monkeys are like one of the two kinds previously mentioned
  (they either run around or hold onto a tree/vine), but they come with
  a Watermelon and aren't afraid to spit a few high-speed seeds at you.
  Defeat them like any other Monkey, just be more cautious when
  approaching them. Once the Monkey is disposed of, you can slurp up the
  Watermelon, although it won't yield as many seeds.

-Swinging Monkeys: Difficulty: Medium      Abilities: Swing
                   Defeat: Get Hit         Speed: Medium
  Swinging Monkeys are groups of several Monkeys that grab onto each
  other and make a swinging Monkey chain. If they touch you, one Monkey
  will grab Baby Mario and run. The good thing, though, is that the
  Monkey Chain will be destroyed.

-Jumping Fish: Difficulty: Medium Easy     Abilities: Jump, Swim
               Defeat: Eat, Stomp, Egg     Speed: Medium
  Jumping Fish patrol certain waters, jump out randomly to attack
  anybody above. A quick stomp will get rid of them, and even if their
  jumping a stomp will work. A variation of this kind will continually
  jump forward, or back and forth in a sem-circle pattern.

-Spear Shy Guy: Difficulty: Medium Easy    Abilities: Block, Walk
                Defeat: Eat, Egg           Speed: Medium Slow
  Spear Shy Guys are pretty much Shy Guys that can't be attacked from
  the front or above. Their spears prevent you from stomping them, and
  their shields prevent you from attacking from the front. Sneak up
  behind and eat/egg them or you'll have some pesky enemies to avoid.

-Cannibal Shy Guy: Difficulty: Medium Hard   Abilities: Dance
                   Defeat: Eat, Egg          Speed: Medium
  Cannibal Shy Guys are funny little creatures, natives of World 3 like
  the Spear Shy Guys. They, however, prefer to dance around instead of
  patrol. Their dance makes them move in a strange pattern, making them
  a bit harder to get by than the Spear Shy Guys. Also, their spears are
  much longer. You can tell when they're near by their chants.

-Watermelon Seed Shy Guy: Difficulty: Medium Easy   Abilities: Spit
                          Defeat: Eat, Egg          Speed: Immobile
  The Watermelon Seed Shy Guy appears in only one level, and even then
  he doesn't really serve much purpose. When you jump on it's head,
  it'll flatten out and spit out Watermelon seeds at any nearby enemies.
  Cool, definitely, but rather useless.

-Cheep Cheep: Difficulty: Medium Easy      Abilities: Swim
              Defeat: Torpedo              Speed: Medium
  Cheep-Cheep, one of the few underwater enemies, generally mind their
  own business, but if they catch sight of you, they'll charge. Fire a
  torpedo before they get the chance.

-Bloober: Difficulty: Medium Easy          Abilities: Swim
          Defeat: Torpedo                  Speed: Medium Slow
  Bloobers inhabit the ocean depths that you explore in the submarine
  transformation. They're slower than Cheep-Cheep, and tend to calmy
  float around instead of attack you. They just get in the way. Clear
  them out with some torpedos.

-Puffer Fish: Difficulty: Medium           Abilities: Expand
              Defeat: N/A                  Speed: Slow
  The Puffer Fish lives in the deep sea as well, simply floating in a
  single spot, not minding submarine Yoshi passing by. However, if it's
  attacked (i.e.- shot with a torpedo), than it'll puff up to more than
  twice its normal size and try to hurt Yoshi. Just be sure to be on the
  lookout for them when you fire the torpedos.

-Froggy: Difficulty: Medium                Abilities: Jump, Slurp
         Defeat: Eat, Egg                  Speed: Medium
  Froggies hop around jungle areas. It's hard to predict when they
  will jump next, so always be on your guard. Sometimes they lash out
  their extra-long toungues to grab Baby Mario from Yoshi. Eat them as
  soon as you see them to prevent any harm.

-Giant Crab: Difficulty: Medium            Abilities: Scuttle, Claw
             Defeat: Egg (x3)              Speed: Medium Slow/Medium
  Giant Crabs live in the lush jungles of World 3, and will slowly
  scuttle along. If they happen to spot Yoshi in their path, they charge
  and use their claw (which grows to a large proportion) to try and bash
  Yoshi. They have very tough skin, and it'll take three shots with eggs
  to defeat one.

-Fake Flower: Difficulty: Medium           Abilities: Drop, Roll
              Defeat: N/A                  Speed: Medium Fast
  Fake Flowers somewhat resemble more evil-looking versions of the
  collectible Flowers, signified by their evil grimaces. When
  approached, they drop down from the sky and roll at Yoshi. Don't be
  hasty and immediately think it's a real Flower or you'll pay the
  consequences.

-Cactus Piranha Plant: Difficulty: Hard    Abilities: Spit Mini-Cactus
                       Defeat: Egg x3      Speed: Immobile
  The Cactus Piranha Plant spits three Min-Cacti at a time, each going
  a different distance, than pausing for a second. It will take three
  eggs to defeat this mean guy, or more conviniently, three watermelon
  seeds.

-Harry Hedgehog: Difficulty: Medium Hard   Abilities: Growth (Spines)
                 Defeat: Eat, Egg          Speed: Medium Fast

  Harry the Hedgehog only populates one level in World 3, but you'll be
  thankful as it's a rather menaceing foe. You cant stomp it, and
  whenever you come close to it, it'll grow enormous spines on its
  otherwise tiny back. They're also pretty fast, so defeat these guys
  quickly before they can stick you.

-Catfish: Difficulty: Medium               Abilities: Swallow
          Defeat: N/A                      Speed: Medium

  The Catfish is a large enemy that lives in water (duh). This guy pokes
  his eyes out when you come near, then retreats to the lake to get
  momentum for his attack. What's his attack? Swallowing you hole. If
  you see this guy in the water, don't go in or there's a chance he'll
  eat you. Him eating you results in an automatic loss of life.

-Bubble Guy: Difficulty: Medium Easy       Abilities: Walk, Bubbles
             Defeat: N/A                   Speed: Medium
  Bubbles Guys are cute little purple creatures that walk around
  frantically, and can only hurt you by running into you (they don't
  seem to do this intentionally). Much like Bubble Flowers, these guys
  can spit bubbles. However, they will only do so if you stomp on them.

-Tunnel Boo: Difficulty: Medium             Abilities: Spit, Extend
             Defeat: N/A (shrink with egg)  Speed: Medium Slow
  Tunnel Boos inhabit small tunnels, and if you don't have full eggs,
  will spit out Shy Guys. Since they take up the entire tunnel, the
  only way to get by them is to shoot eggs at them, causing them to
  scooch back. Enough eggs (usually 6) will get them back far enough.

-Room Boo: Difficulty: Medium              Abilities: Spit, Grow
           Defeat: N/A (shrink with egg)   Speed: Immobile
  Room Boos are very similar to Tunnel Boos, except they large rooms.
  To shrink their immense girth, you must throw eggs at them. Five egg
  shots is enough to get over.

-Path Piranha: Difficulty: Medium Hard      Abilities: Chomp, Patrol
               Defeat: N/A (stun with egg)  Speed: Medium
  Path Piranhas patrol fixed paths, and when they encounter you, will
  swallow Yoshi for a few seconds. An egg will cause them to stop
  briefly, but there usually isn't enough room to get by them. It's best
  to just be patient and let them pass.

-Scuba Lakitu: Difficulty: Medium          Abilities: Spike Drop
               Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg     Speed: Immobile
  Scuba Lakitu are just like normal Lakitu, but they are found in
  shallow waters. They duck down to hide then splash out to throw a
  spiked ball at Yoshi.

-Ravens: Difficulty: Medium Easy           Abilities: Run
         Defeat: Stomp, Eat, Egg           Speed: Fast
  Quoth the raven: "these guys are easy to beat, but eating them won't
  give you an egg... they're pretty fast too."

-Mad Butterflies: Difficulty: Medium       Abilities: Fly, Anger
                  Defeat: Eat              Speed: Medium (Fast when angered)
  Mad Butterflies remind me of the caterpillars from Super Mario World in both
  appearance and attitude. When you just walk by, they're nice and happy. But
  stomp their heads and they burst out in rage. You can eat these guys fairly
  easily.

           - - - - - - - - - - - ITEMS - - - - - - - - - - -

   Here's a list of all the items you can collect in the Bonus Challenges. To
use them, enter the pause screen. Along the bottom bar are three squares. If
you have any items, they will appear in these (scroll over to find more). Press
A to use them. They will come in handy, so stock up.

+10 Stars: This is an incredibly handy item, and is especially useful
   when you're at the end of a level and are short a few stars. Just
   select it, and you'll immediately get ten more stars. Unfortunately,
   this (and any other item) can't be sued while fighting a boss).

+20 Stars: The +20 star item is just like the +10, but it'll instead
   give you 20 stars.

Full Eggs: This is another handy item. In many situations, you may run
   out of eggs but need an egg to get some out of reach item. Simply
   go to the menu and select the eggs, and it'll fill you up to the
   maximum of six eggs.

Cloud: The cloud is a more tedious method of gaining stars, but
   depending on the number of enemies on the screen, can gain you more
   stars than normal. The cloud item will transform any enemies on the
   screen into clouds, which, when shot with an egg will burst open
   with 5 stars. In certain circumstances, something special may occur
   (See Part 4, Section B).

POW Block: This is yet another way of gaining additional stars, but like
   the Cloud item, will also get rid of enemies. With the POW block,
   however, you won't need to waste eggs as any enemies on the screen
   will turn into a star. This means less stars than with the
   Cloud item, though.

Green Watermelon: The Green Watermelon is the basic watermelon. When
   used, you'll get a limited amount of watermelon seeds to spit out at
   enemies. It's also useful for destroying dirt or hitting "?" Clouds.

Red Watermelon: The Red Watermelon is a very nice weapon. When you use
   it, a powerful stream of flames will burst from Yoshi's mouth. Use it
   to defeat enemies, activate ? Clouds, or melt ice blocks.

Blue Watermelon: The shiny, Blue Watermelon is the last of the bunch.
   It's powers are similar to the Red Watermelon's, except that when it
   touches an enemy, they freeze. Yoshi can then stomp then and they'll
   shatter. While it can't destroy ice blocks, it can take out some
   of the foes the Red Watermelon can't.

Magnifying Glass: If you're having trouble locating the Red Coins
   (although you shouldn't with this FAQ), switch on the Magnifying
   Glass. Any coins that are Red Coins will appear in their true form
   (when they're the color red). This is helpful in knowing which coins
   you should go after and which you should leave be.

________________________________________________________________________

      - - - - - - - - - - - SPECIAL OBJECTS - - - - - - - - - - -

   Special Objects are places and things found around Yoshi's Island that Yoshi
can interact with in some way. All of the Special Objects have a purpose, but
exactly what they do and how they'll help/harm you is explained in this
section.

-Purple Yoshi Block: The Purple Yoshi Block is a square block that is
 the same design of a Yoshi Egg, but colored purple. When Yoshi jumps up
 and smashes it from underneath, it'll grow into a much larger block,
 allowing Yoshi to access new places he couldn't reach before.

-Small Arrow Ball: The Small Arrow Ball is very bouncy. When Yoshi jumps
 on it, he'll bounce. If you press B when he's on it, he'll rocket up
 into the sky. A Small Arrow Ball will allow Yoshi to jump twice as high
 as he normally could.

-Large Arrow Ball: Large Arrow Balls have the exact same purpose as a
 Small Arrow Ball, but you can jump four times as high as you could
 normally (twice as high as the Small Arrow Ball).

-"?" Cloud: This cloud with a question mark is sort of like the ? Block
 of Yoshi's Island. When shot with an egg, these clouds will either
 burst open with some special item or lose their wings and fall to the
 earth, causing some change in the environment. It's almost always
 helpful to throw an egg at these. Those that contain stars will be
 referred to as "Star Clouds" in this FAQ.

-Outline Stairs: These are activated by shooting certain "?" Clouds.
 They appear only as an outline at first, but are transformed into
 stairs if the cloud is shot.

-Egg Block: Egg Blocks will give you eggs. A green Egg Block is filled
 with an infinite amount of green eggs, and up to the max of six can be
 knocked out. Yellow or Red Egg Blocks, when smashed, will turn into an
 egg of the corresponding color.

-Star Tulip: These gargantuan tulips float in the air, and are more than
 just pretty flowers. When an egg, enemy, or shell is thrown into the
 top of them, they'll shoot out eight stars for you to collect.

-Rotating Platform: These contraptions are made up of four platforms
 that rotate around a central axis. One kind rotates by itself, while
 another requires Yoshi's weight to get it moving.

-Growing Flower: The growing flower is very helpful in reaching high
 places. The seed for the large flower resides in a "?" Cloud. When
 shot, it'll fall to the ground and a flower will soon sprout out of the
 earth. Climb the leaves on the side to go up it.

-Pipes: Pipes, like in all other Mario games, will lead you to another
 area, which is usually underground. Some pipes don't allow you to enter
 them.

-Enemy Pipe: While the word "enemy" makes it sound like this contraption
 is bad, it is actually intended for good purposes. When Yoshi is low on
 eggs, an enemy will hop out of the pipe. Yoshi can then eat it to get
 an egg. Up to six enemies will come out, depending on how many eggs
 Yoshi needs.

-Face Block: If you're new to the game, it's a good idea to hit the Face
 Blocks. When hit, they'll give you helpful hints and information.

-Chomp Rock: The Chomp Rock is a large boulder that Yoshi can push
 around. It can plow through almost any enemy, so its quite helpful as a
 shield for Yoshi, especially when going downhill. If the rock is up
 against a wall, stand on the one side to get it to start rolling.

-Transformation Bubble: When Yoshi touches one of these, he'll transform
 into the vehicle shown on the bubble (See Part 2, Section F for
 Transformations).

-Balloon: Balloons carry items, such as Coins, 1-Ups, and Keys.
 Sometimes three balloons join together to carry a crate. Shoot them
 with an egg of lick them with your tongue to get the item. They float
 to the left slowly, so it shouldn't be a problem.

-Middle Ring: The Middle Ring is a ring of stars located somewhere in
 the middle of the level (some levels have none, some have more than
 one). When you jump into it, you will start at that point (rather than
 the beginning) if you die. As a bonus, you get 10 stars.

-Blockers: These things look like two pinball flippers, but their
 purpose is different. Instead of knocking you into the sky, they allow
 you access from one way, but not the other.

-Posts: Posts are abundant in Yoshi's Island. They stick into the ground
 and can be pounded down for a number of reasons, usually to find any
 Red Coins that may be hidden inside of them.

-Secret Cloud: A Secret Cloud is actually the same thing as a "?" Cloud.
 The difference is that a secret cloud is not readily visible. To make
 it appear, Yoshi must either run over it or push a Chomp Rock/Snowball
 over its location. Sometimes only one of the methods works.

-Crate: Crates contain a special item, usually either six Stars or a
 Key. To break them open, do a ground pound attack.

-Switch: The red switches will make a hidden warp available when
 stomped, indicated by a flashing red arrow. Stand under the arrow and
 press down, as if you were entering a pipe. This will lead you to a
 bonus area.

-Bucket: Buckets come in two forms: one that spins around when shot,
 releasing five coins. The more helpful type will fall down into the
 water/lava beneath it, providing Yoshi a safe ride across.

-See-Saw: These are very large versions of See-Saws, that work the same
 way. When you stand on one end, the other rises. Quickly dash to the
 other side to reach new heights.

-Locked Door: A Locked Door leads to a new area, or possible a
 Mini-Game. Find the key to unlock it.

-Key: Use the Key to unlock the Locked Door.

-Flower Pot: Flower Pots can be broken if they're dropped off a ledge,
 and contain coins or sometimes a key.

-Egg Flower: The Egg Flower is a strange flower that produces eggs.
 It's basically a way to get a refill on eggs. It'll spit them out of
 the top, and if Yoshi wants the eggs, he must catch them.

-Donut Lift: The classic Sky-object from Mario 3 and Mario World, the
 Donut Lift makes sure you don't dawdle. If you stand on one for more
 than a brief moment, it'll plunge into the sky below. Keep moving and
 jumping so they don't fall.

-Guided Platform: Guided Platforms are like any other platform, but they
 follow an outlined path that you can see. They come in different colors
 depending on the speed they move. Green is slowest, Yellow is medium,
 and Red is fast.

-1-Up Balloon: This is a very uncommon item. If eaten, Yoshi will get an
 extra life. If touched, he'll get hurt.

-Arrow Globe: The Arrow Globe is a round, spinning ball with an arrow on
 it. When Yoshi jumps on it, it begins moving in the direction that it
 is pointed. Use it to cross bottomless pits or get to a very high
 location. The blue variety will wear out soon after it has been used.
 To transport it, keep it in your mouth (eat it).

-Roller: I can't think of any better name for this spinning... things.
 See? You can jump on top of them, but if you stand there, it'll roll
 and you'll fall off.

-Ghost Platform: Ghost platforms are platforms on a ghosts head. They
 move in strange patterns and usually fairly quickly.

-Spike Switch/Spike Platform: Spike Platforms are all nice and safe on
 one side, but on the other spikes rest. A Spike Switch will control
 which side faces up.

-Poochy: The faithful canine Poochy can run through anything: lava,
 spikes, enemies, you name it. He can also jump high, and you can jump
 off his back, giving you more than double the height of a normal jump.
 To control him, just tap the direction you want to go. If he's going
 too fast, just tap the other way to slow him down.

-Super Mario Star: This star bounces around, and when touched, Baby
 Mario will take command. With the star, Baby Mario has a bunch of
 abilities. First of all, he's invincible, and touching any enemy will
 make them explode. Second, he has the power to float with his cape,
 slowing decents (hold B). Finally, he can run up walls. The only
 problem is that this form doesn't last very long and you'll have to
 find a constant supply of Super Mario Stars if you want to keep the
 form.

-Falling Blocks: These are large, gray-colored blocks, that fall to the
 earth, crushing anything beneath it and providing extra height to those
 above it. They also play the role of collapsing bridges, as many times
 you must run across a bottomless pit as these descend.

-Arrow Cloud: When shot with an egg, the Arrow cloud will fire the egg
 at a high speed in the direction it's pointing. Sometimes the arrow in
 the cloud moves, and you'll have to time it right (wait until it is one
 position before the desired position until letting go).

-Lava, Spikes, and Spikey Rocks: These red, tan, and blue/gray objects
 are very dangerous, as one touch will automatically defeat Yoshi.
 Approach with caution.

-Lava Log: Jump on these, and they'll slowly move across the lake of
 lava that they float it.

-Teetering Log: These logs are held up only by the pointed end of
 another log. Stand on one side for too long, and it'll fall.

-Timed Platforms: These are big, red objects with a number on them. The
 number represents how many times you can jump on them before they
 disappear. They subtract a number each time you jump off.

-Mama Duck: Mama Duck waddles around with here babies following behind
 her, which can be only one to quite a few. When you stomp her, she
 loses cotrol of her babies. If you grab them, they'll serve as
 boomerang eggs. When thrown, not only will they come back, but they'll
 go through objects (as opposed to eggs exploding on contact), making
 them much better than the normal egg. However, their distance is
 limited, so for far away objects you'll still need eggs.

-Swinging Platform: These platforms swing around a central point, which
 is identified by what looks like an egg block. Jump on it as it comes
 around. It's speed will remain constant.

-Platforms Blocks: These checkered blocks, when hit, will transform into
 platforms that move either up and down or left and right. It's always
 beneficial to activate these.

-POW Block: POW Blocks are very powerful and will turn any nearby enemies into
 Stars for you to collect.

-Timed Platforms: These platforms are small and allow you to step on them, but
 only a certain number of times. The number on the platform indicates how many
 times you can step on it before it disappears.

-Balloons: Balloons will gradually float higher. You can use them to hitch a
 ride to area above you. Another kind of balloon can be blown up and you can
 ride it horizontally as it lets out air and becomes smaller.

      - - - - - - - - - - - TRANSFORMATIONS - - - - - - - - - - -

   One of the coolest aspects of Yoshi's Island is Yoshi's ability to transform
into cool vehicles. The vehicles offer a quick and beneficial mode of
transportation. The goal while in vehicle form is to make it to the Yoshi Block
at the end, but also to collect any items that you can get while in that form.
To prolong the period that you're transformed, go through another
Transformation Bubble.

Helicopter: The Helicopter is the only transformation that allows Yoshi
   to fly. It doesn't have any special features, but flying is pretty
   helpful in itself. It can move quickly, but it turns around slowly
   and does not change altitude easily.

Mole Tank: The Mole Tank is the underground transformation. The Mole
   Tank can dig through dirt, collecting coins and items buried their.
   It moves slowly, but can also drive up walls and on the ceiling.

Train: Although the Train can move along the ground, its main function
   is to ride along tracks in the background. In the foreground, it can
   move fairly quickly. The unique function of the train, though, is to
   go into the background and ride along the tracks, collecting coins
   and items there. As a transformation, it rate low, but is needed to
   collect items in several levels.

Submarine: The Submarine is the only transformation with a weapon, and
   the only one that can travel underwater, too. It's not very fast, and
   it maneuvers poorly, but the torpedoes it shoots homes in on enemies
   and takes them out quickly.

Car: The Car is the speediest of the land transformations, and is used
   to zoom across the countryside. It's special function is to rise
   high above the ground on stilts, collecting items above and avoiding
   enemies below).

________________________________________________________________________

        - - - - - - - - - - - MINI-GAMES - - - - - - - - - - -

   In many of the levels, you may come across a locked hut. Inside is a special
mini-game, but you must find the key to get inside. Once you do, the Bandit
inside will challenge you to a game of skill.

-Throwing Balloons (4)-
This is one of the more common, but less fun Mini-Games. Yoshi and the Bandit
toss a balloon to each other as it continues to grow. When it gets to big,
it'll pop, and whoever's holding it loses. To toss it back, Yoshi must perform
a sequence of button presses (for example A, B, Down, Left). After he presses
the four correct buttons, he throws it to the Bandit. There's also a timer, and
if you fail to press the buttons fast enough, you must start over. The best
strategy is to hold it until it's about to pop, then toss it to the Bandit.
However, you can also take the hot potato strategy and just try holding it for
the least amount of time possible.

-Throwing Balloons (6)-
This version of the balloon toss plays exactly the same as the Balloon Toss
(4), but is a tad more challenging. Instead of a sequence of four buttons you
must press, there are six. Also, the timer is a bit longer.

-Popping Balloons-
Popping Balloons is a fun Mini-Game, but is more luck-oriented that the others.
The room is filled with several levels of balloons, and one contains a prize.
You must go around the room popping the balloons (by doing the ground pound)
and find the right balloon before the bandit. Just be as quick as you can and
hope for the best.

-Gather Coins-
In Gather Coins, a cannon is placed at the top of the screen, moving back and
forth across the room. Every few seconds, it'll shoot a coin out. Whoever grabs
it first gets the coin. Whoever has the most coins at the end wins. Yoshi has a
huge advantage over the Bandit with his extra-long tongue that can grab coins
right after they shoot out. Another good strategy is to bounce off the Bandits
head, not only delaying him but giving you enough height to grab the next coin
when it first comes out.

-Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest-
This is one of the more challenging games, as it requires the most skill. The
room is filled with pots that will bring out watermelons. Once collected, Yoshi
can spit the seeds at his opponent, slowly depleting his life meter. The
opponent hides behind the walls, however, only coming out to try and spit at
Yoshi. Hit him as soon as he comes out, then watch out for the seeds he spits.
If you see a Red Watermelon, quickly spit out your remaining seeds and grab it,
as one hit with that baby will kill your opponent.

________________________________________________________________________

     - - - - - - - - - - - BONUS CHALLENGES - - - - - - - - - - -

   The Bonus Ring at the end of every level decides whether or not you get to
participate in a Bonus Challenge. The more Flowers you collect, the better your
chances. If the roulette-like ring lands on a Flower, you'll get to play.
Unlike the Mini-Games, the Bonus Challenges are games of chance rather than
skill.

-Flip Cards-
This is one of the better games for items. A 3x3 grid of cards is set up (the
center being the Exit card). There are three types of cards: Items, Toadies, or
Kamek. Select a card and shoot it to see what it is. If it's an Item, you'll
get that item. If it's a Toadie, nothing will happen. If it's Kamek, you lose
the game (including all the Items you received). It's best to exit after you
get two items or one really good item. If you manage to get every item without
overturning Kamek, you'll get a bonus 10-Up.

-Scratch and Match-
Scratch and Match is the basic 1-Up game. There are seven square tiles, and
like a lottery card, can be scratched to reveal a prize. If a Baby Mario is
unveiled, it's good. A Toadie is bad. You get three scratches to uncover as
many Baby Marios as possible. If you uncover one, you get a 1-Up, two, you get
a 2-Up, and three, you get a 5-Up.

-Drawing Lots-
The Drawing Lots game is quick and simple. There are six squares. Three contain
items, and three are Kamek. You win the item if you select it, you lose if you
get a Kamek.

-Match Cards-
This game is by far the best of them all, as you have a good chance of getting
a bunch of items and a 10-Up. All it requires is a decent memory. When the game
begins, you get to see where all the cards are, but are quickly turned over. If
you can match two of the same card, you'll win the item. The last match is
always a 10-Up instead of the cards it appeared as before. It's best to
remember where the best items are, and get them first. If you can remember
where four matches are (eight cards total), you'll have a good chance of
winning. If someone else is around, have them remember where some are, too.

-Roulette-
Roulette is the only game that you can lose something in. When it begins, you
bet a certain amount of lives (you can't bet your last life, though). Then you
start the wheel, then stop it. On the left are multiplication and addition
signs. On the right are numbers 0-3. The equation you land on is what you get
(example: you bet 5 lives, and the cursor lands on + and 2, so you get 5+2 or 7
lives). If you get x2 or x3, you'll get a bunch of extra lives, but if you get
x0, you'll lose all the lives that you bet. Getting x1 or +0 will give you back
your lives, while +1, +2, or +3 will give you a few extra lives.

-Slot Machine-
The Slot Machine is the hardest Bonus Challenge to beat, and even if you do
win, the lives you get aren't that numerous. It's basically like any slot
machine; you control when it stops spinning. Getting three 7s will give you a
5-Up, three Eggs will give you a 3-Up, three Cherries will give you a 2-Up, and
a Shy Guy, Star, and Watermelon (in that order) will give you a 1-Up.

~LEVEL 1-1: MAKE EGGS, THROW EGGS~
Type: Normal          Difficulty: Easy          Yoshi Color: Green
No. of Coins: 74      No. of Stars: 23          No. of "?" Clouds: 6
Enemies: Shy Guy, Singing Flower, Piranha Plant, Flying Shy Guy, Hopping
   Shy Guy
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is pretty easy to find everything, but I'll walk you through it just
in case. Run through the fields, and you'll soon see a Flower above. Stand on
the rock to the right of it to jump to it, or shoot an egg at it. Continue
through the field until you come to a floating platform. Above is a "?" Cloud
and an Outline Stairs. Shoot the cloud to make the stairs appear, then go up.
There are six Red Coins up here, as well as a Flower. Jump over to the platform
behind it and a Flying Shy Guy will fly down. Eat him or shoot him to break
open the "?" Cloud he carriers, which contains stars. Go back down the stairs
and stay on the ground. Shoot the lower Piranha Plant, then go into the pipe
behind it. You're now underground. In this cave are 2 Flying Shy Guys carrying
Red Coins, a Star Tulip, and six Red Coins in the line of Coins above. There's
also a couple balloons, one carrying coins and another a 1-Up. Use the Chomp
Rock to collect the coins above and to reach the exit. When you come out of the
cave, go to the left to collect the third Flower. Head over to the right where
a Rotating Platform is. Jump down below it and collect the four Red Coins and
Flower there (you don't need to kill the Piranha Plants). Jump back out and
continue down the path. Shoot the cloud above the Shy Guy Pipe to release the
stars within. Further down the path is another "?" Cloud which contains a seed.
Shoot it and climb the Flower. Go over to the left and shoot the "?" Cloud in
the air. In it is a Flower. Grab it and jump onto the Rotating Platform. Above
it are the final two Red Coins. Jump to the ledge on the right and push the
Chomp Rock down the slope to clear the path of enemies. When it stops, look
upward to find a cloud which contains stars. Collect them, then head to the
exit.

~LEVEL 1-2: WATCH OUT BELOW!~
Type: Normal          Difficulty: Easy          Yoshi Color: Dark Red
No. of Coins: 96      No. of Stars: 25          No. of "?" Clouds: 5
Enemies: Shy Guy, Singing Flower, Piranha Plant, Flying Shy Guy, Chomp
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Helicopter

-Level Walkthrough-
The second level starts out in a field, much like the first. However, things
will soon get hectic as the Chomps in the background will have fun with target
practice... and you're the target! Watch for shadows and don't dawdle in any
place for too long. The first Flower is down the path a ways, right after the
pair of Shy Guys and right before where the first Chomp comes crashing down.
Right after the Flower are a few coins, two of which are Red Coins. Further
through the field is a "?" Cloud. Don't stand underneath it, because this is
where a Chomp drops. Shoot it to uncover a Flower. To the right of this area
four more Red Coins in the plain where quite a few Chomps drop. When you reach
the two posts, you're safe from Chomps, and even better, a Star Cloud is above.
Continue through the Blocker and activate the Middle Ring. Above the Shy Guy
Pipe are four Red Coins. Shoot an egg to reach them, then shoot another egg
through the wall on the right to get to the Arrow Ball. Jump up and in the next
area, head right, up, left, up, and right (if you go left instead of the last
right you'll find a second Middle Ring). You'll soon come to a Helicopter
Bubble. Transform, the head to the right. Beneath the first floating island are
two Red Coins and a Flower. Go inside the second floating island from the
bottom to reach another Flower, then head up and to the right (follow the
arrows) into a tunnel that contains three Red Coins. It may take you a few
tries, but just concentrate on getting the items. When you've gotten them all,
hit the Yoshi block on the ground near the entrance to the latter tunnel. Head
over to the pipe, but before entering, jump up above it to find two more Red
Coins. The next area starts off with a "?" Cloud, which contains a Flower. The
last three Red Coins are above the level's only Piranha Plant. Head to the
exit, and watch out for Chomps!

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *A Star Cloud is situated between the two posts after the Chomp Zone.
 *The Middle Ring after the Blocker will get you 10 more stars.
 *There's a second Middle Ring in the top-left corner of the tunnel
  maze.
~Red Coins:
 *Two Red Coins are in the first line of coins (in the Chomp Zone).
 *Four more Red Coins are in the second line of coins (in the Chomp
  Zone.
 *Four Red Coins are above the Shy Guy Pipe (after the first Middle
  Ring). Shoot an egg up to get them.
 *Two Red Coins are under the first floating island in the Helicopter
  Zone.
 *Three Red Coins are in a tunnel at the top-right corner of the
  Helicopter Zone.
 *Two Red Coins are above the pipe exiting the Helicopter Zone.
 *Three Red Coins are above the level's only Piranha Plant.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is in plain sight after the pair of Shy Guys.
 *The second Flower is hidden in a "?" Cloud in the center of the Chomp
  Zone.
 *The third Flower is under the first floating island in the Helicopter
  Zone.
 *The fourth Flower is in the second floating island. Enter from
  underneath.
 *The fifth Flower is in a "?" Cloud immediately after you exit the
  Helicopter Zone.

-1-Up Locations-
 *Run along the very bottom of the Helicopter Zone. At the very right is
  a Hidden Cloud which contains a 1-Up.
 *A Flying Shy Guy near the fifth Flower zooms down holding a 1-Up. Grab
  him to get it.

~LEVEL 1-3: THE CAVE OF THE CHOMP ROCK~
Type: Underground     Difficulty: Easy          Yoshi Color: Blue
No. of Coins: 122     No. of Stars: 26          No. of "?" Clouds: 4
Enemies: Piranha Plant, Shy Guy, Nipper, Lantern Ghoul
Mini-Games: Throwing Balloons (4)
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
As a nice change of pace, this level goes underground into a deep, dark cave
full of surprises. Go down the pipe at the beginning of the level to enter.
You'll come into a cave, and a Chomp Rock will start rolling behind you. Head
to the right (don't worry about the Chomp Rock. It won't hurt you). After the
first post is an easily-visible crate. Smash it to get six stars. Over to the
right some more is a second post surrounded by dirt. Do the Pound move to get
rid of the dirt, then pound down the post to find a Red Coin. Continue on and
you'll come to a small pit with Nippers inside. Above in the coin-filled-sky
are four Red Coins. Soon afterwards you'll enter an area with several tunnels
leading further underground. At the bottom of the leftmost tunnel is a Flower
and two Red Coins. The second tunnel turns branches into three tunnels.
Starting at 12 and going counter-clockwise, the first tunnel leads to the Key
Hut, the second leads to a Flower and two Red Coins, and the third leads to
four Red Coins and a Star Cloud. Collect all the items, then go above this
tunnel to find the Middle Ring. Over to the right more is a prime
mushroom-growing area. Above the mushrooms is another Flower. Over more to the
right are several tall posts, and those who pound them will find two Red Coins.
Above these posts are two items floating by on balloons: a crate (filled with
stars) and a key (to the Key Hut). Shoot them both down with eggs, then head
back to the Key Hut to play the nice Mini-Game, Throwing Balloons. When all is
done, head back past the posts and through the tunnels (two Red Coins are
before the enemy pipe). On the right part of the dirt area is a Flower. Shoot
through the dirt to get it. Further down the path are two posts. Pound the left
one down to unveil a Hidden cloud. Shoot it to make a Switch appear, and stomp
it to find out where to go. Take the warp to a coin-filled Bonus Area. After
you exit, push the Chomp Rock down the path so you can jump on it and reach the
area above, which has three Red Coins and the final Flower. Now all you have to
do is get out of the cave and to the end of the level, which isn't much further
now.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *The crate at the level's beginning contains six stars.
 *A Star Cloud rests at the bottom of the rightmost tunnel.
 *Another crate flies up in the sky attached to balloons after the
  tunnel area. Shoot the balloons with eggs to make it come to earth.
 *Don't miss the Middle Ring above the right tunnels.
~Red Coins:
 *A Red Coin is hidden in the second post in the level (the one
  surrounded by dirt).
 *Four Red Coins are found in the air after the second post (above the
  pit full of Nipper Plants).
 *Two Red Coins are found at the bottom of the leftmost tunnel.
 *Two Red Coins are found at the bottom of the left branch of the
  right tunnel.
 *Four Red Coins are found at the bottom of the right branch of the
  right tunnel.
 *Two Red Coins are in the group of three posts where the Nipper spores
  land.
 *Two Red Coins are found after the ones previously mentioned, before
  the Lantern Ghoul pipe.
 *Three Red Coins are found in the chamber above the second Chomp Rock
  (push the Chomp Rock over to the opening and use it as a step).
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is at the end of the righmost tunnel.
 *The second Flower is at the end of the left branch of the right
  tunnel.
 *The third Flower is found above the mushrooms after the tunnel area.
 *The fourth Flower can be found in the right section of the dirt.
 *Look for the final Flower in the chamber above the tunnel before the
  exit, which can be reached by jumping from on top of the Chomp Rock.

-1-Up Locations-
 *At the very beginning of the level, shoot the Piranha Plant on the
  right. Jump over to where it was, and a Hidden Cloud will appear.
  Shoot it to receive a 1-Up.
 *In the dirt area, shoot the upper left portion of the large patch of
  dirt of the right. You may hit (or reveal) a cloud behind the dirt,
  which contains a 1-Up.

~LEVEL 1-4: BURT THE BASHFUL'S FORT~
Type: Castle          Difficulty: Medium Easy   Yoshi Color: Yellow
No. of Coins: 169     No. of Stars: 30          No. of "?" Clouds: 3
Enemies: Bouncing Burt, Falling Wall, Spiked Ball & Chain, Small Lava
         Flame, Lava-enut, Mini Lava-enut
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
This is the first time you'll face a boss, but don't worry, he's not that hard.
This level is filled with traps and deadly lava, so watch your step. Start by
running down the long hallway (watch out for falling walls), and be sure to
pick up the Yellow Eggs along the way. When you get to the Small Arrow Ball,
jump up above, then drop down into the room below (with the pair of Bouncing
Burts). Grab the Flower on the other side, then jump back up. Continue and drop
through the Blockers, then grab the Flower to the left. Now head across the
lava pit. The six coins surrounding the large island where the Falling Wall is
are all Red Coins, and you can find another above one of the platforms.
Activate the Middle Ring before the pipe, then enter it. In here, run by the
Spiked Ball & Chains (don't miss the Star Cloud, though) and shoot the "?"
Cloud above the lava to make a bridge appear. Run across, collecting the three
Red Coins there along the way. Jump onto the See-Saw on the other end and
collect the Flower that's barely above the lava and the one that's high above
in the air (on the left). Collect the two Red Coins above it, too. After the
See-Saw is a Rotating Platform to either side of it are Red Coins (don't worry
about the Mini Lava-enut beneath it, he's too slow to be able to hurt you).
Head over to the right, past the Shy Guy pipe and the Locked Door. Wait by the
lava lake for the Lava-enut to rise, then shoot it. This will give you enough
time to get across. Hop over it, but don't miss the six Red Coins that are in
the air. On the other side, push the Flower Pot off the ledge to find the Key.
Run back across the lava lake (shoot the Lava-enut again if it's needed) and
use the Key on the Locked Door. You'll now be in the final hallway. In the
first door are four Piranha Plants. Kill them all to receive Flower. At the end
of the hallway is a Middle Ring, a Star Cloud, and a red door that leads to the
boss.

-BOSS: Burt the Bashful-
Burt the bashful, like all of the bosses, is a giant-sized version if the
common enemy (thanks to Kamek's magic). Burt is embarrassed quite easily, and
that's his weakness. He'd be incredibly embarrassed if his pants fell down, so
he always keeps them up to his neck. So, as strange (and sick) as it may sound,
Yoshi has to get off Burt's pants. This is rather easy. Just shoot eggs at him,
and his pants will slowly lower. duck down in the little pits to avoid being
hurt, and collect eggs from the Egg Flower. It's best to run under him at the
start so you can duck in the pit that's close to the Egg Flower. After a six
shots with eggs, Burt will be destroyed.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *A Middle Ring awaits at the end of the first lava area.
 *A Star Cloud awaits above one of the Spiked Ball & Chains after you
  take the pipe to the second part of the level.
 *Right before Burt the Bashful is another Middle Ring.
 *There's also a Star Cloud right above the previously mentioned Middle
  Ring.
~Red Coins:
 *Six Red Coins await on either side of the Falling Wall Island in the
  middle of the first lava lake.
 *A Red Coin can be found above the first lava lake.
 *Three Red Coins are above the Outline Bridge.
 *Two Red Coins rest above the See-Saw.
 *Two Red Coins can be collected if you ride the Rotating Platform after
  the See-Saw.
 *The final six Red Coins float above the Lava-enut's lava area.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is guarded by two Bouncing Burts after the first
  Arrow Ball.
 *The second Flower can be located right after the first, underneath the
  level's only Blockers.
 *Flower three is on the right end of the See-Saw, barely above the
  lava.
 *The fourth Flower is on the left end of the See-Saw, high above in the
  air.
 *Find the fifth Flower in the Piranha Plant room that's connected to
  the hallway leading to Burt. Kill all of the Piranha Plants inside to
  get it.

-Hidden Stuff-
 *In the first area, look at the ceiling after the first Arrow Ball.
  Every once in a while you'll see a cracked block. Shoot it with an egg
  to make it crumble. Now, jump up and run along the top of the ceiling.
  Although you can't see what's going on, there's a long line of coins
  up there. Run both ways (you can jump over any more blocks you run
  into) to collect a couple of 1-Ups worth of coins.

~LEVEL 1-5: HOP! HOP! DONUT LIFTS!~
Type: Sky             Difficulty: Medium Easy   Yoshi Color: Purple
No. of Coins: 57      No. of Stars: 25          No. of "?" Clouds: 3
Enemies: Flowerbed Shy Guy, Flying Shy Guy, Singing Flower, Shy Guy
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is a bit trickier than the previous few, mainly because it's
self-scrolling and there's a couple tricky jumps involved (if you want to get
all the items). Follow the screen along until you come to a rotating platform.
The coins on either side above the lowest coins are Red. Scoop them up, then
jump over to the platform on the left. Wait for it (be patient) to go down and
get the Flower. Another Rotating Platform to the left has two Red Coins
positioned at the very bottom of the semi-circle of coins. After this area,
there's a self-rotating platform. Get on it and start moving it over to the
left. Along the way you'll collect two Red Coins, and a Flower awaits at the
end. When it stops, jump up to the platform above and grab the Red Coin from
the Flying Shy Guy. On down the path more is a Star Cloud, then the level
begins to scroll upwards. Don't fall behind or you'll die. A Flower is above
the red platform in the middle of the first ascent, and soon after is the
level's Middle Ring. To the right of the Middle Ring is a Self-Rotating
Platform. Go across the chasm, and collect the five Red Coins and the Flower
along the path. The level will continue to scroll upward, and you'll come
across two cross-shaped coin formations along the way. The center coin in both
is a Red Coin. In the middle of this second ascent, Flying Shy Guy will zoom
down with a Star Cloud. Grab it before he flies away. At the top of the ascent
is another Star Cloud. Now the level will begin to scroll to the right. A
Flying Shy Guy carries a Red Coin, but then you'll be forced onto Donut Lifts.
Hop so they don't fall, and shoot the Flower enclosed in the dirt with an egg.
Under the last row of Donut Lifts are five Red Coins. Let the Donut Lifts drop,
then jump off after you collect the coins. The end of the level is right ahead.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *There's a Star Cloud right before the ascent, above some Donut Lifts.
 *The Middle Ring is at the middle of the ascent (to the left).
 *On the second half of the ascent, a wily Flying Shy Guy will drop down
  with a Star Cloud in his paws. Grab it before he flies away.
 *At the top of the ascent is a final Star Cloud.
 *Behind the Goal Ring, you'll find a Hidden Star Cloud.
~Red Coins:
 *There's two Red Coins on the first Rotating Platform, at 9:00 and 3:00
  (if it were a clock).
 *There's two more Red Coins on the second Rotating Platform, at 4:00
  and 8:00 (if it were a clock).
 *A Flying Shy Guy above the first Self-Rotating Platform carries a Red
  Coin.
 *Ride the Self-Rotating Platform and you'll get two Red Coins along the
  way.
 *Ride the second Self-Rotating platform and you'll get five Red Coins
  along the way.
 *On the second half of the ascent, look for two cross-shaped coin
  formations. In the center of each one is a Red Coin.
 *At the top of the ascent and a little to the right is a Flying Shy Guy
  that carries a Red Coin.
 *Below the final Donut Lifts are five Red Coins. Let the Donut Lifts
  fall and you can grab them (do two at once).
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is between the first two Rotating Platforms. Wait for
  the moving Platform to move onto it, or shoot an egg at it.
 *The second Flower is found at the end of the first Rotating Platform's
  path.
 *The third Flower is on the first half of the ascent, in plain view
  (it's next to the red platform).
 *Look for the fourth Flower at the end of the second Rotating
  Platform's path.
 *The last Flower is surrounded by dirt at the end of the level (above
  the Donut Lifts). Shoot an egg to get it.

~LEVEL 1-6: SHY GUYS ON STILTS~
Type: Normal/Underground   Difficulty: Easy       Yoshi Color: Brown
No. of Coins: 55           No. of Stars: 28       No. of "?" Clouds: 6
Enemies: Stilt Shy Guy, Shy Guy, Lantern Ghoul, Piranha Plant, Cave Bat
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Mole Tank

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is another pretty standard level. Start by moving over to the left,
where a huge mountain will block your path. Use the Large Arrow Ball to spring
up to the door on the cloud. Inside, pick up the eggs, and shoot the Flashing
one at one of the Shy Guys to release the coin within (it's best to do this
now). Now go back outside and go into the pipe. You'll tumble down into a cave.
Make your way to where the Lantern Ghoul pipe is, then look up to find a Large
Arrow Ball being held up by a balloon. Shoot it down, then bounce up. In the
long line of coins are four Red Coins. Instead of reaching the ledge, fall down
near the wall to drop onto a Flower. Bounce back up and take the yellow
platform out of the cave. Don't jump off when you emerge. Ride it up to the
top, where three Red Coins wait. Now you can jump down, where a Middle Ring,
Star Cloud, and several Stilt Shy Guys are located. A little ways down is a
tulip flower, and a post. Defeat the Stilt Shy Guys first, then pound down the
post. Follow the coins to a Flower and a Red Coin. Over the next hill is a pit.
Destroy the Piranha Plant on the left, then grab the two Red Coins and the
Flower in between the posts (pound them down). Now, shoot the "?" Cloud above,
and a Switch will drop. Activate it, then warp into the hidden area on the
right side of the pit. Inside is another "?" Cloud. Shoot it to reveal to Mole
Tank transformation. Use this to dig through the dirt. The leftmost and
rightmost coins on the top are Red Coins, but your main priority should be
reaching the Yoshi block. You can always collect the coins with eggs later. Use
the pipe to go back up when you're done. To the right of the pit, jump on top
of the face block, and jump into the air to reach the fourth Flower. Now
continue down the path and into the cave. In here, use the red platform to
rocket to the top of the mushroom area. Up here, aim an egg at the line of
coins to make a couple bank shots and get the Flower and six Red Coins up
there. Jump back down and head over to the right. Hit the "?" Cloud to make the
seed drop. There's two Red Coins above the flower. Bounce on the Large Arrow
Ball to go outside. A final "?" Cloud out there contains five more stars. It's
just a few steps away from the finish now.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *After you exit the first cave, a little ways down the path is the
  Middle Ring.
 *Right next to the Middle Ring is a Star Cloud.
 *A little ways past the Middle Ring is a Star Tulip.
 *After exiting the second cave, a Star Cloud is right above.
~Red Coins
 *Shoot the Flashing Egg found in the cloud door (bounce up from the
  Large Arrow Ball at the level's beginning) at an enemy to get a Red
  Coin.
 *In the first cave, the line of coins that you follow while bouncing
  off the Large Arrow Ball contains four Red Coins.
 *After exiting the first cave, stay of the Guided Platform and at the
  end of the path are three Red Coins.
 *One Red Coin resides next to the level's third Flower, which is under
  the first post.
 *In the pit with the Piranha Plant are two Red Coins.
 *In the Mole Tank area (shoot the "?" Cloud above the pit and trip the
  switch), collect the coins on the top right and top left. You may want
  to get to the Yoshi block first and then get them with eggs, but you
  have plenty of time.
 *In the final cave, go to the top (via the red platform) and shoot an
  egg at the line of coins to get five Red Coins.
 *At the far right of the second cave is a grouping of coins, two of
  which are Red Coins.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is found on the right side of the first cave. Bounce
  off either the Large or the Small Arrow Ball there to reach it.
 *The second Flower is after the exit to the first cave. Pound the post
  underneath the Star Tulip, then run to the right to find the Flower.
 *The third Flower is in the pit after the second. Pound down the posts
  to reach it.
 *After the pit, jump on the Face Block to reach the fourth Flower
  sitting high in the air (or use an egg).
 *The last Flower is at the top of the second cave (reach it by riding
  the red platform). Use bank shots off the walls to get it (aim at the
  line of coins).

-1-Up Locations-
 *At the beginning of the level, use the Large Arrow Ball to reach the
  top of the mountain. Over to the left is a Hidden Cloud, which
  contains a 1-Up.
 *A 1-Up balloon rests after the Bonus Ring at the levels end. Eat it to
  receive the 1-Up.

~LEVEL 1-7: TOUCH FUZZY, GET DIZZY~
Type: Normal/Forest   Difficulty: Easy          Yoshi Color: Red
No. of Coins: 79      No. of Stars: 25          No. of "?" Clouds: 5
Enemies: Fuzzy, Rolly Bug, Tap-Tap, Red-Nosed Tap-Tap, Piranha Plant,
         Big Flower, Flowerbed Shy Guy, Mini Milde, Singing Flower
Mini-Games: Gather Coins
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Rolly Bug Area ---> Dirt Area ---> Fuzzy Area ---> Bridge Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level introduces some of the more bizarre characters in Yoshi's Island,
but still isn't that tough to finish. The first Flower is easily visible
between two logs near the start of the level. The easiest way to get it is to
spit one of nearby Rolly Bugs into it. Continue down the path, and use a Rolly
Bug to destroy the line of Tap-Taps marching up the hill. Soon you'll come to
an area filled with yellowish dirt, and a Mini-Game Hut. Right above the Hut is
a Flower, surrounded by dirt. Sure, you can waste eggs, but why not use the
Watermelon that's hanging on a nearby vine to shred through the dirt? Collect
the Flower and pick up the Flashing eggs to either side of it (the best enemy
to use them on are the Tap-Taps a little further down the path). Shoot the dirt
above the Flower, and you'll uncover a "?" Cloud which contains the Key to the
Hut. Enter and play the Gather Coins Mini-Game. Exit the Hut and continue on.
In the dirt past the Tap-Taps are two Red Coins. After the coins and the Shy
Guy pipe is the Middle Ring. Stock up on eggs, then jump down the opening in
the ground (collect the Flower) and enter the Fuzzy area. Try not to hit any
Fuzzies, as you'll get very dizzy. While this probably won't mean doom in this
stage, it is annoying and may prevent you from getting items for a while.
There's a Green Egg Block up ahead, so don't be stingy with the eggs. At the
beginning of the Fuzzy area are three Red Coins. In the middle of this area is
a small pit with a Flower in it. Right past it is a Piranha Plant with two Red
Coins above it. Also in the middle is a Star Cloud. Near the end of the Fuzzy
area is a long patch of coins, with a Flower above the center. Shoot an egg at
it to collect it. When the Fuzzies stop coming, you'll see an island with two
Mini Mildes on it. After it is a Star Cloud. Enter the next area, where some
sagging bridges will let you collect two Red Coins (both before and after the
log in the center). To get the three Red Coins under the log, pound the bridge
and it'll collapse. To find the last few Red Coins, stand on top of the log.
Get out an egg and aim straight up, then fire. A Small Arrow Ball will fall
down. Use it to bounce up to a hidden area. Up here, go to the left. There's a
Chomp Rock here, but it's right up a against the wall. Stand on the very right
edge of the Rock, and it'll begin to slowly move. Once it's away from the wall,
get on the other side and push. Soon it'll activate a Hidden Cloud. Shoot it
for a Growing Flower to grow. Climb up the leaves to the clouds above, where
four Red Coins and a Star Cloud wait. Jump back down and enter the pipe to exit
the hidden area, then head to the nearby exit.

-Item Locations-

-Castle Layout-

Roller Area ---> Sewer Area ---> Spike Platform Area --->
Arrow Globe Area ---> Boss

-Level Walkthrough-
The first area is filled with Red Coins, so grab any that you can see. There's
two above the first Roller, two under the Self Rotating Platform's starting
position, two above the second Roller, six above the third Roller, and finally
one last one high above the third Roller (jump up near the wall). Right to the
left of the last coin mentioned is a Flower, too. Now enter the pipe at the end
of this area and enter the sewer area. Jump on the Ghost Platform in the center
as soon as you can, and grab the Flower at the very top center. Then leap over
to the left and go into the room, where another Flower awaits. Finally, flutter
jump over to the other side and enter the room to fins two Red Coins, a Middle
Ring, and a Star Cloud. Now go back into the sewer area and enter the pipe on
the bottom left. Now you're in the Spike Platform area. Run over to the very
right to get the fourth Flower. Head back to the green Spike Platform and use
it reach the path above (there's a Star Cloud here). Go to the very top of the
room, and hit the red Platform Switch. Now jump to the bottom, and use the
now-turned-over red Spike Platform (which has three Red Coins above it, by the
way) to get to the Rotating Platforms. Above it is a pot. Push it off the ledge
to get the key inside. Jump out of the top of this enclosed area and head to
the right. On top is the last Flower, while under it is a door that leads to
the next area. Run across the Spike platforms to collect two Red Coins and
reach the door. Inside, use the Arrow Globe to get to the top of the room.
Activate the Middle Ring, then enter the Boss door.

Salvo the Slime is harmless. In fact, he can't hurt you at all. Only his little
slime buddies can (and the lava at the end of the arena). Shoot an egg through
his slimy body to knock part of it off. Some of those little parts will turn
into Slimes, which you can eat to get more eggs. Keep shooting eggs at him and
eventually he'll be so small that he'll disappear. Victory!

~EXTRA 1: POOCHY AIN'T STUPID~
Type: Underground     Difficulty: Hard          Yoshi Color: Green
No. of Coins: 21      No. of Stars: 40          No. of "?" Clouds: 8
Enemies: Bullet Bill, Cave Bats, Spiked Ball & Chain, Tap-Taps
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
Trust me, you'll be thinking the exact opposite of what this level's called
once you've played it. This is one of the most difficult levels in the game.
It's a self-scrolling lava world, and the only way to get past the fields of
magma is to ride the reckless Poochy. If you want to complete this level, you'd
better get used to controlling Poochy. Tap the direction you want to go in, and
if you don't want to go fast (this is common in a self-scrolling level like
this), just tap the opposite direction, and keep switching to stay in
relatively the same place. OK, now onto the level. Shoot the Star Cloud at the
beginning, then head over to the end of the screen to get the level to start
scrolling. Along the opening stretch are a bunch of Cave Bats, which can be
easily eaten for eggs. After you cross the first field of lava, you'll see
another Star Cloud. Not far after another Star Cloud will come into view (if
you think this is a lot, this is just the beginning of this level's Star
Clouds). Right after the third Star Cloud is the first Flower, and then you'll
reach a hill. On the way up, there's a Star Cloud, and on the way down is a
Flower in a pit. Have Poochy jump down into it to get it, or fire an egg. At
the end of the hill is a drop off and a Bullet Bill cannon. Stomp the incoming
Bullet Bill and use the momentum to jump above it (follow the row of coins, why
includes six Red Coins), where a - guess what? - Star Cloud awaits. Continue to
follow the line of coins and you'll run into a Flower. During this leap
downwards, you must use the flutter jump to give Poochy time to find your
position (so you can land on him). Next is another hill, and a bunch of bats
will fly by to replenish your egg supply. Above the hill is a Star Cloud, and
on the way down there's two Red coins in a pit of lava (use Poochy or eggs to
get them). At the end of the hilly area is another Flower. Next is the tough
part. A Spiked Ball & Chain spins right above the lava, and you not only have
to get under it, but get under it when the screen scrolls far enough so you can
get out of the way. If you duck, you can avoid the spikes in most places. Under
the SB&C itself are three Red Coins, and right past it four Red Coins, a
Flower, and two Star Clouds. The final part of the level is a drop down to the
goal. Jump off Poochy and follow the line of coins (all five are Red Coins) to
it.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *Star Clouds galore! They're everywhere in this level, and all easily
  visible. Any "?" Cloud you see is a Star Cloud. To reach the 30 star
  target, get the Star Cloud at the level's opening, the one after the
  first lava field, the one on the hill, and the one above the Bullet
  Bill cannon. There's also one on the Cave Bat hill, and two after the
  Spiked Ball & Chain at the level's end.
~Red Coins:
 *There's six Red Coins in the line of coins above the Bullet Bill
  cannon. Bounce off Bill's head to reach them.
 *On the Cave Bat hill, there's a small pit in which two Red Coins lie.
  Ride Poochy into it or shoot an egg to get them.
 *Under the Spiked Ball & Chain are three Red Coins.
 *After the Spiked Ball & Chain are four Red Coins.
 *At the end of the level is a row of five Red Coins leading to the exit.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is found after the third Star Cloud, above the lava.
 *The second Flower is on the other side of the first hill, in a small
  pit. Ride Poochy or shoot an egg to get it.
 *The third Flower is at the end of the line of coins above the Bullet
  Bill cannon. Bounce off the Bullet Bill to jump over the rock
  formation.
 *The fourth Flower is at the end of the hilly, Cave Bat area.
 *The last Flower can be found after the Spiked Ball & Chain, right in
  the air. Shoot an egg if you're too scared to risk jumping.

~LEVEL 2-1: VISIT KOOPA AND PARA-KOOPA~
Type: Normal          Difficulty: Easy          Yoshi Color: Green

Enemies: Koopa, Para-Koopa, Tap-Tap, Big Flower, Flying Shy Guy, Shy Guy
Mini-Games: Popping Balloons
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Koopa Area ---> Poochy Area ---> Crushing Block Area --->
Flower Area ---> Balloon Area ---> Falling Block Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
The level begins in a area filled with Koopas and Falling Blocks above a
bottomless pit. Keep moving until you see a pipe on the right side of one of
the islands. Go down, and grab the Super Mario Star inside to transform into...
da da dah daaah!... SUPER BABY MARIO!!! Run up the wall and into the room with
a bunch of coins. At the bottom is another star. Replenish your powers with it,
the run up along the right wall. Keep running, over the coins (unless you want
to collect a few) and past the star, then drop down into the opening. Keep
running, and at the end of the path is a Flower. After you get it, warp back up
the pipe. Above it and to the right a little bit is another Flower. Stand on
the tall Falling Block to get it. Keep going left, and collect the four Red
Coins above the Falling Blocks, then stand on the last Block to fall into the
two Red Coins below it. Warp down the pipe ahead to enter the Poochy Area.
Inside, jump on Poochy and tap right to speed across the field and over the
spikes. When you get to the tall mound, let Poochy jump, then jump off of him
to clear it. On the other side are four Red Coins and a Crate containing a Key.
Head back and warp up the second pipe. Go through the Middle Ring and then
bounce off the Large Arrow Ball. You'll now be in the Crushing Block area,
where a bunch of Falling Blocks will fall down to the earth. Don't get stuck
under them, or you'll die. At the top is a Flower, which you should grab before
a final Falling Block covers it. Head over to the right, and stand on one of
the gray blocks to either side of the Big Flower. As it falls, eat or shoot the
Flying shy Guys to collect the four Red Coins they have. If you miss any, you
can always go back up and try again. When you've got them all, head down to the
right where a bunch of balloons will float overhead. Two crates are among the
carried objects, each containing six stars. When the balloons stop, quickly
head over to the right and grab the Flower near the wall, then get out of the
way of the Falling Blocks above. Use them to climb to the top of the wall,
where you'll see more Falling Blocks. Jump across them in the air, and if they
haven't fallen too far, you can reach the final Flower above. Right to the
right of it is a Hidden Cloud containing five Stars. Drop down through the
Blockers, then run across the Falling Blocks, collecting the six Red Coins
strewn about. The exit is just ahead, and the Mini-Game hut (which you can play
Popping Balloons in) is right before it.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *A Middle Ring is found right after you leave the Poochy area.
 *Two crates (containing six stars each) float above the ground in the
  balloon area.
 *A Star Cloud is found right to the right of the last Flower (a Hidden
  Cloud).
~Red Coins:
 *Six Red Coins are near the end of the Koopa area (where you start
  out), four above the Falling Blocks (get them before they fall) and
  two are below (grab them when the block falls).
 *Four Red Coins are at the very right end of the Poochy area. Ride
  Poochy to get them.
 *Four Red Coins are carried by Flying Shy Guys that float beneath the
  first Big Flower. Stand on one of the Falling Blocks to drop by them.
 *Six Red Coins are along the final long set of Falling Blocks.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is found inside the first pipe (in the middle of the
  Koopa area). Grab the Super Mario Star inside and continue going right
  (you'll eventually turn around), and just follow the path to the
  Flower.
 *Flower two is right after the first pipe, above a tall Falling Block.
 *The third Flower is on the top of the Crushing Block area. Grab it
  quickly when you reach the top or a final Falling Block will cover it
  up.
 *The fourth Flower is to the right of the Balloon area, against a wall.
  Grab it before the Falling Blocks above cover it up.
 *The final Flower can be reached by jumping across the Falling Blocks
  high in the air. Go fast and you can reach it.

-1-Up Locations-
 *Right after the second Flower you'll see a "?" Cloud under a block. To
  get it, slurp up a Koopa and spit it out onto the block before it. The
  shell should hit it.
 *Right at the end of the Balloon area, a Flying Shy Guy will float down
  for a couple seconds. Grab the 1-Up he carries before he flies away.

-Level Layout-

Starting Area (Field Area) ---> Super Baby Mario Area --->
Baseball Boy Clouds Area ---> Cave Maze 1 ---> Cave Maze 2 ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
The Baseball Boys are unique enemies, and you'll get to meet them for the first
time in this level, as well as Cactus Plants and Cave Mice. Head down the
tunnel at the beginning, and fire at the "?" Cloud. The barrier in front of you
will move down, and right on the other side is the first Flower. Further down
the path are four Cactus Plants. Above the first one are two Red Coins, and two
more Red Coins float above the second. Burst open the cloud above the third to
get a 1-Up. Nothing is over the last one. At the end of the path is a Shy Guy
pipe and a "?" Cloud. Stock up on eggs and shoot the cloud to make a Growing
Flower grow. Climb up and head to the right and up the chamber. At the very top
are two Flying Shy Guys with Red Coins. Jump down the opening to the right,
then head down the stairs (there are two Red Coins on the way down). Drop off
the end and shoot the Arrow Cloud to get the  Super Mario Star out of its
prison. Collect it, then follow the arrows and over the spikes that were
impassable before. Right after the spikes is a Middle Ring. In the "?" Cloud
behind the first Pitcher is a Flower. Destroy the Pitcher with three stomps or
any remaining Super Baby Mario power, then collect the prize. Above the second
Pitcher are two Red Coins. At the end, there's three coins above deadly spikes,
which require some slick thinking to get. Toss an egg at the Pitcher on the
spikes, then jump and dash over to behind him. When he throws, he'll throw the
egg right through the coins, collecting the Red Coin there. In this next area,
bounce up to the ledge on the Large Arrow Ball. On the very bottom left is a
Middle Ring. Climb up on top of and through the insides of the square
formations to reach the top. Inside a few of the formations are a Red Coin, a
Star Cloud, and a flower. Search around to find them. To help you get to some
(and the exit), bounce on the Large Arrow Ball on the middle left (above the
Middle ring's cave). Now you'll enter the first Cave Maze. At the first branch,
head upward to find a Red Coin. Head back and go down. At the next branch, go
left to find a Flower. Take the last route to exit the cave. Soon you'll come
to the second Cave Maze. at the beginning is a "?" Cloud. Shoot it to reveal a
Mole Tank transformation. Tunnel through the dirt to find three Red coins. Now
you'll come to the maze. Head to the right first. For this path head to the
right at every branch. On the first branch, go to the end to find a Red Coin,
and do the same for the next branch down. The third branch down, go right and
you will find a 1-Up. Head left to find a Red Coin in between two Tap-Taps,
then head back up to the top and take the left path. For this side, head to the
left at every branch to find an item, then go down. The first left branch will
lead to a Crate, the second will lead to nothing, the third to a Red coin, and
the last a Star Cloud. Head right on the final branch to enter a large room
with a Star Tulip in the center. Spit the nearby Shy Guy into it to reap the
rewards. Then drop down below it. Outside,

 *One Red Coin can be found above the second Pitcher in the Baseball Boy
  Cloud area.
 *At the end of the Baseball Boy Cloud area is a Pitcher standing on

  over the mound and behind him. When he throws, he'll hit the cloud,
  getting you a 1-Up.
 *In the area which the second middle ring is in, search inside the
  floating formations to find a Red Coin (it's in the middle-left part).
 *Find one Red Coin in the Cave Maze 1 by going up at the first branch.
 *At the beginning of the Cave Maze 2, burst open the "?" Cloud and use
  the Mole Tank transformation to collect the three Red Coins in the
  dirt.
 *In the Cave Maze 2, there are Red Coins (one each) at the end of the
  following paths: right, right; right, down, right; left, down, down,
  left, and right, down, down, left.
 *Below the Star Tulip at the end of the Cave Maze 2 is a row of coins

 *Above the third Cactus Plant is a "?" Cloud containing a 1-Up.
 *At the end of the Baseball Boy Cloud area is a Pitcher standing on
  Spikes, with a "?" Cloud behind him. Throw an egg at him, then leap

~LEVEL 2-3: WHAT'S GUSTY TASTE LIKE?~
Type: Underground/Forest  Difficulty: Medium Easy  Yoshi Color: Blue
No. of Coins: 107         No. of Stars: 35         No. of "?" Clouds: 9
Enemies: Gusty, Shy Guy, Flying Shy Guy, Lantern Ghoul, Cave Bat,
         Nep-enut, Land Goonies
Mini-Games: Throwing Balloons
Transformations: Mole Tank

-Level Layout-

Gusty Area ---> Dirt Area ---> Cave Area ---> Chomp Rock Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level starts off in a lush Forest, then takes the underworld of Cave Bats,
Lantern Ghouls, and Mole Tanks. The first thing of interest is a Red Coin found
after the group of outline coins. A little ways down the path is a Flower above
the first pit. After this is a Star Cloud, above the smallish hill. The last
coin in the following row is a Red Coin. Continue to find a "?" Cloud in a pit.
Shoot it to uncover a Flower. After the Flower is a line of coins, one of which
is a Red Coin (above this is a Star Cloud). Now, warp down the pipe and enter
the Dirt area. The level's Middle Ring awaits in here, as well as a Lantern
Ghoul pipe. Maximize your egg count, then start your way through the dirt (by
shooting eggs to clear it). After the first wall of dirt are two Red Coins.
Near the end of the dirt area are a bunch of thin dirt walls. In between a
couple are two Red Coins. At the end of the Dirt area, Cave Bats will begin to
swoop down. Replenish your egg supply, and destroy the large section of dirt
(behind the left side of the dirt is a Star Cloud). Head out into the Cave
area, and down the "steps". Above the steps is a Flying Shy Guy carrying a Red
Coin. There's also one underneath the Flying Shy Guy. In the first cave are
three clouds. The first is a Star Cloud, the second makes a coin appear, and
the third contains a Flower. Jump down below to collect the Super Mario Star,
and run down the path, destroying the Bats and Land Goonies. In the line of
coins is a Red Coin. When the power wears off, go down and to the left. In this
massive dirt area, shoot an egg diagonally up to form a staircase. Climb up to
the top. In the middle of the top is a Flower. Also in this dirt area is a Star
Cloud (the lower middle area) and a "?" Cloud (the middle left area) containing
a Switch. Hit it, the enter the secret area to the left. Inside are ten Red
Coins guarded by an angry Nep-enut, so be sure to come prepared with eggs. Head
out of the big dirt area and to the left now. in the dirt near the Watermelons
is a Star Cloud. Cross the pit proceeding it and shoot the "?" Cloud to uncover
a Mole Tank. Head into the dirt area to the right and go towards the Yoshi
block above. When you transform back, grab the key. Head back up to where the
Super Mario Star power ended, and use the falling Chomp Rock to reach the
Mini-Game Hut (you will play Throwing Balloons). When you finish, head back
past where you picked up the key and shoot the dirt above to let the Large
Arrow Ball drop. To the left of where you bounce up is a Flower. Now, simply
head to the right, pound the dirt to get to the Chomp Rock, and start pushing
it. It'll protect you all the way to the end of the level.

 *Right after you change into Super Baby Mario, you'll come to a line
  of coins on the ground. One is a Red Coin.
 *In the large dirt area (after the Super Mario Star), clear out the

~LEVEL 2-4: BIGGER BOO'S FORT~
Type: Castle          Difficulty: Medium Easy   Yoshi Color: Yellow
No. of Coins: 66      No. of Stars: 31          No. of "?" Clouds: 5
Enemies: Boo Buddy, Boo, Ghost Blob, Ghost Shy Guy, Gusty, Fire Chain,
         Boo Chain, Boo Balloon, Blindfold Boo
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Lava Area ---> Staircase Area ---> Boo Area ---> Bigger Boo

-Level Walkthrough-
This level isn't very big, but getting through it will still take some time. In
the Lava area, bounce eggs off the walls to destroy the Boos and collect stars.
Above the first row of blocks that materialize when you hit the switch is a
Flower. At the end of the Lava area are four Red Coins in groups of two. Enter
the pipe to go to the Staircase area. In here, shoot the "?" Cloud furthest
right (as far as you can go) and enter the door that comes out of it. Inside,
defeat the two Boos and a Flower will appear. Head back out and shoot the "?"
Cloud to the left. A staircase will appear (also shoot an egg at the coins
beneath it to collect three Red Coins). Climb it and go to the left, where eggs
and a Star Cloud wait. Jump onto the yellow Guided platform above it, and
collect the coins along the path (two of which are Red Coins). At the end of
the path, jump into the upper path. Follow it down, then jump down the opening
and to the right. Trip the switch, then jump down and go to the right. Shoot an
egg at the line of coins to collect them and the Key inside the "?" Cloud. Now
head down to the left. Jump onto the yellow Guided Platform again, but this
time go into the locked door at the end of the route. Inside is a room filled
with Boos. Destroy them if you'd like. There are four Red Coins in the middle
of this room, three Red Coins in the top/middle portion, and a Flower in the
top/right portion. Head into the pipe in the top/left portion to exit. Smash
the crate blocking the path (collect the stars), then ride the yellow Guided
Platform one last time. This time, the stairs you created before are gone, and
you can jump into the middle path. At the start of the path is a Middle Ring,
as well as a Flower. Hit the switch and run across the bridge of blocks, then
go into the pipe at the end. Now you're in the Boo area. The first group of two
coins are Red Coins, as well as the third. In the middle of the room is a block
in the ceiling that's cracked. Break it apart with an egg, then jump into it
and head to the left. Fall down at the end and go into the door. Inside, shoot
one of the Balloon Boos three times to make a switch fall down. Stomp it and
jump up to the upper left part of the room to collect a Flower (this room will
also be filled with coins!). Leave the room and head to the end of the Boo
area. At the start of the next room is a Middle Ring. It's just a little ways
to the boss now.

-BOSS: Bigger Boo-
Bigger Boo doesn't look too intimidating at first, but soon he'll grow into a
gigantic foe that'll take up nearly half of the room. Fortunately, Bigger Boo
suffers from the fear that all Boos have, and will turn transparent when you
face him. Eat the Bats that fly by to make eggs, then turn away from Bigger
Boo, wait for him to materialize, then bounce an egg off the wall and hit him.
Five hits will destroy him.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *There's a Star Cloud to the left of the stairs in the "?" Cloud.
 *After the chamber filled with Boos (in the Locked Door), you'll fall
  down next to a crate containing Stars.
 *A Middle Ring waits in the middle path of the Stair area.
 *A Middle Ring is right inside the door leaving the Boo area.
~Red Coins:
 *Four Red Coins are at the end of the Lava area.
 *Three Red Coins rest underneath he first staircase. Shoot an egg up
   to get them.
 *Two Red Coins are above the yellow Guided Platforms path.
 *Seven Red Coins wait inside the Locked Door. Search the middle and
  upper portions of the room to find them.
 *Two Red Coins are in the first grouping in the Boo area, and two more
  are in the third.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is above the first block bridge triggered by the
  switch (in the Lava area).
 *Shoot the rightmost "?" Cloud when you first enter the Staircase area
  and enter the door that comes out of it. Defeat the two Boos inside
  the get a Flower as a reward.
 *The third Flower is in the Locked Door. Look in the upper right
  portion of the room.
 *The fourth Flower is right after the first Middle Ring, in the middle
  path of the Staircase area.
 *The last Flower is in the Boo area. Along the ceiling is a cracked
  block. Destroy it with an egg, then jump into the opening and run to
  the left. Enter the door at the end, and inside shoot one of the
  Balloon Boos three times. A switch will fall, giving you a step up to
  the Flower in the upper left corner.

-Level Layout-

Lakitu Sky Area ---> Lakitu Ground Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
In this level, you'll be introduced to the pesky Lakitu. In most cases, eat his
cloud as soon as he appears to get rid of him. When the level begins, pound
down the first post to find a Red Coin. At the end of the first Teetering Log
is another Red Coin. Stock up on eggs from the Egg Flower above the dirt, then
continue on. The last coin above the fourth Teetering Log is a Red Coin. Now,
you'll come to several long stretches of dirt. Above the first is a Flying Shy
Guy with a Red Coin. After it is a "?" Cloud in the air, which contains a
Flower. Following the Flower is a Star Tulip. Spit one of the Shy Guys, or even
better a shell into it to collect the stars. Continue on and through the
tunnel. Right outside the exit of the tunnel is a Star Cloud. In the air here
is a line of dirt, with coins above it. Two of them are Red Coins. Either send
a few eggs through the dirt or clear the wall of dirt on the right side and
jump up to the line from the dirt "stairs" surrounding the crate. Try not to
hit any shells, except when clearing the dirt around the crate. Do so with
shells and eggs, then push the crate over to the platform to the right (there's
two Red coins above it). If you accidentally shot the dirt away to the right of
it, stomp the right side and the key will fly to the left. Pick it up, the
shoot an egg through the dirt to the right to collect a Flower. Above this
Flower is a Star Cloud. Continue, and right before the Catching Cactus is a Red
Coin. Eat the Mini-Cactus that is being thrown, then jump over the Catching
Cactus. Enter the Locked door to the right of it and transform into a Train.
The only collectible item on the tracks is a Flower. Head to the top, then take
the middle path to get it. Exit, and push the Chomp Rock over to the right to
provide a step up to the door. Now you'll be in the Lakitu Ground area. At the
beginning of the area are two Red Coins, and just beyond them two Quick Flying
Shy Guys (each with a Red Coin) will float down for a second and quickly leave.
There's also a Star Cloud in this beginning section. Now, head to the right,
and bounce up the Small Arrow Ball. Before the Bubble Flower are two more Quick
Flying Shy Guys. Grab the Red Coins they carry fast. Right after the Bubble
Flower is another one. Right after this guy is a "?" Cloud containing a Flower,
and right after that is a Star Cloud. When the Round Cactus falls from the sky,
knock him away and pound down the posts underneath him to find a Red Coin. Now
you're near the end. Bounce up to the "?" Cloud between the raised ground and
break it open to uncover a Flower. Also here is a Star Cloud, a Red Coin, a Red
Coin in the post, and a Flying Shy Guy carrying a Red Coin. Continue to the end
(don't go into the gray-colored bush, a Bandit lurks there).

 *There's a Red Coin right before the Catching Cactus.
 *Find two Red Coins at the beginning of the Lakitu Ground Area.

  down, and use his cloud to fly up to the top left corner of this area.
  Pound down the post here two times (no more!), then enter the small
  cave. A Hidden Cloud is inside. Shoot it, and stomp the switch. Use
  the remaining elevation of the post to jump above the cave, and warp
  into a Hidden area. This place is filled with coins.

-Level Layout-

Starting Area ---> Hut Area ---> Post Area (Star Tulip Cave) --->
Wall Lakitu Area ---> Car Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is the only level to feature the Car transformation, which is
actually quite fun to use. Right near the start of the level are two egg
blocks, one red and one yellow. Instead of collecting them, use them to jump up
to the ledge above. Up here is a Flower. There's also a "?" Cloud. Before
shooting it, pound down the post and collect the Red Coin hidden in it. Now
shoot the "?" Cloud, and it'll form a bridge. As you cross, three Flying shy
Guys will drop down carrying Red Coins. Quickly grab them. The area up ahead is
filled with Wall Lakitus, so be careful (you may want to use a Sumo egg to rid
them from the area and get some stars). At the beginning of this area is a Star
Cloud, and further down is a Red Coin. Proceed to the very end and make your
way to the Rotating Platform. Above it is a Star Cloud, and to the right is the
key to the Mini-Game Hut you passed earlier. Play the Gather Coins mini-game,
then head back to the egg blocks that you came up on. Head down the path until
you reach the first dirt mound. Jump up and to the right to find a Flower. In
the right post underneath it is a Red Coin as well. Continue down the path
until you reach the Bullet Bill cannons. Wait for them to fire, then start
pounding down the posts. Watch for them to begin firing again, and at that
moment get out of the way. Inside the posts are two Red Coins. Pounding them
down will also let you get to the next part of the level (and a Middle Ring).
Enter the door underneath the Middle Ring. Inside, walk over to the very left,
and use a Sumo egg to destroy the Tap Tap. Now you can reach the Flower it was
guarding. Enter the door to the right of the Flower, and head into the pipe. In
this place, quickly run across the Falling Blocks, and if you're fast enough,
at the end you'll be able to reach the two Red Coins on the high ledge. Go into
the next pipe, and pound down the posts to the right of the Big Flower to find
a Red Coin. To the left of the Big Flower are five posts. The middle (third)
one contains a Red Coin. Bounce off the Large Arrow Ball here and to the right.
You'll land on some Clouds. Jump to the leftmost one, the leap all the way to
the leftmost side of this area. Over here is a Hidden Cloud on the wooden pole.
Shoot it to uncover a switch, then follow the arrow. In this area, pound the
dirt in the second from the left column and you'll go through a Flower. Go into
the pipe at the bottom and you'll come back to the Post Area. You'll drop down
onto a platform that has two Red Coins above it. Now head back to the right,
and you'll come a cross a Flying Shy Guy with a Red Coin. Get it. Then climb
the stairs to the top of the raised ground. up here is a Star Cloud and a post
containing a Red Coin. Jump over to the left posts surrounding the Star Tulip
cave and pound it all the way to the bottom to find a Red Coin. In this cave is
a Star Tulip, as well as two Red Coins underneath it. Now head back to where
you fell down from the pipe and go down into the Wall Lakitu area. In here are
several clouds, some containing co

~LEVEL 2-8: THE POTTED GHOST'S CASTLE~
Type: Castle          Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Dark Blue
No. of Coins: 102     No. of Stars: 40          No. of "?" Clouds: ?
Enemies: Small Lava Flame, Outline Shy Guy, Missile Shy Guys, Shy Guy,

Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Train

-Level Layout-

Lava Area ---> Spike Area ---> Missile Shy Guy Area --->
Spike Log Area ---> Arrow Globe Area ---> Bandit Area ---> Boss

-Level Walkthrough-
The level begins in a Lava-filled area. Above the posts that bob in the first
section of lava are two Red Coins. Above the second set of posts in the lava
are three more Red Coins. Jump on the second Guided Platform and follow it down
its path to go through a Flower. Now jump across the dropping Platforms (above
the yellow one is a Red Coin), and to the Middle Ring at the end of the lava
area. Enter the pipe, and take the Arrow Globe to the upper left corner of the
Spike area. Go into the pipe here, and morph into the Train. Take the upper
path to reach a Flower (the only collectible item in here). Leave the Train
room and take the Arrow Globe across to the upper right corner of the Spike
area, collecting the three Red Coins in the middle. Go into the pipe to come to
a dark tunnel. In this tunnel, the bottom left path leads to the Missile Shy
Guy area (your first destination), the bottom right leading to a Red Coin, and
the upper right leading out. Enter the Missile Shy Guy area, where a Star Cloud
awaits above the Shy Guy pipe. If you want to make the Missile Shy Guys drop
the bomb, pound the ground. Further down the path is an easily visible Flower.
Shoot an egg through the dirt to get it. Near the end of the hallway is a small
line of dirt with a Red Coin above it. At the end of the hall is another Star
Cloud and a pot. Push the pot off the ledge to the right to get the key, then
head back to the tunnel area and through the upper right opening. In here,
shoot the "?" part of the Spiked Log & Chain to raise it, then run underneath
it. Enter the pipe and go into the next dark tunnel. The upper left path leads
to a Middle Ring, the upper right path leads to two Red Coins and the exit, and
the lower right path leads to a room with two Bouncing Burts (destroy both to
get a Flower). Head to the exit after you collect all the items, and get past
the Spiked Log & Chains by shooting the circular "?" at the top. Underneath the
second Spiked Log and Chain is a Flower. Right past this is the Arrow Globe
area. Take the Arrow Globe up through the coins to collect three Red Coins,
then head to the top. Destroy the single spikey patch at the top to find a "?"
Cloud. Shoot it to unveil a door. Enter and you'll be in the Bandit area. In
this room are four Red Coins and a Middle Ring at the top. The key to the door
in the lower right corner is in the pot in the upper left corner. Watch out for
Bandits. Enter the door, and go through the Middle Ring. Down the path a bit
more is the door leading to the boss.

-BOSS: The Potted Ghost-
The Potted Ghost lives in a pot, so he can't move without the aid of his Shy
Guy buddies. He also can't hurt you, but the blue flames he spits out can.
Whenever you get the chance, push the pot over to the right. You're stronger
than the two Shy Guys, but if you let them be, they'll move the pot over to the
left, leaving you less and less room until eventually you're forced into the
pit. To win, keep pushing until the Potted Ghost spits out the three blue
flames (his chomp attack won't hurt you, it'll only knock you back). Wait for
them to dissipate, then push some more. Eventually, you'll push the Shy Guys
and The Potted Ghost into the pit on the right, clearing this level and this
world.

~EXTRA 2: HIT THAT SWITCH~
Type: Sky             Difficulty: Medium Hard   Yoshi Color: Green
No. of Coins: 65      No. of Stars: 22          No. of "?" Clouds: 2
Enemies: Piranha Plant
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
This is by far my favorite level in the game, due to its fast pace and overall
fun. You'll need to memorize what to do and have quick reflexes if you want to
beat it. When you begin the level, head over to the left and down the pipe.
Inside are two Star Clouds and two crates. Get them all to fill up on Stars, as
these are the only ones in the level. Head back up and stomp the first switch.
Quickly dash up the stairs, and onto the first platform (red, like all the
rest). You'll shoot up into the air, and go to the left. When you see the
second switch on some blocks above, jump up. The longer you can avoid hitting
it, the better. When the platform comes back around, jump back on it. It'll fly
across the sky, where you'll collect four Red Coins. Skip the first Large Arrow
Ball and continue across the blocks to the right. Soon you'll reach a second
Large Arrow Ball. Bounce off of it to go through the first Flower, the run over
to the left to hit the switch. On top of these blocks are four Red Coins, so
don't miss them. After the switch is tripped, head back to the right and onto
the next red platform. Duck down to fit under the blocks, and jump over the
Piranha Plant to collect a Flower and two Red Coins. Repeat the process on the
next platform. The platform after the second Piranha Plant will take you
through the air and through two Red Coins. Jump off at the end and hit the
switch next to the Large Arrow Ball. After the life of the blocks has been
renewed, bounce up and over the taller column of blocks, collecting the two Red
Coins and the Flower on the top. Fall down the other side and land on the right
side of the next red platform. By standing on that side, you can jump on top of
the blocks at the end of the path. Bounce off the Large Arrow Ball here and
collect the Flower and two Red Coins at the apex of the leap. Instead of
jumping on the next red platform, wait for the switch power to run out. If you
don't you'll run into a wall of blocks. When they disappear, jump on and take
the platform to the goal.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *At the beginning of the level, head to the left and into the pipe.
  Down here are two Star Clouds and two Crates.
~Red Coins:
 *After the second switch, you'll fly through the air and through four
  Red Coins.
 *To the right of the third switch are four Red Coins.
 *Above the two Piranha Plants are three Red Coins (each).
 *After the second Piranha Plant, the red platform will jump rocket
  through the sky, passing through two Red Coins.
 *After the fourth switch, you'll bounce over the wall, and at the top
  of the jump are two Red Coins.
 *After the fourth Large Arrow Ball (the second after the fourth
  switch), you'll leap into two more Red Coins (next to the Flower.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is after the first leap through the air. Bypass the
  first Arrow Ball and instead go to the second one to the right of it.
  You'll leap up into the Flower.
 *The second Flower is above the first Piranha Plant.
 *The third Flower is above the second Piranha Plant.
 *The fourth Flower is at the apex of the Large Arrow Ball bounce (after
  the fourth switch).
 *The final Flower is at the apex of the second Large Arrow Ball bounce
  after the fourth switch.

Forest Area ---> Lake Area ---> Vine Climb ---> Jungle Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
The first level of World 3 is filled with vibrant scenery and a new cast of
characters, to make the locales more unique. This level will introduce you to
the jungle, where the Monkeys reign supreme. The first item in this level is
found inside the first post. Ah, but it isn't a Red Coin, but a Hidden Cloud
which contains Stars. Underneath the first tree in the level is a Red Coin, and
above the first pit is a Flower. Immediately before the second post in the
level is a Red Coin, and above the post is a Star Cloud. Pound down the post
itself to find a Red Coin. After this post, jump off the end of the log to the
right to reach the second Flower and the Red Coin beneath it. At the end of the
forest area is a Red Coin. Now head to the muddy slopes of the Lake Area. Under
the first Missile-dropping Monkey is a Red Coin, and not far after is a Middle
Ring. Hop down the slope and into the lake (at this point, look at the "1-Up
Locations" section of this level to find a few 1-Ups). Above the second and
third small islands in the water are Red Coins. A Flower also resides above the
Lake, as well as a Red Coin underneath it. Continue to the eastern shore of the
lake and grab the Red Coin above the posts, and pound down the third post to
find another Red Coin. Between the third and fourth posts is a Star Cloud. Now
you'll reach the Vine Climb, a vertical ascension amidst a grouping of vines,
although you'll never actually climb the vines yourself. A little ways up and
on the right side is a "?" Cloud containing a Flower, and above the third
Piranha plant is a Red Coin. Now continue on into the Jungle Area. Above the
first pit are two Red Coins, and above the third to last pit in this section is
another Red Coin. Enter the second part of the Jungle Area, where a Red Coin
resides in the first post. There's also a Red Coin under the first chain of
Swinging Monkeys. After the second pit is a Red Coin, as well as one under the
first Teetering Log. The final Red Coin floats underneath the second chain of
Swinging Monkeys.


-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *Pound down the first post to find a Hidden Cloud. This is a Star
  Cloud.
 *Shoot the "?" Cloud above the second post to get some extra stars.
 *There's a Middle Ring near the start of the Lake Area, right before
  the steep, muddy slope.
 *On the eastern shore of the Lake, there's a "?" Cloud between the
  second and third posts. It's a Star Cloud.
~Red Coins:
 *The first Red Coin dangles beneath the first tree in the level.
 *Before the second post you'll come across a Red Coin.
 *Pound down the second post to find a Red Coin.
 *Under the second Flower (after the second post) is another Red Coin.

  is a Red Coin.
 *At the beginning of the Lake Area, look under the first Throwing
  Monkey to find a Red Coin.
 *In the lake, above the second and third islands are Red Coins (two
  total).

  on the left side (about halfway up).
 *The last Flower is above the first Teetering Log in the Jungle Area.

-1-Up Locations-
 *When you first arrive at the water of the Lake Area, swim over to the
  left part (near the muddy embankment). Jump out of the water and do
  the pound move. Press and hold left as you do this, and you'll go
  underneath the ground. Continue over until you surface. Jump up and
  out of the water and use the Large Arrow Ball to jump up above the
  trees. In this area, you'll fall down a series of Donut Lifts while
  six Shy Guys carrying 1-Ups fly by. Don't be shy about using eggs, as
  there's plenty to grab on the way down. Six 1-Ups will be very handy
  in the future.

Enemies: Mini Milde, Spear Shy Guy, Cannibal Shy Guy, Tap-Tap, Piranha
         Plant, Flying Shy Guy
Mini-Games: Throwing Balloons (4)
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Native Shy Guy Area ---> Floating Platform Area ---> Mountain Climb --->
Mountaintop Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
Level 3-2 is a somewhat sort trek through the jungle, up a cliff, and across a
mountaintop. There isn't anything to collect until you reach a couple of Spear
Shy Guys patrolling under a rock. Behind them are three Red Coins and a Flower.
Wait until they turn around, then eat/shoot an egg to clear them out. After
this rock is a clearing in which several Cannibal Shy Guys dance. A Flying Shy
Guy will fly down above them, so be ready to grab the Red Coin that it carries.
There's another Red Coin on the ground. Also in the Cannibal Shy Guy's clearing
are two "?" Clouds. One contains a Key and the other is a Star Cloud. Continue
down the path and you'll soon enter a rocky area. After the first Tap-Tap is a
Flower and a Star Tulip. Keep hopping to the right and you'll come across a
Swinging Platform. To the right of it is a Middle Ring. Jump on the Swinging
Platform, and ride it to the top. Activate both Platform Blocks, and use the
left one to reach the four Red Coins above it (you may want to wait until you
swing around again). After you've collected these, use the right platform to
reach the area above (and a Flower). Climb up the rocks until you reach the
Rotating Platform. Above it are two clouds. One contains a Flower, and the
other activates the stairs. Take the stairs up and you'll reach a second
Rotating Platform. To the left on the ground is an Egg Flower and two Red
Coins. Jump back to the Rotating Platform, and ride to the top. From there,
jump (and maintain your height by fluttering) a far as you can to the left.
You'll enter an area inside the trees, where four Red Coins and the Mini-Game
Hut wait (you'll play Throwing Balloons). Exit when you finish, and head to the
right of the Rotating Platform where two more Red Coins wait. Above the
Cannibal Shy Guys is a Flower, and above the Piranha Plant a Flying Shy Guy
will fly down with a Red Coin. Finally, above the second set of Cannibal Shy
Guys on the mountaintop are two Red Coins. Now simply head for the goal.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *Above the first Cannibal Shy Guys is a Star Cloud.
 *After you pass the first Tap-Tap, you'll come across a Star Tulip.
 *To the right of the Swinging Platform is a Middle Ring.

  Shy Guys patrolling underneath. Wait until they turn around, then
  eat/egg them to grab the three Red Coins under there.
 *Above the first group of Cannibal Shy Guys, a Flying Shy Guy will
  swoop down with a Red Coin. There's also another on the jungle floor.
 *Above and to the left of the Swinging Platform are four Red Coins.
  Smash the Platform Block there so you can reach them.
 *Head to the left of the second Rotating Platform to find an Egg Flower
  and two Red Coins.
 *Standing on the second Rotating Platform, jump to the left. You'll
  emerge inside the trees, where four Red Coins hide behind the leaves.
 *To the right of the second Rotating Platform are two Red Coins.
 *Above the Piranha Plant on the mountaintop is a Flying Shy Guy. Grab
  his Red Coin before he flies away.
 *Look above the second group of Cannibal Shy Guys on the Mountaintop
  to find the last two Red Coins.

Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Submarine, Helicopter

-Level Layout-

Nep-enut Lake ---> Helicopter Lake ---> Submarine Lake --->
Froggy Area ---> Jumping Fish Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is filled with water, and you'll even get a chance to dive deep
below with the Submarine transformation. From the start of the level, continue
to the shore of the first lake. In each of these lakes is a Nep-enut, which is
best to subdue with an egg. Above the first Nep-enut is a Flower. On the land
after it is a Star Cloud. Above the second Nep-enut are two Red Coins, and in
the third Nep-enut's lake is another Red Coin (it's under the trees). Go up the
hill after it and above the left slope is a Flower. Five Red Coins and a Star
Cloud await your long voyage across the fourth Nep-enut lake, and a Star Cloud
will greet you on the other side. This marks the end of the Nep-enut Lake,
signified with a Middle Ring. In the Helicopter Lake, there's a Star Cloud
behind the first Watermelon Monkey. Continue over to the very right of the
level, and go under the rock that the door rests (it's in the "?" Cloud) on to
find a Red Coin. Then enter the door and eat all three of the Spear Shy Guys to
receive a Flower. When you come out, grab the Helicopter transformation bubble
to the left and fly through the rocks to the Yoshi Block. Enter the door to the
left, and you'll be in the Submarine Lake. Collect the Middle Ring, then plunge
down to the transformation bubble. The only item in this long stretch of water
is a Red Coin to the left of the first Spiked Ball & Chain. Soon you'll reach
the end of the Submarine Lake and surface. Activate the Middle Ring, then head
to the right. Under the two Flying Shy Guys is a Red Coin. Following this is a
two-level bridge, where after the second Giant Crab is a Red Coin. There's also
a Star Cloud above it. To the right a little more is a Flower, easily seen
underneath the bridges. Jump up on the platforms (to the left of them is a Red
Coin), and head down the first opening. At the bottom, on the very right end of
the water, is a Red Coin (destroy the Giant Crab first so you can get up more
easily, and where it stood is another Red Coin). Head back up and go down the
stairs to the right, and you'll run into a Red Coin. Enter the door at the
bottom. In the Jumping Fish Area you just entered are several items. Above the
first bridge are two Red Coins, as well as a Flower. There's a Star Cloud after
the Flower, too. Finally, after climbing the stairs, pound down the post to the
lowest bridge and you'll find a Red Coin. Now you can run to the Goal.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *After the first Nep-enut Lake, there's a Star Cloud.

 *When taking the two platforms up to the muddy area, jump to the left
  to collect a Red Coin.
 *The first opening in the muddy area leads to a Giant Crab and some
  water. In the water, on the right, is a Red Coin. Another Red Coin
  hides behind the Giant Crab (defeat it to be able to get it).
 *In the muddy area, take the stairs down to the door and you'll go
  right through a Red Coin.
 *In the Jumping Fish Area, above the first bridge are two Red Coins.
 *Pound down the large post after the large set of stairs (in the
  Jumping Fish area), and head across the lowest bridge to get the last
  Red Coin.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is above the first Nep-enut Lake.
 *Look for the second Flower on the hill after the third Nep-enut Lake.
 *The third Flower is on the very right end of the Helicopter Lake.
  Shoot the "?" Cloud above the monkeys and enter the door. Inside, eat
  or shoot all of the Spear Shy Guys to be rewarded a Flower.
 *The fourth Flower is located After the Flying Shy Guys but before
  the muddy area (in the Froggy Area). It's underneath a bridge.
 *The final Flower is above the first bridge in the Jumping Fish Area.

-1-Up Locations-
 *When you emerge from the Submarine Lake, head right a little ways and
  two Flying Shy Guys carrying 1-Ups will swoop down. Grab 'em.

~LEVEL 3-4: PRINCE FROGGY'S FORT~
Type: Castle/Water    Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Yellow
No. of Coins: 62      No. of Stars: 30          No. of "?" Clouds: 10
Enemies: Jumping Fish, Monkey, Spear Shy Guy, Shy Guy, Fake Flower,
         Giant Crab, Spiked Ball & Chain, Water Spitting Fish, Slimes,
         Missile Shy Guys, Froggy, Mini-Cactus
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Submarine

-Level Layout-

Outside Area ---> Flooded Ruins ---> Crab Tunnel ---> Slime Tunnel --->
Froggy Area ---> Prince Froggy

-Level Walkthrough-
Prince Froggy's Fort is unlike any other castle. This one is flooded by water,
and you'll definitely be taking a dip before you reach the Frog Prince. In the
Outside Area (at the beginning), head down the path until you reach some Spikey
patches (the blue/gray spikes that can be cleared with eggs). Underneath one of
the lower right patches is a "?" Cloud, which when shot will lead to a
Submarine area. In these waters are two Red Coins. Exit, then head to the right
and into the Castle. Above the first Jumping Fishes are two Red Coins. Enter
the first door and look around to find three Red Coins and a Star Cloud (in the
door in this room, defeat both Giant Crabs to receive a Flower). Exit back into
the main passage and continue to the right. Above the first Spiked Ball & Chain
is a Red Coin, and beneath the second is a Flower. There's two Red Coins
beneath the third Spiked Ball & Chain. Enter the door just beyond to find three
Red Coins, then go back out. Further in the ruins you'll find a Self-Rotating
Platform. Ride it across the river and you'll be able to reach some items
above, including a Flower, a Star Cloud, and later on two Red Coins (underneath
the fourth set of Missile Shy Guys). At the end of the Castle Ruins area is a
Middle Ring. Now head into the Crab Tunnel. When you come across a Giant Crab,
run back to where there's an opening in the wall. Lure the Crab back, and jump
over it. In the middle of the tunnel are three Red Coins. Continue through the
tunnel, out the door, and into the Slime Tunnel. Shoot the "?" Clouds to make
bridges across the spikes (watch out for Slimes!), but before you shoot the
third, shoot the Flower right above the spikes. Not far after you'll come to a
Self-Rotating Platform (and before it a Star Cloud). Ride it across the spikes,
and be sure to collect the Flower that comes up along the way. Enter the door
at the other end, and you'll come to a Middle Ring. Leap up the steps, and
you'll be right outside Prince Froggy's Room.

-BOSS: Prince Froggy-
Prince Froggy is much like any other Froggy you've encountered thus far.
Surprisingly, Kamek will not turn him into a gigantic Frog, but will instead
shrink you so you can be a quick snack for the Prince. The battle takes place
inside his stomach (yes, it really does). Stand in the exact middle (above
the... um... "excrement" tunnel) and you'll avoid the acid drops that fall
down. Every once in a while Prince Froggy will eat a Shy Guy, which will come
down. Slurp it up and shoot the egg at the uvula (what's it doing in the
stomach? who knows) to hurt Prince Froggy. Soon he'll get an upset stomach and
he'll... um... "excrete" you out. It must feel good going through there.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *In the Castle Ruins, go inside the first door and to the right to find
  a Star Cloud.
 *Use the Self-Rotating Platform to reach the Star Cloud above the
  water in the Castle Ruins.
 *At the end of the Castle Ruins, there's a Middle Ring.
 *Right before the Self-Rotating Platform in the Slime Tunnel is a Star
  Cloud.
 *In the Froggy Area before Prince Froggy's Room, there's a Middle Ring.
~Red Coins:
 *Clear out the first Spikey Patch you come across to find a "?" Cloud.
  Shoot it and enter the door. You'll transform into a Submarine, and
  two Red Coins wait above and below the Spiked Ball & Chain.
 *Two Red Coins are near the beginning of the Castle Ruins, above the
  first few Jumping Fish.
 *Enter the first door in the Castle Ruins to find three Red Coins.
 *Above the first Spiked Ball & Chain in the Castle Ruins is a Red Coin.
 *Beneath the third Spiked Ball & Chain in the Castle Ruins are two Red
  Coins.
 *Enter the second door in the Castle Ruins to find three Red Coins.
 *While riding across the lake on the Self-Rotating Platform, you'll
  come across two Red Coins (underneath the fourth set of Missile Shy
  Guys).
 *The last three Red Coins are found in the middle of the Crab Tunnel.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is found in the first door in the Castle Ruins.
  Inside, head to the right and enter the door there, then defeat both
  Giant Crabs. A Flower will appear.
 *The second Flower is found underneath the second Spiked Ball & Chain
  in the Castle Ruins.
 *Use the Self-Rotating Platform to reach the Flower above the water in
  the Castle Ruins.
 *The fourth Flower is in the Slime Tunnel, after the second bridge.
  It's waiting for you right above the spikes.
 *Also in the Slime Tunnel, the fifth Flower is along the route of the
  Self-Rotating Platform.

~LEVEL 3-5: JAMMIN' THROUGH THE TREES~
Type: Jungle          Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Purple
No. of Coins: 211     No. of Stars: 48          No. of "?" Clouds: 7
Enemies: Monkey, Throwing Monkey, Watermelon Monkey, Gusty, Shy Guy,
         Cactus Piranha Plant, Flying shy Guy
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Dirt Area ---> Rotating Platform Area ---> Rocky Area --->
Treetop Area ---> Monkey Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level takes you through the trees and above dangerous pits in the depths
of the monkey jungle. The first part of the level takes place inside large
fields of dirt, that you'll need to clear out of the way with eggs or
watermelon seeds if you want to proceed. After the second Egg Block is a Star
Tulip. The Mini-Cactus' pot, found after the dirt wall, is good for spitting
into it. Speaking of beyond the next dirt wall, that's where two Red Coins and
a "?" Cloud containing a Flower are. Continue on until you reach the third Egg
Block (there's a lot of these, aren't there?). In the dirt to the right is a
Hidden Cloud, which contains five stars. Soon the path will be totally blocked
by dirt. Shoot eggs to get through it, as well as to collect the Flower, Red
Coin in the coin line above, the Red Coin in the coin line below, and a Star
Cloud in the dirt right underneath the upper coin line. Now continue on to the
next area. When you come to the first two Rotating Platforms, collect the two
higher coins, as they are Red Coins. There's a Middle Ring right after the
third Rotating Platform. Over the pit of spikes are four more Red Coins,
between this level's fourth and fifth Rotating Platforms. After the Shy Guy
pipe, there's a tiny hole in the ground. Jump into it and you'll make a Hidden
Cloud materialize. Shoot it (this is hard, but try to shoot as straight down as
possible) and five stars will pop out. Just beyond this point is a post. Grab
the watermelon from the Monkey to the left, then pound down the post four times
(no more!). Spit a watermelon seed to the left and you'll get the Flower. Next,
go to where the Monkey was, and below it are four Red Coins. Now continue to
the exit of the area, but you'll see a Flower right before it. Bank an egg off
the wall to collect it. You'll come to an area where you jump across treetops.
Above the first Cactus Piranha Plant are two Red Coins, and there's two more
above the second one (as well as a 1-Up carrying Flying Shy Guy). When you get
to the end of the treetops, you'll see more below. Right below where the second
Cactus Piranha Plant was are two more Red Coins. If you continue down the lower
treetops, you'll enter a new, bonus area. Here shoot the Hidden Cloud that the
arrow points to and us the Red Switch to go to the platform that takes you
across the sky, collecting coins, stars, and possibly five 1-Ups. When you're
done, go back to the end of the treetops. To the right is land, and in between
the Throwing Monkeys and the trees is a Star Cloud. To the very right is a
Switch. Hitting it will allow you to get the outlined coins, whose path you
should follow to continue through the level. After passing the second tree high
in the air, drop down to the rocks below. You'll see a Flower below, and you'll
only have to shoot an egg to get it. Climb back up on top of the tree and over
the stone wall. When you reach the land below, you'll be near the goal.

~LEVEL 3-6: THE CAVE OF HARRY HEDGEHOG~
Type: Cave            Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Brown
No. of Coins: 381     No. of Stars: 33          No. of "?" Clouds: 8
Enemies: Harry Hedgehog, Cave Rat, Lantern Ghoul
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Mole Tank

-Level Layout-

Outside Cave Area ---> Cave Area ---> End Area ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
The Cave of Harry Hedgehog isn't a large level, but it'll still take you a
while to get through it. Being a cave level, there are many different ways to
go and paths to take. You begin outside the cave, in the regular lush Jungle.
Watch out for the Monkeys, and jump onto the trees above the starting point.
Flutter jump over to the tall trees near the entrance to the cave (on the
ground), and you'll come to a higher cave entrance. Before you enter, grab the
four Red Coins outside. When you enter the cave, a Flower will greet you. Grab
it and drop down below. To the right you'll find a Key, then go back to where
you dropped down and bounce to the top using the Large Arrow Ball. Where you
land is a Star Tulip, and you'll need to shoot an egg so it bounces off the
ceiling just right to get the stars inside. Continue right and drop down into
the main cave area. Move to the right until you see a "?" Cloud above a
mushroom. Shoot it to make stairs appear, and climb them. In this high,
Mushroom-filled area there's four Red Coins, a Flower, and a Star Cloud. Jump
back down and go right until you reach a Chomp Rock. Push it down the hills and
all the way over until it runs into the wall. Use it as a step to get up to the
level above. From here head left, and shoot the "?" Cloud to make a Flower
grow. Jump up it and go over to the left, where a Mole Tank bubble is (the two
coins to either side of it are Red Coins, by the way). When you transform,
you'll drop down far below. When you hit the ground, head left through the
tunnels. The four coins on the bottom are Red Coins, and don't miss the Flower
in the middle (though it'd be kinda hard to). When you reach the end, jump off
the Large Arrow Ball, getting rid of the yellow egg block (so you don't have to
transform anymore), but first head to the right before jumping to the top.
You'll come across a Star Cloud, and at the end a pipe. Enter the pipe and
shoot the "?" Cloud to make a Switch appear. Hit it and run through the coin
field. Right before it runs out, hit the switch at the other end, jump to the
top, and dash back to the left. Grab the Flower at the end, then collect coins
until time runs out. Exit the pipe and head back to the Large Arrow Ball.
Spring up above, and jump to the right. On the floating island there's a Middle
Ring and a Star Cloud. To the right of the floating island, be sure to grab the
Flower and the three Red Coins when you jump to the floating mushroom (don't be
afraid to fall if you have to, you'll just have to go back to the Large Arrow
Ball). From the mushrooms above, follow the line of coins (four of these coins
are Red Coins) to the Key Door on a lower mushroom. Enter and you'll be in the
End Area. Right above the entrance is a Hidden Cloud, but before you shoot it,
go out into the open and look up. You'll see another cloud. Shoot it to make
stairs appear, then go back a shoot the Hidden Cloud. A switch will appear, and
when you climb the stairs with it activated, you'll find a bunch of coins. From
here simply go right and you'll come to the exit
-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *If you take the upper entrance from the Outside Cave Area, the Large
  Arrow Ball inside will take you to a Star Tulip. Bank the egg off the
  ceiling (stand just to the right of the Star Tulip and aim up) to get
  it in.
 *When you see a "?" Cloud over a mushroom in the higher part of the
  first half of the Cave Area, shoot it to make stairs appear. Above is
  a Star Cloud.
 *Bounce off the Large Arrow Ball after the Mole Tank tunnels to get
  high above the level, then go right to get to the floating island.
  There's a Star Cloud here.
 *Also on the floating island is a Middle Ring.
 *Below the floating island you'll find a Star Cloud.
~Red Coins:
 *If you jump from the treetops to the higher entrance at the beginning
  of the level, you'll find four Red Coins.
 *When you see a "?" Cloud over a mushroom in the higher part of the
  first half of the Cave Area, shoot it to make stairs appear. Above are
  four Red Coins.
 *To either side of the Mole Tank bubble are Red Coins (two total).
 *In the Mole Tank tunnels, the bottom row of four coins are all Red
  Coins.
 *Between the floating island (where the Middle Ring is) and the
  mushroom to the right are three Red Coins.
 *Follow the line of coins from the high mushrooms to the Key Door to
  get three Red Coins.
~Flowers:
 *The first Flower is right inside the higher entrance to the Cave
  Area. Jump from the treetops outside to reach it.
 *Look for the second Flower from the stairs that you create from the
  "?" Cloud above the mushroom in the first half if the Cave Area.
 *Flower 3 can be found in the Mole Tank Tunnels. It's quite easy to
  see.
 *The fourth Flower sits inside the enemy pipe at the very right end of
  the Cave Area. Go inside and hit the switches, then race to the top
  to grab the Flower in time.
 *The last Flower is in between the floating island and the high
  mushrooms. Grab it as you flutter across.

~LEVEL 3-7: MONKEY'S FAVORITE LAKE~
Type: Lake/Jungle     Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Red
No. of Coins: 165     No. of Stars: 35          No. of "?" Clouds: 11
Enemies: Monkey, Stilt Shy Guy, Crab, Castfish, Jumping Fish,
         Swinging Monkeys, Flying Shy Guy, Fake Flowers,
         Cannibal Shy Guys, Bubble Guy
Mini-Games: Popping Balloons
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Lake Area 1 ---> Lake Area 2 ---> Post Area ---> Catfish Lake Area
---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
This level has a ton of water in it, and most of the time you'll be trudging
through it. You start out in the water, and you'll need to head right. After
the first island is a Star Cloud. Soon after you'll see a Rotating Platform.
Use it to get out of the water and start it rotating. Soon you'll come to a
Flower under the first group of Swining Monkeys. At the end of the Rotating
Platform line is a rocky island. The small pit on top contains a Hidden Cloud.
Shoot it with an egg and a Switch will appear. Hit the switch and follow the
arrow that's to the left. You'll warp to an underground chamber filled with
water, and you'll need to transform into the submarine. There are five Red
Coins to be found there. When you exit the Submarine area, go on to the next
area, Lake Area 2. Not far from the entrance is a Star Cloud, and right after
the first island is a Flying Shy Guy that drops down for a few moments with a
Red Coin. Continue through the waters until you pass the first Crab. There's a
"?" Cloud here, and shoot it to make a Growing Flower appear. It'll take you up
to an Egg Block and even better, a Flower. Right after this Growing Flower is
an area with missile Throwing Monkeys, and in the middle of this area is a Star
Cloud. Continue right until you see another "?" Cloud. Shoot it and another
Growing Flower will appear. Climb to the top and jump up to transport Yoshi to
a treetop place. There are four Red Coins above the first part of the treetops,
as well as a Flower at the end. Jump over the pit with the coin arrow (the coin
at the very point of the arrow is a Red Coin) to the second part, where a Star
Cloud and 1-Up await. Drop down the pit at the end to return to the Lake Area
2. To the left are some trees, as well as Fake Flowers. Above the second Fake
Flower are two Red Coins. Continue on and you'll come to the Post Area. Bounce
off the Large Arrow Ball to the place above. Begin pounding down the tall post.
There are Two Red Coins in the top area, and a Flower in the second. Pound down
the post all the way now and go right and up to find a Middle Ring. Now
continue on to the next area, Catfish Lake. Above one of the first lakes are
two Red Coins. Continue on until you reach some rocks with Fake Flower s above
them. Go underneath these rocks and swim to the right (don't worry about the
Catfish, just move fast) to find a Red Coin and a Flower. Also here is a "?"
Cloud containing a key, and the Mini-Game Hut is right next to it! Enter to
play a quick game of Popping Balloons, then continue through the Lake. This
second half has water with coins just above the surface. To safely get these
coins, skip an egg across the water (just shoot one at the water and it'll
start skipping). The first and last of these lakes contain Red Coins,
completing the set with the final two. At the end of the Catfish Lake Area is a
"?" Cloud. It forms a bridge, and you can go back left to get a 1-Up nestled
between two large rocks. Right past the "?" Cloud that forms the bridge is the
Goal.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *After the first island in Lake Area 1, there's a Star Cloud.
 *In Lake Area 2, there's a Star Cloud near the entrance to the area.
 *After the first Growing Flower, in a vine-covered area with Throwing
  Monkeys, there's a Star Cloud up above the lake.
 *In the treetops (access them by activating the second Growing Flower),
  jump across the pit with the coin arrow to reach a Star Cloud.
 *In the Post Area, near the exit to the Catfish Lake Area, there's a
  Middle Ring.
 *Early on in the Catfish Lake Area, you'll come across a Star Cloud.
~Red Coins:
 *Near the end of the first area, jump in the small pit in between the
  rocks to find a Hidden Cloud containing a Switch. It'll show you the
  way to a Submarine area, where five Red Coins float in the waters.
 *Near the beginning of Lake Area 2, a Flying Shy Guy holding a Red Coin
  will swoop down for a few seconds. Grab the coin!
 *In the treetops (access them by activating the second Growing Flower),
  there are four Red Coins over the first section of trees.
 *Also in the treetops, above the large pit is an arrow made of coins.
  The coin at the point of the arrow is a Red Coin.
 *Near the end of Lake Area 2, there are two Red Coins above the second
  Fake Flower.
 *When pounding the tall post, go into the first level you come to to
  find two Red Coins.
 *Look for two Red Coins above one of the first lakes in the Catfish
  Lake Area.
 *In the middle of the Catfish Lake Area, go under the stone before the
  Fake Flowers, and swim to the right. You'll find a Red Coin along the
  way.
 *Near the end of the Catfish Lake, above the first and last lakes with
  coins just above the surface, shoot an egg across the water to collect
  two Red Coins.
~Flowers:
 *Where the firstchain of Swinging Monkeys is, there's also the first
  Flower (above the lake where you use the Rotating Platform).
 *After the first Crab in Lake Area 2, there's a "?" Cloud containing a
  Growing Flower. Climb the Flower's leaves to the second Flower.
 *At the end of the treetops' first part (right before the coin arrow)
  is where you can find the third Flower.
 *When pounding down the tall post, go into the second level you come to
  to find the fourth Flower.
 *In the middle of the Catfish Lake Area, go under the stone before the
  Fake Flowers, and swim to the right. You'll find a Flower along the
  way.

-1-Up Locations-
 *In the treetops (get to them by growing the second Growing Flower,
  found just a little ways after the first Growing Flower), jump across
  the pit with the coin arrow to more trees. Above these are two clouds,
  one containing a 1-Up.
 *In the Post Area, jump as high as you can off the Large Arrow Ball at
  the beginning, and soar onto or over the posts on the hill. On the
  right side of these posts is a Hidden Cloud, containing a 1-Up.
 *Above the Catfish Lake, you'll see a Cloud nestled between two large
  rocks in the air. At the end of the Lake, shoot the "?" Cloud to form
  a bridge, then go back to the cloud. Shoot an egg straight up to get
  the 1-Up inside the cloud.

~LEVEL 3-8: NAVAL PIRANHA'S CASTLE~
Type: Castle          Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Dark Blue
No. of Coins: 40      No. of Stars: 23          No. of "?" Clouds: 2
Enemies: Tunnel Boo, Piranha Plant, Path Piranha, Room Boo, Nippers,
     Scuba Lakitu, Cactus Piranha Plant
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Outside Area ---> Pipes Room 1 ---> Egg Bank Room ---> Pipes Room 3 --->
Central Room ---> Piranha Pipes ---> Naval Piranha ---> Goal

-Level Walkthrough-
Naval Piranha's Castle is overflowing with water, and you'll need to navigate
the intricate pipe system if you want to face off with the big plant itself.
Enter the castle and proceed past the Tunnel Boo. After making your way through
the first set of Flippers, head to the right and up to find the first Red Coin.
Go back down and continue to the lowest part of the Pipe Area 1, where a small
water-filled chamber houses two Red Coins. Continue on down the steep slope,
dodge the Piranha Plants, and enter the Egg Bank Room. Here you'll need to bank
eggs off the walls and skip them across the water to collect items. Four coins
under the entrance are Red Coins. On the middle island, bank an egg off the
wall to the left to get three Red Coins, and to the right to get two Red Coins
and a Flower. At the end of this area, behind a Piranha Plant, is the second
Flower. To the right of this are three more Red Coins (quite a few in this
room, huh?). Exit the room and go down another slope and continue right to find
a third Flower not to high above the path. Soon you'll come to the Central
Room. Kill the Cactus Piranha Plants, then jump through the Middle Ring. From
this room, go up and to the right. The room up above holds a Flower. Now head
back to the Center room and dive into the water at the bottom. Head left and
you'll start going down a passage. Make your way past the Scuba Lakitus, Room
Boos, and Piranha Plants to find a large room. At the top are three Red Coins
and a Star Cloud. Go back to the Central Chamber and continue down the path to
the right. You'll now be in the Piranha Pipes area. Use the bank shot you
learned earlier (shoot an egg off a wall onto the surface of the water, if you
forgot) to defeat the Piranha Plants. After the second Piranha Plant are two
Red Coins and a Flower. Now you're near the boss. Stock up on stars from the
Star Tulip right before the entrance to the boss' chamber, then enter.

-BOSS: Naval Piranha-
Naval Piranha looks intimidating at first, but all you need to do is land three
shots on the bandage that sits on a vine beneath the platform you're on. The
bank shots you learned earlier were just practice for this, the real test.
Naval Piranha will sometimes charge at you, and at this time (and a little bit
before and after) the bandage cannot be hit. To replenish your eggs, let the
Nipper spores Naval shoots land. If you manage to hit the sore spot three
times, you'll win.

*TRICK - There's an easier way to beat Naval Piranha. If you stand on the very
left edge of the white pebble platform, then throw an egg at Naval Piranha,
you'll hit Naval while he's still a tiny, normal Piranha Plant, killing him
without any trouble at all.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *In the middle of the central room, there's a Middle Ring.
 *Get into the water in the Central Room, swim to the left, and head
  down the tunnel. In the large room at the end, go to the top to find
  a Star Cloud.
 *A Star Tulip awaits right before the door to Naval Piranha. Hard to
  miss.
~Red Coins:
 *After the first set of Flippers, head to the top-right corner of the
  first Pipe Area to find a Red Coin.
 *In Pipes Room 1, head to the lower-left part to find two Red Coins.
 *Use the egg banking technique to skip the eggs off the water in the
  Egg Bank Room to collect twelve Red Coins... or just jump down into
  the water and swim to them.
 *Get into the water in the Central Room, swim to the left, and head
  down the tunnel. In the large room at the end, go to the top to find
  three Red Coins.
 *Make your way past the Piranha Plants near the end to find two Red
  Coins.
~Flowers:
 *Use the egg banking technique to skip the eggs off the water in the
  Egg Bank Room to collect the first and second Flowers.
 *The third Flower is down the second steep slope, right above the
  normal path.
 *From the Central Room, go up and to the right. You'll come to a room
  with a Flower in it.
 *Make your way past the Piranha Plants near the end to find the fifth
  and final Flower.

~EXTRA 3: MORE MONKEY MADNESS~
Type: Jungle          Difficulty: Hard          Yoshi Color: Green
No. of Coins: 81      No. of Stars: 10          No. of "?" Clouds: 2
Enemies: Flying Shy Guy, Monkey, Watermelon Monkey, Toadie
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Walkthrough-
This level is quite difficult, as you must navigate Rotating and Self-Rotating
platforms above pits with monkeys spitting watermelon seeds at you, walls
blocking your path, and Flying Shy Guys taunting you with hard-to-get Red
Coins. It's short, but definitely hard. Hang around at the start of the level
for a Flying Shy Guy to drop by with a Red Coin. Also at the beginning are two
Star Clouds. The line of coins nearby has two Red Coins, and the second post
also holds a Red Coin. Look above the first red platform for another Red Coin.
Between the first and second rotating platforms are two Red Coins. To get by
the second Rotating Platform, wait for the monkeys to spit their seeds, then
drop down to the lowest platform and then quickly up to the other side. There's
a Flower and two Red Coins here. Between Rotating Platforms three and four (and
two tall posts) is a Flower that can be easily gotten with an egg shot. In the
many coins after this platform (watch out for the watermelon seed! eat the
monkeys as soon as you can!) are three Red Coins. At the end of the ride, shoot
an egg at the Flower in front of the post. The fifth Rotating Platform has a
Red Coin around it, but you'll need to move incredibly fast (and be good with
your tongue) if you want to grab the Red Coin the Flying Shy Guy has on the
other side. On the other side of the wall at the top is a Flower. In the two
long lines of coins after the fifth Rotating Platform, there are four Red Coins
(two in each line). Now you'll be near the goal... but don't finish the level
yet. Two Flying Shy Guys will drop down with Red Coins, and there's a Flower
behind the Goal Ring. Finally, you'll notice you still don't have enough stars.
You'll need to use a +10 Star item to meet the score.

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 *Two Star Clouds wait at the beginning of the level.
 *Jump up and offscreen to the right of the wall near the first Flower to get
  into a secret area with two Crates and a Star Cloud.
~Red Coins:
 *At the beginning, a Flying Shy Guy will swoop down with a Red Coin.
 *Two Red Coins rest in the line of coins at the start.
 *Pound down the second post to find a Red Coin.
 *Above the first red platform, you'll spot a Red Coin.
 *Two Red Coins rest between Rotating Platforms 1 and 2.
 *Behind the wall above Rotating Platform 2 is a Red Coin.
 *In the field of coins and Watermelon Monkeys that you ride through
  with Rotating Platform 4 are three Red Coins.
 *A Red Coin waits in the coins around the fifth Rotating Platform.
 *A Flying Shy Guy drops by the right side of Rotating Platform 5 with
  a Red Coin. Be very careful while getting it, but don't dawdle.
 *After Rotating Platform 5, each of the two lines of coins you'll come
  across has two Red Coins.
 *Two Flying Shy Guys will drop in with Red coins right before the Goal
  Ring.
~Flowers:
 *Behind the wall above Rotating Platform 2 is the first Flower.
 *Look between Rotating Platforms 3 and 4 to find a Flower. It's
  easiest to get with an egg shot.
 *After riding the fourth Rotating Platform through the treetops, shoot
  an egg at the Flower near the post.
 *Behind the wall above Rotating Platform 5 is the fourth Flower.
 *The last Flower is behind the goal ring.

~ LEVEL 4-1: GO! GO! MARIO! ~
Type: Normal          Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Green
No. of Coins: 257     No. of Stars: 44          No. of "?" Clouds:3
Enemies: Koopa, Goomba, Piranha Plant, Shy Guy, Para-Koopa, Cactus Piranha
   Plant, Bandit, Bullet Bill, Fuzzy, Mad Butterflies
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Plains Area ---> Pipe Area ---> Bullet Bill Cannon Field ---> Fuzzy Area --->
Super Baby Mario Area ---> Goal


-Level Walkthrough-
This level starts out in the middle of a field. As you make your way through,
you'll encounter several Goomba and Koopas. A Flower is in plain view when you
come across the first group of Para-Koopas. Right after the Flower is a long
line of coins following a rising hill. The first and last coins in this line
are Red Coins. Soon you'll come to the Pipe Area, where you'll be surrounded by
pipes. The first pipe you encounter will spurt Shy Guys. Defeat the Piranha
Plants nearby, stock up on eggs, get some 1-Ups (see Secrets section), then go
on further into the Pipe Area. A Star Cloud floats in between two pipes just a
little ways down the path. Continue down to uncover a Cactus Piranha Plant.
Defeat it, then go down the pipe in front of it. The cave you'll emerge in
contains six Red Coins and a Crate near the end. Beware of Shy Guys and Bandits
hiding behind the crystals. When you emerge from the cavern, a Star Tulip will
be just to your left. Press on and you'll come to a place filled with Bullet
Bill Cannons. Bounce off a Bullet Bill from the first cannon up to the small
ledge above to find a Hidden Star Cloud. Jump back down and check in between
the first two cannons to find a Red Coin. Go all the way to the right and down
below the first cannons through a narrow passage. Along this path you'll find a
Flower, three Red Coins, and an Ice Watermelon which you can use to freeze even
Bullet Bill cannons. Jump back up to the top and to the path going higher than
the first two cannons. In the pits between the cannons here are Red Coins (a
total of two), but watch out for the Para-Troopas and Bullet Bills that are
flying around in there. Continue on into the next area and hit to Middle Ring.
This area is filled with your friends from World 1, Fuzzies. This time,
however, there are pits you must navigate over while dodging the Fuzzy ones. In
the large section of land in the Fuzzy Are, there's a small hole in the ground
that contains a Flower. If you hit a Fuzzy here, get to the land formation (if
you're not already on it), because trying to navigate the area with a pit below
while dizzy is NOT safe. Get through this area to find another Middle Ring.
Continue through this area, past the Enemy Pipe and down below. You'll soon see
a star above you bouncing. To free it, shoot the dirt blocking your path with
an egg. It'll drop down and you'll transform into Super Baby Mario. Start
running up the wall to the left and through the first coin line to uncover a
Red Coin. Continue running across the walls and ceiling and you'll eventually
cross a Flower. Continue running until you get to a drop-off. Here you'll want
to jump towards the masses of coins above and activate your parachute to float
through them. Each of the individual coins is a Red Coin (total of three), so
target those. There's also a Flower up here. If you miss any, drop down and
shoot eggs up to collect what you missed. The end is just a hop, skip and a
jump away from here.

~ LEVEL 4-2: THE CAVE OF THE LAKITUS ~
Type: Underground     Difficulty: Medium        Yoshi Color: Dark Red
No. of Coins: 157     No. of Stars: 26          No. of "?" Clouds: 3
Enemies: Piranha Plant, Shy Guy, Koopa, Wall Lakitus, Red-Nosed Tap-Taps,
   Lantern Ghouls, Flying Shy Guy, Bats
Mini-Games: Throwing Balloons (5)
Transformations: None

-Level Layout-

Outside Area ---> Cave Path ---> Lakitu Cave ---> Piranha Plant Path --->
Cave Path 2 ---> Lakitu Cave 2 ---> Ending Stretch ---> Goal


-Level Walkthrough-
You'll start the Level off outside in a single screen area with tons of Pipes.
Shoot the Piranha Plant on the far left and go into the pipe it was on. Down
here you'll have a chance to get a 1-Up. Wait for the arrow to point up and
left before shooting an egg at it. It will hit the Koopa and shoot its shell,
eventually hitting them all and scoring you a 1-Up. Go through the Flippers and
start heading down the path. Two Red Coins are found on the way, and when you
reach the stairs, you'll find three more on the way down. Continue right to
come into a part of the cave filled with Lakitus and enemies. Hit the POW Block
in the center to turn them all into stars. Above the POW Block is a Star Cloud.
Go to the right and bounce off the Large Arrow Ball, but don't go higher than
the small entrance to a tunnel mid-way up the wall. Inside you'll find a Crate
and a "?" Cloud concealing a Flower. Now drop back down to the Arrow Ball and
bounce all the way up and to the left. Here more Wall Lakitus will appear, but
bounce off the Small Arrow Ball to hit another, hidden POW Block. Go to the far
left of this area to find two Red Coins. Now head down the path to the right. A
short ways down you'll see a Switch on some gray dirt. Jump up and hit the
switch to make a warp appear right beneath it. Go in to come to a tall shaft
that contains a long, twisting line of coins you need to collect while falling
down. There are five Red Coins in here. After years of playing this game I've
been able to get all the coins (both red and normal) in one drop, but it'll
probably take you several tries if you haven't played so much, and even if you
have. When you emerge from the area, simply go back and hit the switch again.
Jump after the point where you emerge is an area with a "?" Cloud to the left,
a Flower to the right, and a Koopa. While Nintendo probably wanted you to shoot
the Koopa, thus sending its shell in one of the directions, you can get both by
simply jumping from the dirt where the switch is found over the posts. Go into
the next area, slurp up the first Koopa you see, and immediately spit out the
shell. Follow it and the enemies its hit to watch it sail over a pit and into a
tiny chamber containing a Flower. To the left of the Flower chamber is a pipe
under some stairs. Float under to the pipe to collect the Red Coin on top, then
go inside to find another Red Coin and the Key to the Mini-Game Hut. Warp back
out of the pipe and continue to the left to find the Mini-Game Hut. To the
right is the Middle Ring. Continue on to find another cave (Lakitu Cave 2).
There are two Red Coins near the entrance. Go into the main section of the cave
and slowly make your way down, collecting the three Red Coins along the way. At
the bottom of the cave is a Star Cloud. Directly to the right is a pit of
spikes, and to the right, a Flower. To get to the Flower, you'll have to hover
over the spikes to the ledge near the end. With the low ceiling, this may look
impossible, but it's quite doable. Now continue to the right to find a few
Arrow Clouds. One po

-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 * Star Cloud: Look for this above the first POW Block.
 * Crate: Found in a small tunnel after the first Large Arrow Ball. Bounce up
  halfway and go into the tunnel midway up the left wall to find this.
 * Middle Ring: Found right after the Mini-Game Hut.
 * Star Cloud: This is found at the bottom of Lakitu Cave 2.
~Red Coins:
 * 2 Red Coin: Follow the path at the beginning of the cave and you'll come
  across two Red Coins.
 * 3 Red Coins: On the first set of stairs you come to, there will be three Red
  Coins.
 * 2 Red Coins: To the far left of the area with the second, hidden POW Block
  (right above the first POW Block area).
 * 5 Red Coins: These are in the tall shaft you go to by hitting the Switch.
 * 1 Red Coin: This is above the pipe to the left of the Mini-Game Hut, under a
  small section of stairs.
 * 1 Red Coin: Go into the pipe mentioned above to find a Flying Shy Guy with
  another Red Coin.
 * 2 Red Coins: Found at the entrance to Lakitu Cave 2 (where the bats fly
  down).
 * 3 Red Coins: In the main part of Lakitu Cave 2.
 * 1 Red Coin: Shoot the Arrow Cloud near the end when the one near the coin is
  pointing to the upper left to get the final Red Coin.
~Flowers
 * Flower 1: Found in a small tunnel after the first Large Arrow Ball. Bounce
up
  halfway and go into the tunnel midway up the left wall to find this.
 * Flower 2: Look for this in a posted-off area after the switch. You can get
to
  it by jumping from the dirt the switch is on over the posts.
 * Flower 3: In a tiny chamber under the Mini-Game Hut. Spit a shell from the
  start of the area to have it sail in and collect the Flower.
 * Flower 4: Float under the low ceiling above the spikes in Lakitu Cave 2 to
  reach the fourth Flower.
 * Flower 5: Shoot the Arrow Cloud near the end when the one near the Flower is
  pointing to the upper left to get the final Flower.


-1-Up Locations-
 *If you start the Level out by going down the far left pipe, you'll have a
  chance to get a 1-Up. An Arrow Cloud is waiting below. Wait for the arrow to
  point up and left before shooting an egg at it. It will hit the Koopa and
  shoot its shell, eventually hitting them all and scoring you a 1-Up.
 *Jump from the dirt that the switch is on and over the posts into a place
where
  a Koopa patrols. The left "?" Cloud contain a 1-Up.

~ LEVEL 4-3: DON'T LOOK BACK! ~
Type: Sky              Difficulty: Medium Hard    Yoshi Color: Blue
No. of Coins: Varies   No. of Stars: 26           No. of "?" Clouds: 4
Enemies: Flying Shy Guy, Cactus Piranha Plant, Koopa, Para-Koopa, Toadie,
   Shy Guy, Balloon Boo
Mini-Games: None
Transformations: Helicopter

-Level Layout-

Rising Balloon Area ---> Teetering Log Area ---> Upward Climb --->
Cloud Path ---> Giant Balloon Area/Ground Area ---> Goal


-Level Walkthrough-
This level features balloons, balloons, and more balloons. When you start off,
you'll be near a series of Timed Platforms with balloons that float upward. Hop
on one of the Balloons that rises near the start of the pit to a small platform
on the left wall above. A Flying Shy Guy will drop by with a Red Coin. Head
right and you'll find four more Red Coins right near the top. At the very right
you'll spot a Flower under the platform. Float down to it then hitch a ride
back up on a balloon. Continue on to the right to come across a few Teetering
Logs. To the left of the first is a Red Coin, and above the second log are two
more. After the third log is a pipe going up into a Helicopter transformation
area. Break open the "?" Cloud to unveil the transformation, then take it up to
the top to collect the three Red Coins above the Cactus Piranha Plant, as well
as activate the Middle Ring. Go back down the pipe and ascend the Timed
Platforms. To the left of one is a Red Coin. At the very top of these is a
Flower. Jump to the right of where you find the Flower to get to a platform
with three eggs. A Flying Shy Guy will swoop down here with a Red Coin. Go to
the right and the climb will continue upward. Quickly jump behind the first
Cactus Piranha Plant and snag the Red Coin from the Flying Shy Guy. Up a little
ways is a switch. Hit it and follow the blocks it makes all the way to the left
to find a Flower. Jump to the right to collect a Red Coin and to find a Star
Tulip. To the right is another Cactus Piranha Plant. Defeat it then go behind
it to find a Flower in the air. Shoot an egg to collect it. Now go on to the
next area (where a Middle Ring greets you). This place splits into two paths:
one that goes above, and one below. If you fall down from above, you will end
up below. To get a 100, you'll need to take the upper path, but following the
lower path will yield you a Crate, a Star Cloud, a ton of Coins, and several
chances for 1-Ups. To travel the upper path, shoot the dirt holding up the
Large Arrow Ball at the beginning of this area. Bounce up to get to the top.
Blow up the balloon by jumping/stomping on the... um... balloon blowing-up
thingie. When the balloon is at full size (you won't be able to blow it up any
more), jump on top and let it take you for a ride across the sky. Try to
collect the coins along the way, but don't risk falling for any as none are
red. About halfway through the trip you'll come across a Flower. When the end
is coming up a 1-Up will come near. At the very end there is a small line of
five Red Coins. Jump to the ledge at the end. Here three Shy Guys with 1-Ups
will float down. The goal is just to the right.


-Item Locations-
~Stars:
 * Middle Ring: Look for this above the Cactus Piranha Plant in the Helicopter
  transformation area.
 * Star Tulip: This is to the right of Flower 3, at the top of the blocks
formed
  by the switch.
 * Middle Ring: A Middle Ring is located at the start of the final area (where
  the paths split).
 * Crate: This is found on the lower path near the end. Several balloons are
  carrying it.
 * Star Cloud: Also found on the lower path near the end of the level.
~Red Coins:
 * 1 Red Coin: Float up from the beginning on a balloon to the small platform
on
  the far left. A Flying Shy Guy will drop by with a Red Coin.
 * 4 Red Coins: To the right of the first Red Coin, nearly horizontal to the
  platforms, are four more Red Coins.
 * 1 Red Coin: To the left of the first Teetering Log.
 * 2 Red Coins: Found above the second Teetering Log.
 * 3 Red Coins: Look for these above the Cactus Piranha Plant in the Helicopter
  transformation area.
 * 1 Red Coin: Look to the left of the first set of Timed Platforms.
 * 1 Red Coin: Jump to the right of where the second Flower is found to see a
  Flying Shy Guy with a Red Coin in tow.
 * 1 Red Coin: A Flying Shy Guy behind the Cactus Piranha Plant past the large
  Koopa group carries a Red Coin.
 * 1 Red Coin: Jump to the right of where you get Flower 3 to find a Red Coin.
 * 5 Red Coins: These are found at the end of the horizontal balloon flight.
~Flowers:
 * Flower 1: To the right of the Rising Balloon area, near the top, you'll find
  the first Flower. Either float down from above or take a Balloon up to it.
 * Flower 2: At the very top of the set of Timed Platforms in the Upward Climb
  is a Flower.
 * Flower 3: Break open the "?" Cloud that's to the far left of the blocks made
  by the switch to uncover the third Flower.
 * Flower 4: This is behind the third Cactus Piranha Plant in the level, right
  before the next area. Shoot an egg to get it.
 * Flower 5: This is found at the end of the horizontal balloon flight.


-1-Up Locations-
 *After the second Flower, you'll come across a large grouping of Koopas. Hit
  the stationary shell with an egg and watch it go to the right. Jump on top of
  the Para-Troopa to make it lose its wings (if you didn't hit it with the
  shell). The shell will rebound and come back, hitting the rest of the Koopas
  and scoring you a 1-Up.
 *If you make it all the way to the Goal riding the balloon, you'll be rewarded
  by three 1-Up-carrying Flying Shy Guys.

    This last section, Miscellaneous, is also known as Additional Information,
as that's what you'll be getting here. Section A includes extra tips that will
help you throughout the game. Section B features secrets such as the 2-Player
Mode and a trick to get infinite 1-Ups. Section C lists questions that are
frequently presented to me. Section D is the Contact Info section, which you
should read before sending me any e-mail. Section E includes Credits, Special
Thanks, and a hint of what's to come, while Section F says goodbye with a
Closing Statement.

_______________________________________________________________________

   - - - - - - - - - - - - ADDITIONAL TIPS - - - - - - - - - - - -

   Here are a few helpful tips that you can use throughout the game.

1. Use Enemies as Eggs: Enemies, when spit out of Yoshi's mouth, provide 
pretty much the same functions than an egg has. They can burst open "?" Clouds,
activate a Tulip Flower, or collect out-of-reach Flowers. Then can't shoot
through dirt or grab coins, but they're helpful nonetheless. Keep an enemy in
your mouth as a seventh egg or to help conserve your egg supply.

2. Bounce Eggs for Rewards: When an egg bounces off a wall, it upgrades a color
(green to yellow, yellow to red). An upgraded egg will shoot out coins when it
breaks (comes into contact with an enemy), or in some cases, stars. If you have
green eggs, bouncing the egg off two walls will increase its color and get you
more stuff.

3. Flutter Jump: Although it doesn't look like it, the Flutter Jump actually
gives you a little extra height. In many situations, an item (usually a Flower)
is barely out of reach from a jump. With a Flutter Jump, you can usually reach
it.

4. Bring Baby Mario Closer: When Yoshi gets hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will
many times fly far away, sometimes even out of reach of Yoshi's tongue. In
these cases, you can throw an Egg at Baby Mario's bubble to bring it closer.

       - - - - - - - - - - - - SECRETS - - - - - - - - - - - -

   Ha ha! Here are some ultra-top-secret-super-classified secrets from Yoshi's
Island that'll get you everything you want out of the game.

1. Play Mini-Games (Including 2-Player!)
This is the biggest secret in the game, one that allows you to play any of the
Mini-Games anytime, and also play Throw Balloons (4) and the Watermelon Seed
Spitting Contest in 2-Player. If you'd like to find out how to get this secret
through the game, go to Level 5-4. Head into the door to the left of the start
of the level. Inside is a Chain Chomp, the only one in the game. Pause the game
and use the "?" Cloud item, and a door will appear on the left side of the
room. Enter and a face block will tell you what to do. If you're too lazy to do
all that, you can enter the following code anytime, regardless of whether or
not you've visited the Chain Chomp or even 5-4. On the World Map screen, simply
hold Select and press X, X, Y, B, and A. The Mini-Game screen will pop up, and
you can choose whatever you want to play.

2. Infinite 1-Ups: Level 4-1
There are several situations in the game where you can get a bunch of 1-Ups,
but the easiest and most profitable is the 1-Up trick in Level 4-1. Enter the
level, and proceed to the area where the Shy Guys pop out of the pipe. Kill the
Piranha Plant on the pipe to the right, then grab a Koopa Troopa with your
tongue. Stand on the right pipe and shoot an egg. Now spit the shell into the
area between the pipes, where it'll bounce back and forth between the pipes.
The Shy Guys will continually jump out, each producing a higher tone when
defeated until you get a 1-Up. But wait, each Shy Guy hit after this will yield
another 1-Up, leading to infinite 1-Ups.

3. Infinite 1-Ups: Level 1-7
This is another great 1-Up trick, because it's easy and comes sooner in the
game than the one in level 4-1. To begin the 1-Up process, slurp up a Rolly Bug
then head toward where the Middle Ring is (be sure to have less than six eggs).
Go stand on the enemy pipe just tot he left of the Middle Ring and spit the
Rolly Bug against the wall. It'll bounce of of it, jam against you, and stop.
Next, jump off the pipe and move far enough away so that enemies can emerge.
The Rolly Bug will try to come towards you, and in doing so will smash the
enemies that jump out of the pipe. Just like a turtle shell, after a while
you'll start getting 1-Ups for this.

c'mon!*

    Even though there was Mario World, the Donkey Kong Country Series, Final
Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger, and Mario RPG, Yoshi's Island is still probably my
favorite game from the SNES era. It's just so incredibly fun, challenging, and
it never gets boring. I love playing it over and over again, and hope that
every else will too with the help of this FAQ. I'll leave you with this:
Dangit, Nintendo, why'd you have to change the Yoshi's into the little kiddie
wusses they are in Yoshi's Story (no, they weren't kiddie wusses in Yoshi's
Island... wanna fight about it?)? Oh well, there's always hope in the future.
