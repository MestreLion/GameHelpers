Acolyte/Long-Box Trading (Station III)
--------------------------------------
Main status for story development seems to be Station III: Trading in Long Boxes
Earning the Acolyte's Favour gives more options in the story (I guess)
Deliver a Long-Box to the Acolyte, gain Favour without consuming SAY
	= +2 x Earning the Acolyte's Favour
Errands basically increase Acolyte's Favour consuming SAY
	Guarding the yard: +3 x Favour regardless of outcome, success trigger event that can get rewards
	A present:         +3 x Favour, -200 x Fragment (bad choice)
	A visit to Soothe: +3 x Favour
	A novel present:   +5 x Favour on success. The best option
Questions for the Acolyte develop the story. Only 2 questions allowed (I guess)
	The higher the Favour, more questions available
Quest advances to final stage when Trading in Long Boxes = 4, ends with 9
Goal: Favours >= 25
Roughly 2 outcomes [needs investigation]
	Discourage to perform the autopsy, succeed, picnic: +5 Hearts
	Help with autopsy, Lie about sister, succeed, offer real comfort: +2 Hearts, +1 Secret, +1 Dream of Red
Heartmetal Smith does not seem related, nor gives any reward besides Fragments


Adam's Way
----------
4 Actions
Assist at an Aminescence Hospital
	Root out Poet (SAY) => +1 x Romantic Literature
	Assist in the cloiters => +2 x Supply
	Carry water => +1 x Zee-ztory, +1 x Memory, +1 x Tales, +1 x Vision
	               +2 x Terror

Attend Funeral Feast (evening, SAY)

Exibition
	Attend the Cabinet of Curiosities => +1 x Vision of the Surface, +50 x Fragment / ?


Blind Bruiser - London
----------------------
Regular quest:
	Brilliant Souls to Mt Palmerston
	Afterwards, $1000 to buy Brilliant Souls somewhere and bring back to London.

Alternate Quests:
	Can only be done once per captain, and finishing them locks all Blind Bruiser content for the rest of that captain's run.
	A - Search for the Last Constable hiding away from London
	B - Search for medicine for the Cheery Man


Pigmote Isle - Rats vs Cavies
-------------------------------
Side with Cavies (Seneschal), as final prize (scintillack/banket) is worth more than repairs

Before war, keep trying to steal with Veils or Iron challenge until succeed.
	Penalty for each failure is +5 x Terror
	Veils challenge yield better reward, highest Civilization

Iron Challenge
Rats	?
Pigs	+4 x Scintillack, Might=5, Spirit=3, Civilization=4

Veils Challenge
Rats	+10 x Fuel, +4 x Bale of Parabola-Linen, +1 x Scintillack, ?
Pigs	+10 x Fuel, Might=4, Spirit=3, Civilization=5

I had nothing to offer but my advice
Rats	Spirit=3, others 2,2
Pigs	Might =3, others 2,2

Mascot
Rats	+2 Veils, -1 Civilization
Pigs	+2 Pages

Make Peace right away
Rats	60% chance
Pigs	40% Chance, Spirit=6

Smuggling Fuel is usually worth it.

Rise of the Pigmote Isle
Rats	Request repairs,      -175+10*(Pigmote Isle: Civilisation) x Echo
Pigs	Purchase scintillack, -155+10*(Pigmote Isle: Civilisation) x Echo

Pigmote Isle, A Dilemma on
--------------------------

Hunger will increase every 10 seconds by half of your crew size rounded to the nearest even number if fractional.
So 7 crew = +4h, but 5 = +2h! :O
 1 0
 2 1
 3 2
 4 2
 5 2
 6 3
 7 4
 8 4
 9 4
10 5
Sweet spot: 9 Crew = +4h, same as 7 crew
Not counting overflow hunger bonus (when gets over 50 before resetting)

Lamp uses 1% of fuel per second, every lamp, every boat.
Full Power ('F') eats fuel at a 100% markup (2x quicker) for only a 1.75x increase in speed.
Half vs Full throttle (speed 1 and 2, not 'F') have a linear relationship.
Half throttle uses 0.05% of the engine power in fuel per second and Full throttle uses 0.1%.
So an engine with 1000 Power uses 1% of fuel per second. 2% with the lamp on.

Starting engine power: 800, so 0.8%F/s
(the lamp costs more than the fuel!)

MISC

Curses
---------
- Salt: 	Kill your family (lose Scion!) when return to London. Get to Whiter first!
- Winter:	Bad wheater
- Stone:	(no one knows)
	only known way to get is Frostfound last chamber, once per game. 50% chance (the other outcome is Salt's Curse)


BUGS (old)
----------
- Pigmote Isle: No "Blemmingans: Abroad" += 1 after release
- Empire of Hands: No "A Particularly Potent Poison" = 0 after poisoning pirates nor after completing Zeppelin "145470 - Hero of the Wildweald Court!"
- Empire of Hands: No "Frozen drop of Red Honey" = 0 after Emperor Vault
- "Urbane Magician" listed as Curiosity Cargo
- "Supremacy: London" can be lowered after reaching 10 in Port Carnelian (exploitable to get multiple "London in Glory")
- "Supremacy: Dawn Machine" can achieve 10 even after "Supremacy: London" is 10 (intentional?)
- "Memoirs:  The Lessons of the Chapel" listed as curiosity cargo instead of Memoirs journal section
- Mansion can have 17 Heilooms, not 16
- It is possible to get "The New Sequence" (ie, "Supremacy: The Dawn Machine = 10") even when "Supremacy: London" already >= 10
- lesser drydock repair ($70) can *decrease* your Hull if >= 405
- Test the Cigar: never yields Secrets, as max Flavours = 150, so 150 / 299 = 0.5 = 0
