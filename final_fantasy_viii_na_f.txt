I'll start the walkthrough first, and skip all the crap like character
and villain introductions because who really cares about the characters
in the walkthrough?? If you want characters check a character guide or
something like that. I'm also writing this in a different format from my
other faqs, in kind of a like step by step format, I will mention Boss
tips, and what magics should be junctioned. As always as in all my faqs,
ill try to keep this faq 99.9% spoiler free.

KrOnOs1234@aol.com
Q1-What is FF8?
A1-FF8 is a continuation of one of the greatest rpg series ever. The
final fantasy series made by Squaresoft. The series does not follow a
set pattern, and each Final fantasy game has a different set of
characters, and a different story than the one preceding it. The series
started with the first 3 final fantasy games on the Nes, and the next 3
games on the Snes. FF3(6j),and FF2(4j) are the ones that have been
released in the US for the Snes, and recently FF5, and FF6 were
realeased on the Playstation as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology set.

Q2-Can I still get any Gf's I missed in Discs 1-3 in Disc 4?
A2-Upon defeating the first boss you can unlock the draw command. After
that you can draw some GF's from the bosses there.
Siren=Tri Point
Leviathan=Trauma
Pandemona=Red Giant
Carbuncle=Krysta
Cerebrus=Gargantua
Alexander=Catoblepas
Eden=Tiamat

Q3-Can I still get Lionheart, or buy items in Disc 4?
A3-Tonberry King has an ability called Junk Shop which allows you to get
weapons in Disc 4. It also has an ability which lets you buy items in
Disc 4.

| let Squall die, and the use a Phoenix Down on him so  |
| his HP is still low, and hope he does not die, so you |
| can use his limit break for 250-500 damage to this    |
| bastard. If anyones HP drops below 130 heal him with  |
| Selphie unless you want a limit break. MAKE SURE TO   |
| DRAW THE GF SIREN FROM ELVORET DONT FORGET THIS IS    |

| Use Thunder magic and normal attacks until this dude  |
| falls over, then use the R2+L2 buttons to run away.   |
| It is possible to defeat this guy for 50AP, and the   |
| pride of defeating this guy. To do this you must have |
| a high affection with Quatezocl, have learned the Sum |
| Mag +10%, and Summon Magic +20%, but even so it is    |
| still not worth all the trouble to win 50AP.          |
 -------------------------------------------------------
-In the downward mountain path, walk so the boss does not mess you up
-On the bridge, when it jumps before you, then run back away from the

-To raise your seed ranking you need to do good deeds for Seed, and you
 will be rewarded with a Seed level raise, or you can take tests to
 raise your level. Tests can be taken at the tutorial menu under the
 heading of TESTS. You can only take as many tests as Squall's level.
 That is if Squall is level 11, then you may take the tests up to
 level 11. The higher your Seed level is, the more money you will
 recieve every half an hour or so

 so and you will meet, and name Rinoa, the girl that you danced with
 in the Balamb Garden ball

| Rinoa walks around the bar will slowly fill up. When you    |
| hear a sound while walking around, this means that the new  |
| trick has been learned and you should highlight a new one.  |

-The plan consists of seven steps
Step 1:Catch up to the 2nd escort car
Step 2:Proceed across the roof of the 2nd car
Step 3:Proceed across the roof of the president's car
Step 4:Uncouple the 1st car
Step 5:Have the dummy car hook up with the escort car
Step 6:Uncouple the 2nd car
Step 7:Escape with the president's car
In-Depth Plan Walkthrough
Step 1:Just follow Rinoa to the next car
Step 2:The 2nd car is supposed to have some tight security but you
       will soon find out that their security system is busted so
       just run across the roof of that car
Step 3:Just run across again
Step 4:Selphie and Zell will look out for the soldiers, when they
       yell make sure to pull yourselves up or you'll have to start
       over. Rinoa will yell the codes to you and you have to insert
       them in quickly in 5 seconds or so
Step 5:The guys back at the base will handle this, and you'll get to
       see another FMV
Step 6:Zell and Selphie can't look out for you this time, so after
       about every two codes are inserted by Squall, use R1 or R2
       to check if they are coming. If they are then just pull
       yourself up and then come down and finish inserting the codes
Step 7:If you inserted all the codes correctly, then you will see
       another FMV
-If you do the entire process without failing, you will gain a Seed
 Level
-After all of this you will wind up in the President's car
-Save your game on the Save Point
-Junction some magic and GF to your characters and head through
 the door
-Turns out the president is a fake, and you have to fight that
 bastard

| higher your Magic power is, then the more magic you will be able    |

-After the battle Sacred will run away
-Your goal now is two-fold
-Be aware that it is very confusing making your way around the maze so
 try not to get lost. The enemies here give good rewards, and aren't
 too hard, so spend some time here to draw some magic from the Buel's,
 Armadodo's, and Blobra's around the Tomb. Check the creature list
 for more info on these enemies
-The blobra changes its magic weakness with each fight, so have each
 character cast a different element of magic on the Blobra, and you
 will kill it in one hit
-Head to the floodgate, and open it, then head over to the drawbridge
 and lower it. A new path will now open near the middle. Go back to the
 entrance, and head straight north to reach a room. It's best to save
 before going in, because a pretty tough fight awaits. Also make sure
 to have some Float,life,and healing magic
-When your reach the center, you will find the big brother, and he'll
 call his smaller, but stronger brother.

| Make sure to have one of your characters draws Carbuncle from       |

| are very easy to defeat since they have a very low Hp. Use Brothers |
| to kill the two Iguions in one hit as long as its powered up enough |
| since the Iguions are weak against Earth magic. Their attack Magma  |
| Breath does lots of damage, and can petrify your characters, and    |
| once both characters are stoned then its game over, so make sure to |
| use some soft items to reverse that effect. You can also draw some  |

| Edea uses alot of magic since she is a sorceress so its best to   |

| some of that magic back onto her. This battle can be lost, and    |
| you also will continue with the story, so don't worry about this  |
| battle too much, just try your hardest, and try to win the 20 Ap  |

-After the battle head back to Balamb Garden and now you can control
 the Balamb Garden
-You can now do some Side quests like Shumi Village, Winhill, and
 Centra Ruins to get some extra kick-ass items that will help you
 in your quest. SEE SIDE QUESTS SECTION FOR WALKTHROUGHS FOR THESE
 SECTIONS AND THEIR LOWDOWN
-After all this you can now head to Trabia Garden, the garden that
 Selphie is from. Trabia garden is on the large continent north
 of Balamb garden. You must pilot the garden to a beach on the
 northern side of the large continent and then take the garden
 by land through the moutains to Trabia garden, which is located
 behind some mountains and can be hard to see

-Find the Weapons Mon Aug which is located five steps south of the
 gargoyle statue in the back at the front gate
-Head to basketball court and you characters will have a weird
 flashback
-During the flashback you must walk around talking to everyone and
 then head to the beach when its available
-After the flashback everyone makes a descision so head back to
 the Balamb Garden
-Fight some time outside of Trabia to fight a monster called Gayla
 which looks like a thundery manta ray. Fight it and it will usually
 drop some Mystery fluid. This teaches Acid to Quistis, and also
 allows you to get the Meltdown magic by using St Mag-RF 1 will
 change into 10 meltdowns. So get 100 for each character and
 junction it to each characters Vitality. The spell also rocks
 because it lowers opponents defense and allows you to do a lot
 more damage. Great for bosses
 ---------------------------
| Attack on Galbadia Garden |
 ---------------------------
-Head to Edea's House which is located to the far south of the Centra
 Continent, in the area called the Cape of Good Hope. You can't get
 in anyways.
-Turn around and just opposite of Edea's House you'll see the Galbadia
 Garden. Save your game, and ride straight into Galbadia Garden
-Form a party and head for the Quad, then after speaking with everyone
 you must head back to the bridge.
-Zell's party should head into the Quad to try to save Rinoa, and
 then head and speak with Squall at the Front gate
-Make sure to change junctions. Its good to junction Death to status
 attack, and Thunder to elemental attack to have an easy time with
 the battles here.
-Head to the 2nd Floor Classroom and fight off the enemy soldiers
 there. They can use some status affecting spells so watch out.
-After all this return to see Dr.Kadowaki and speak with her.
-Head to the 2nd floor observation deck, and battle the Galbadian
 Paratrooper
-Press Look around for another option, and then press the button
 for the emergency exit
-You have 4 controls in the battle. Punch(X),Block(Square),Kick(T).
 Punch is powerful but slow, while kick is faster but less
 powerful. First block and then kick or punch back. After
 blocking a couple of enemy attacks, you can do a Deathblow attack by
 pressing O which is very slow but does huge damage. If you lose
 you can restart with better stats and you won't get game over
 so don't worry.

-You have to clear the ragnarok from those weird little enemies
 and it has to be done in a certain order or they will re-spawn.
 They are all easy to kill by junctioning blind or pain to your
 weapon's status attack but even without them they fall easily.
WIPING OUT THE PESTS
1.First take out the purple one in the Hangar, and head through
  the cargo doors and take a left through the door in the corridor
  before the stupid red one gets to you. You will find the 2nd
  purple one in the next room. Take him out for good.
2.Go back to the room beforehand and take out the 1st red enemy.
  Then head to the hangar where the 1st purple enemy was located
  and climb the stairs to find the 2nd red enemy, and wipe him
  out for good.
3.Go back to the air room and take out the first yellow one located
  there. Then head through all the clear rooms to the passenger deck
  and pass by the idle green enemy. Just pass him by and enter the door
  there to find the 2nd yellow propagator.
4.Then come back outside and eliminate the 1st Green enemy. Then head
  back to the hangar and locate a barely visible door on the right side
  the last one of these guys are in there.
-After defeating them all, head to the passenger deck and ride the
 elevator there up to find the cockpit. Have a seat and enjoy the ride
 back to earth.
-Once back on earth Rinoa will be taken away to be imprisoned
-After some discussion on the ragnarok, head to the Sorceress Memorial,
 and free Rinoa
-Then fly over to Edea's house and follow Angelo to the flower field
 for more story. After Zell interupts(STUPID) head over to esthar and
 speak with the prez. You can win the Squall card from Laguna but
 be aware that he is a great card player so watch out. At that point
 you can either head to Lunatic pandora and continue with the storyline
 or head and level up or do some sidequests. I recommend doing the
 Cactaur Island sidequest first to get the HpUp,StrUP Etc. skills and
 learning all the UP skills on the other GF's(Leviathan,Carbuncle,
 Brothers,Ifrit,Siren) and equip those and level up with them on
 the Islands Closest to heaven and hell. Make sure to have Odin and
 begin each battle by trying to escape and do so unless Oding shows
 up and kills the enemies, which will give you about 3 level ups per
 battle, but the enemies are very tough so don't engage them yourselves
 until you're at a higher level.
-This is also a good time for the Deep Sea research center sidequest.

-First find the fake stone by examining the frog sitting in the pond
 outside the artisan's workshop and take it back to the Sculptor who
 will not accept it. The real one is in the Artisans house.
-Go back to the sculptor and give him all the stones
-Head to the elder's house and get your reward(A PHOENIX PINION!!!!)
 WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
-A one-time use item that is really a summon like Odin, use it once
 and the phoenix will randomly appear when all your characters die and
 resurect them. The phoenix appears very rarely so its kinda useless
-You can stop here but to get the real reward, you must leave and
 re-enter the village
-Head back to the workshop and speak with the elder's attendant who
 doesnt want to work on the statue all by himself
-Go back to the elder's house and speak with the elder to try and get
 more assistance for the attendant.
-After speaking with him head outside and talk with the Moomba thats
 now there. Follow him to the workshop and listen on the conversation
 between the attendant and the Moomba
-Speak with the attendant and then return to the elder's house and talk
 to the elder again
-AGAIN return to the attendant and talk to him, he now thinks that the
 artisan should also help
-Go the artisan's house and speak with him. He's a lazy bum and doesn't
 want to lend a hand
-Speak with the elder and realize that if you want the artisan to help
 you're going to have to bribe him if you want his help
-To do this you must travel to Fisherman's Horizon and retrieve a
 grease monkey for the artisan. The grease monkey is located in the
 back where you fought the boss. In the repair shop near the train
 station. Speak with the monkey, to recieve a Moomba doll and then go
 back to Shumi village
-Go to the artisans house and give him the Moomba doll. After all this
 aren't you ready to recieve your reward??
-Head to the elder's house and speak with the elder to recieve your
 reward, a Status Guard
-The status guard is a good rare item that teaches a lucky GF the
 St-Def*4 ability which allows one of your characters to junction
 4 types of magic to your status defense which can leave him almost
 invincible to status effects

| Drain(Courtyard-Hidden)   |
| Aero(Side of the Tower)   |
| Pain(Top of Tower-Hidden) |
 ---------------------------
-To get to Centra Ruins, head to the Centra crater, and find the tower
 not far of the coast. Save and enter
-You will have twenty minutes to complete your quest to get Odin and
 since you will be pestered with enemy encounters from some tough
 enemies, its best to equip Diablos Enc-None ability to stay away from
 any battles, since the enemies here also have large amounts of HP, and
 the battles can take a long time
-Junction to Magic, and strength
-Follow the staircases until you reach an altar which is really an
 elevator. After riding the elevator you will come to two staircases.
 The right one leads to an Aero draw point, and the left one leads to
 a room full of machines. Climb the left ladder and flip the switch
 inside and then climb back down. You'll notice that the altar in front
 of the elevator is lit so examine it and a new staircase will appear
 to the right.
-Follow the stairs to the tomb to a large demon statue with one red eye
 Climb the ladder on the left and take the eye from the statue and then
 climb up the stairs on the right to get to the top of the tower. Head
 to the left and climb the dome to find another statue with a red eye.
 Place the eye in the left eye of the statue and you will recieve a
 code so write it down. The code is always random. Take both eyes out
 the statue and head back down to the other statue and place both eyes
 there. A place to input the code will appear, so input the code that
 you got from the other statue by using the directional buttons, and a
 path will appear below the statue.
-Head through the door making sure you have magic junctioned to MAGIC,
 most importantly, and then strength.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-After the battle Odin will join you NOT as a GF but as a GF that only
 appears at certain times during battles, and kills all regular enemies
 To increase the chances of Odin appearing raise your Luck stat.
-You can participate in the side quest to get Tonberry King but its
 best to wait a bit later than disc 2 when you're more powerful, but
 here's the way to get it anyways
-First before the battle I suggest that you have some Meltdown magic,
 and Aura magic(You can get Aura from Island Closest To heaven) from
 the secret draw points there, plus some Curaga, or Full-Life magic
 junctioned to HP, and meltdown magic junctioned to Vitality
-Now start fighting regular Tonberry enemies in the courtyard of the
 ruins. They can be tough, so junction Triple to Strength if you're
 doing this early in the game. They can deal 2000+ damage to your
 characters and their Everyone's Grudge attack is based on how
 many enemies you've killed during the game. The Tonberry moves
 closer and closer each turn and if you don't defeat it fast enough
 then it'll come close and use the Chef's Knife attack which can deal
 3000+ damage to one character.
-Cast meltdown on them and defeat them with regular attacks
-After defeating about 20 Tonberry enemies, the Tonberry King will
 appear right after defeating a Tonberry. You can always leave and
 save and the re-enter during the fights against the Tonberry
 enemies
-Tonberry KING is hard with ALOT of HP with strong attacks so be
 prepared

| Chocobo Forest |
 ----------------
-When you first enter your first Chocobo Forest, Chocoboy will give
 you a ChocoWhis for free, and then charge you 1000G to teach you
 how to use it. The ChocoWhis locates the baby chocobos, called
 Chicobos in these forests. The ChocoWhis has two modes, a
 ChocoSonar, and ChocoZiner. ChocoSonar locates the Chicobos. The
 ChocoWhis will give of a little ping as you search the forests, and
 change into a fast-pitched louder ping when you're on the right
 spot where the chicobos are. After locating the spot, change over
 to ChocoZiner, blowing it will cause a Chicobo to appear, or go
 and hide if you're on the right spot. If youre not on the right
 spot then a chicobo will come down and steal your ChocoWhis and
 you'll be forced to buy a new one from Chocoboy
-Here is a list of items that you can buy from Chocoboy
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chocoboy's Clue:Be careful where the Sonar reacts
Solution:Start of by using the Choco Ziner at spot 1 or 2 to get both
Chicobos back in the trees.Then use the ChocoZiner at spot 3 which will
bring down all three Chicobos in this area. Head to spot4 and use the
ChocoZiner to bring down the last Chicobo. Return to spot 1 or 2 and use
the ChocoZiner for the last time to return the 3 Chicobos at the top
back to the trees. Speak with the remaining Chicobo to solve the
puzzle.Don't Forget to find the hidden items:Shell Stone, and Holy Stone
located at the I on the map.

OBJECTIVE
=========
This is against everything you've been taught in RPG college or years
of your personal experience but.. In FFVIII, you want to fight as
LITTLE as possible, which translates into NOT gaining levels. Before
you send me hate mails please listen to my explanation.

You might (or might not) have noticed that the enemies in FFVIII
takes the SaGa turn so that they level up as you do. You'll almost
never run into exceptionally weak enemies. As enemies level up, they
gain new attacks, new spells (and increase their Draw list too) and
gains higher stats. However, the enemies gains stats a LOT faster
than you do (ie, a level or two doesn't make too much difference in
terms of power) so you'll find yourself weaker and weaker and the
enemies stronger and stronger as you progress through the game. And
by the time you get to the bonus bosses like Ultima and Omega
Weapons, your stats might be way too low to even think of challenging
them, or they'll mop the floor with you!

You may object and say that there are always Junctions to rely on.
Yes you're right, Junctions are very important in this game BUT
Junctions can only do so much. For example, Ultima is the best spell
to junction to most of your stats. Even with 100 Ultimas, you'll only
be able to raise your Strength by 100 points while the maximum is
255. There are Character Abilities though, like Str +60% that can
bring your Strength up to 255 without too much problem, but you can
only equip up to 4 Character Abilities max (and it's extremely rare
too.) You'll have a few problems with this. One is that Str +60% is
extremely rare, so you'll have to stick to Str +40% most of the time
(which may or may not bring your Str up to 255) but the other problem
is more serious. There are about 6 very important stats that you need
(HP, Str, Vit, Mag, Spr and Spd) but you can only equip 3 or 4 stat
boosts, and since your other stats are so low, you'll have a hard
time getting high values in every category. Not to mention the times
when you need to equip another more important Character/Party Ability
like Mug, Move-Find or Rare Item.

I hope everyone understands this idea.

Sure, how do you get high stats without fighting enemies? Well, I
don't know if you had noticed but you can teach certain GFs "Bonus"
abilities. These include HP, Str, Vit, Mag and Spr. How does these
skills work? When you equip one of these and you gain a level, the
respective stat will be boosted by 1 point, on top of any regular
stats boosts you might get at level up (except for HP Bonus, which
gives you an extra 30HP.) Like I've said, a couple of levels don't
differ to much since the game is way to stingy at regular stats
boosts at level up. You'll gain about 80 or so HP and 1 point of
Str/Vit/Mag etc.. once every 2-5 levels! (Some other stats are even
rarer, such as Speed or Luck.) What difference does one point make?
Not much, but if you start equipping the Bonus abilities at LV20 and
power yourself up to LV100, that's gonna make an 80 point difference!
Wow! That's almost another 100 Ultimas!

However, you'll only have access to these abilities quite a bit into
the game, and have to get to Disc 3 to utilize these abilities to the
max. So you'll want to keep your levels as low as possible, then
power up to maximum level for maximum stats bonus!


WHY BOTHER?
===========
Well, to tell you the truth, this is not something I'd recommend that
you'd do everyday since it can get quite tedious, especially if this
is your first game. However, getting all the boosts in your stats
makes the optional bosses a whole lot easier. Getting high stats
might be a joy in it itself, to laugh at the boss' spells as if
they're insect bites or killing them in 2 rounds.


WHERE DO I START?
=================
There are a few ways or getting rid of encounters or not gaining
experience. Every point of EXP counts, remember that!

1) Running away
Possibly the easiest option, running away is easy to do and you won't
get any experience. However, if you plan to run away, make sure that
you DON'T do any sort of damage to the enemies, since the run system
in FFVIII has been improved so that you'll gain partial experience if
you've done some damage to the enemies.

Earlier in the game in your test missions (Fire Cavern and Dollet),
running away is hazardous since it will cause a deduction in your
points every time you run away, meaning you'll likely to get a low
SeeD rank. However, this is a loose-loose situation where you have to
choose either stats or SeeD rank (which translates into money.) I'd
choose stats and run away since money isn't all that important, as
you don't have to buy very many stuff. To make up for it, you can do
a few things that gives you more points.
  - Choose the 10 minute interval in Fire Cavern. The Fire cavern is
pretty straight forward and you only need about 2-3 minutes to fight
Ifrit. I did it with just less than 6 minutes left on the clock!
(This is why I recommend that you play through the game normally
first.)
  - Do NOT talk to anyone except your own team. Otherwise you'll get
points deducted.
  - KILL the X-ATM092 boss (the giant robotic spider.) Remember, you
cannot kill it the first time around. (Its HP will be refilled when
you deplete it to zero.) So weaken it first, run, then fight it
again. Refer to the walkthrough if you want more information.
Defeating it will result in 100 bonus points (I think.)

NEW!! Actually, I've found a way better Dollet strategy not only lets
you gain ZERO EXP, but also allow you to power up your GF and gain
tons of AP. Anyway, kill off Squall and Zell (so they won't gain any
EXP) and fight all the battles with Seifer. Your GFs will level up
faster than he does and you'll gain lotsa AP!! Fight here as much as
you wish. What's even better is that fighting heaps of enemies here
will actually boost your points in the "Attack" category. (I gained
no points in the game where I ran away from everything but I gained
the full 100 when I fought them with Seifer.)

These steps are described in detail in the walkthrough.

The disadvantage of running away is that you won't be able to gain
any AP that are vital to the GFs. And you won't be able to get any
items dropped by the enemies either.

2) Card them
You can learn the unique Card command from your first GF, Quezacotl.
This is an extremely useful command to use when you have to fight.
The advantage of this is that you WILL get the AP AND can pick up
dropped items from enemies, and you will NOT gain any EXP! What's
even better is that you'll get an extra card which can be changed
into items via Quezacotl's Card Mod ability. The disadvantage is, of
course, it's sometimes more fuss than it's worth.

Because of this, choose to learn the Card command first, it's worth
40AP and isn't very hard to learn. (Simply defeating Ifrit will give
you 20AP!) Anyway, you don't really need the Boost skill at that
point in the game so choose Card first, then Boost.

It's not hard carding an enemy though, but like Pokmon, you have to
weaken them first. You should Scan the enemy first to see its current
HP, then predict how many attacks by certain members is enough to
weaken it. It's ideal if an enemy is down to a quarter or less of its
total HP, but you can start successfully carding them at about half
health. The lower the enemy's HP, the more likely you're to succeed.
Do NOT forget to equip the Card command like I do occasionally
though, as you'll leave yourself in a sticky situation. Note it IS
possible to card an enemy when its HP is about or below a half. If
the game gives you a "miss" message and you know it's weakened
enough, use the command again, you'll usually get it the next turn.
(The game likes to trick you at times, to think you have to weaken it
some more while you end up killing it.)

To weaken them you can try a few different ways. I like to use normal
attacks. Squall's attack is the best since as it has the "trigger"
feature, and you can do a weak or a strong attack as you desire. His
attack is also very reliable since it will NEVER do a critical hit
(as you can use the trigger to do 150% of damage with every attack
anyway, so he doesn't need one.) so you won't end up killing it with
a critical. Gunblades also never miss (even under "Blind" status)
which is a definite plus.

Also, other member's regular attacks works too. You generally should
not junction spells to your Elemental-Attack since the creature may
be weak against it and you'll do too much damage. I always keep one
member's Strength junction-free to do really weak attacks if I need
it (like against Geezards.)

Spells ain't a bad idea either. GFs are the same. Try to keep a
collection of different spells in stock. Weaker GFs like Siren are
also quite good at this if you need a weak attack. Also, you may or
may not want to use Boost, depending on the situation.

The BEST method I've seen is to use Quistis' Limit Break Micro
Missile. The beauty of Micro Missile is that it's a gravity elemental
attack so it can NEVER kill an enemy. Also, unlike other attacks,
gravity attacks removes a portion of a target's current HP. The
effect of Micro Missile varies though, but it's for the better. It
depends on how serious Quistis or your party's condition is (ie,
party member down, suffering from negative status, low HP) and it can
remove from 50% to 93.75% of its current HP, which makes it
absolutely perfect for carding enemies. Just keep Quistis in critical
(ie, HP is in yellow and she's kneeling down) and use Micro Missile
on the enemies in the beginning of the battle while another character
use the Card command. Keep some Phoenix Downs/Life spells in stock
just in case she dies.

Note: Micro Missile will only work on enemies with 9999HP or less.
The maximum damage it can do is 9999, so against enemies with higher
HP, Quistis has to use it multiple times before the enemy's HP is low
enough. A handful of enemies are resistant towards Gravity attacks,
mainly bosses.

Keep in mind. Some enemies cannot be carded. These included bosses
and human troops.

Sometimes not encountering any enemies is the best option, since the
random encounter can be annoying at times. Diablos offers 2 crucial
abilities and they are Enc-Half and Enc-None. You must learn the
former before the latter becomes available. Enc-Half costs only 30AP
(easy peasy) but Enc-None costs a whopping 100AP! (And it's nothing
compared to the 200AP needed for Mug!) Because of this, it's best to
challenge Diablos as soon as possible (ie, right after receiving the
Magic Lamp from Cid.) He's well worth the effort you put into
fighting him and gets some of the most useful abilities in the game!
And believe me, he's powerless if you know how to fight him!

You'll be able to get Enc-Half easily but Enc-None takes longer. Use
the Card trick above or save the boss' AP for them. Then equip Enc-
None and you'll never have to be bothered with random encounters
again! (Although since you don't fight, you'll earn no AP for all
your GFs, and you'll miss out certain useful abilities such as Mug.
So de-equip the skill occasionally and Card some enemies.)

4) Tonberry
Ok, you will gain some EXP with this method but it's VERY little! You
can use Tonberry's LV Down command to weaken enemies and defeat them
that way. Each LV Down halves their level, keep doing it until their
levels drops to 1, then kill them. You'll gain 1-3 EXP for your team.
This is great for the encounters that you cannot run away from and
cannot be carded. (Such as enemy soldiers in Laguna's scenario.)

Opposed to common believes, Tonberry can be acquired as early as when
you have control of the mobile Balamb Garden in Disc 2!!! You can get
Tonberry right after acquiring Odin. The Tonberry is so cute!

IMPORTANT! Also contradicting to common believes, the requirement for
the Master Tonberry to appear is NOT to kill 20 Tonberries! You need
to have 20 Chef's Knives in your inventory, then the Master Tonberry
will appear! So if you have played lotsa card games, you can exchange
Tonberry/Master Tonberry's cards into them and it'll be a lot less
work! This was confirmed by Happy Matt.

5) Other vehicles
Another way of travelling without encountering anything is to travel
in vehicles (for some reason, all of them are painfully slow!) You
can get access to cars fairly early in the game, but they cost a bit
of money and you have to refuel them at regular intervals. You can
catch trains too, to travel to another city quickly but you don't
seem to be able to catch any trains in the first half of the game
except for story purposes. Balamb Garden is also quite a convenient
vehicle since it can cross the ocean. And last (and the least!) are
Chocobos. You'll only gain access to riding the chocs after Balamb
Garden takes off, so you won't have that much use for it. (The way
you catch a chocobo is also really boring.)

You won't encounter any enemies while travelling in vehicles, but
they're only available on the world map.

6) Terminate your own team members
I don't think the EXP in this game is shared between the characters
so you may want to kill/petrify 2 other members to keep them weak and
fight the battle with only one member. I don't think it's that risky
if you play your cards right. Remove the GF from the other members if
you want.

7) The soul of stone
Thanks to jay sar <vodka_81@yahoo.com> for this trick
So, "jay sar" told me that if you junction Break in your ST-Atk and
petrify an enemy unit with it, you'd get no EXP. Although it doesn't
work as good as it sounds, because when you petrify an enemy, the
game thinks that you've ran away from it and gives you the partial
experience since your attacks will do some damage to them before
petrifying them. Also, it's kinda risky since you may kill the enemy
unit if you did petrify them. However, the problem is solved if you
cast Break straight out of the bottle since it does no damage. The
problem with this method is that it won't give you any AP either!

You can get Breaks easily by refining Cockatrice Pinions and Softs
with Diablos' ST Mag-RF.

Other notes and tips
  - Well, I guess you all know that the character who strikes the
killing blow will get more EXP than the others. This is true however,
nobody seems to get any extra EXP if the enemy is killed by a
summoned GF! So use this to your advantage when you're fighting
enemies when you don't have any other options. It doesn't stop you
from gaining EXP but at least you won't gain any extras.

  - You should know by now that the bosses in FFVIII won't give you
any EXP, which is a pleasant sign, and they (usually) give you a ton
of AP that your GFs sorely needs! Try selecting an expensive ability
before fighting the boss so you won't waste some of its AP.

  - Not fighting enemies will lower your SeeD rank and likewise,
fighting lotsa enemies will raise your SeeD rank. It's likely that
your SeeD ranks will be lowered in the course of the game if you
follow my guide. However, it's again not like if it cannot be
remedied:
* Take sometime out of the game to card some enemies. This will help
you avoid lowered ranks and can beef up your GFs who needs APs. I
actually GAINED a SeeD level when I went on a carding rampage.
* Taking the test! Always take as many tests as you can, to give your
salaries a head start!
* If you choose the shortest time in a timed quest, it's likely that
your SeeD rank will be raised, if you succeed of course! Such as the
Missile Base escape time.
* Doing certain things right will also raise your SeeD rank. I do not
have a list of those events though, but I know Rinoa's train quest is
one of them. Make no mistakes and your rank will be raised!
* One guy on the second floor of Balamb Garden will ask you to show
him how to cast spells. DON'T DO IT!!! Casting spells in the hallways
are forbidden and your rank will be instantly lowered! (I learnt it
the hard way. :-( )

  - GFs WILL gain AP and EXP when junctioned to a dead member, even
though it makes no sense.

  - Spread out your GFs among your characters as equally as possible.
The most important Junction ability early in the game is Mag-J, since
you need it to draw decent spells from bosses. (Quezacotl, Siren and
Diablos will provide you with those.)


Critical Guardian Forces
========================
Now, you will need to keep this up until the point after the space
mission and acquired Ragnarock. Now you need to get your hands on 2
vital GFs, Cactuar (Sabotender) and Bahamut.

Cactuar
On Cactuar's Island of course, with a tiny green thing that pops out
of the sand occasionally. Land Ragnarok there and challenge it, but
don't forget to junction your characters properly first.

Beat it anyway you like (but I'd prefer drawing spells from it
first.) And you'll be able to acquire it as your GF. The best thing
about the Cactuar is that it comes with all 5 of the bonus abilities
LEARNED!! Which saves you time having to learning it from other GFs
(they costs 100AP each and all of them require 2 prerequisite
skills.)

You may start training your characters now, but you need more slots
to equip all the bonus skills, and since you're going to acquire
Bahamut sooner or later (you are, ain't you?) why not do it now?

Bahamut
Head to Deep Sea Research Centre aka Battleship Island, which is not
on the map but you can get there by heading Ragnarock towards the
south-wester corner of the map. Look around and you should find some
structure that looks kinda like an oil refinery. Land the ship on it
(kinda tricky, look for the shadow.) Head towards the doorway and
you'll be in a large room with a glowing cylinder. Choose to stay and
move ONLY when the lights goes out, or you'll be attacked by some
enemies (usually Anacondours, just run.) Look for the ring objects
surrounding the cylinder though, and make sure they disappear
completely before moving. You should be able to take about 3 steps
each time the light goes out.

Move to touch the cylinder and you'll be asked 2 questions. Choose
the first option (can't remember what.) and you'll fight a Ruby
Dragon. They shouldn't be much of a problem anyway since because
you're weak, they'll be weak too. You can't fight this normally
though, since you'll receive about 1200EXP for each member if you
did, bringing you up a level instantly! Just level it down with
Tonberry or card it (I chose the first option.) Beware, because Odin
came and killed it and ruined it for me once so save your game before
attempting this.

You'll be prompted with another set of choices after you win, choose
the second option. (Can't remember what it was.) And you'll be up
against another Ruby Dragon. Just use the same strategy as the first
one.

Then you'll be asked ANOTHER question. Move the curser down and
you'll be able to choose a third option, even though it's nothing!
Choose it and you'll face Bahamut!! Defeat it (not that hard, but you
should spend sometime drawing Full-Life from it) and you'll be able
to get the king of all dragons as your very own pet! It comes with
the as-good-as-it-gets Abilityx4 skill, which allows your character
to equip up to 4 Character/Party Abilities!

We're ready for action!


PREPARING FOR THE BIG THING
===========================
You've got a choice to make now. You've got 5 different bonus
abilities for 5 important stats but you can only equip 4 of them at
once. Anyhow, here's 2 of the best ways I've found.

All round character
This is intended for a balanced character who's good in every
category. Equip:
       * Str Bonus
       * Vit Bonus
       * Mag Bonus
       * Spr Bonus
And ditch HP, since HP is an easy one to Junction it to max. I prefer
this method over the other one though.

Customized character
This works with a character's natural abilities (ie, Limit Breaks) to
determine a character's fighting style, either a fighter or a magic
user. Irvine, Squall and Zell are definite fighters so they should
equip:
       * Str Bonus
       * Vit Bonus
       * Spr Bonus
       * HP Bonus

Ditch magic since they don't really need it for their Limit Breaks.
Selphie however, are the exact opposite, they use magical Limit
Breaks so substitute Mag Bonus for Str Bonus. Rinoa is an odd one
since she has both physical (Angelo) and magical (Angel Wing) Limits
and if you're going to use Rinoa at all, train her with the "All
round" method. Quistis, too, is strange since her Blue Magic works in
various ways so it's better to build her as an all round character.

Anyhow, lets say you start the training at LV20. You'll be able to
gain 2400HP and 80 points of the other stats. However, 2400HP is way
more than you need. From my experience, a LV100 character without HP
Bonus has around 4000HP, while the best spell for junctioning to HP
is Full-Life (Ultima is better, but it's a waste to junction it to HP
since Full-Life does the job nicely.) which gives 4800 boost, which
makes about 8800HP, so you can just gain about 40 levels with HP
Bonus on and swap it for the other attribute that you didn't equip.

As a matter of fact, most characters can get maximum HP without HP
Bonus just by junctioning 100 Ultimas to HP alone. (So they can save
a slot to equip another ability.)

Whatever you do, don't EVER ignore Vitality and Spirit!!! They're
probably the most important attributes to the character (Spirit more
so than Vitality, especially later in the game.) Remember, there are
no armors in this game so these stats are the only defence your
characters have. (And Evade too, which works amazingly well.)

Some notes
There are times where you just HAVE to go up a level no matter what
(such as Laguna's second scenario.) it doesn't really matter too much
but you can gain some partial stats boosts from these. Remember,
Cactuar is not the only GF that offers these bonus abilities, earlier
GFs have them too but they're usually way too expensive or
inconvenient to acquire. However, when you do learn one of the
abilities, equip the GF to the character who's just about to go up a
level and they can gain one bonus point for the respective category.
It's not the best but it's better than nothing. Here's what the other
GFs offer: (All "Bonus" abilities costs 100AP.)

HP Bonus - Brothers
    Prerequisites: HP +40% [120AP], HP +80% [240AP] (!!)
Strength Bonus - Ifrit
    Prerequisites: Str +20% [60AP], Str +40% [120AP]
Vitality Bonus - Carbuncle
    Prerequisites: Vit +20% [60AP], Vit +40% [120AP]
Magic Bonus - Siren
    Prerequisites: Mag +20% [60AP], Mag +40% [120AP]
Spirit Bonus - Leviathan
    Prerequisites: Spr +20% [60AP], Spr +40% [120AP]

The other inconvenience is that you can only equip up to 3 Character
Abilities without Bahamut so you need to power up in Disc 3 to get
maximum effects.

!!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!! ==============================================
|It *IS* damn right possible to get through the first 2 and half  |
|discs WITHOUT going up a SINGLE level, I have done it!!! Anyway, |
|it's not as hard as you think so you really don't need these     |
|abilities. HOWEVER, I was able to find a Rosetta Stone (learns   |
|Abilityx4) in Esthar so you'd want those abilities since you can |
|actually train TWO characters at once!!! Details below.          |
===================================================================

Bonus Rosetta Stone
Ok, I don't know if this is random or what but I've been able to get
a FREE Rosetta Stone from Esthar. You know how sometimes you'll get a
free gift when you visit one of the online shops in Esthar (like how
Johnny's Shop sometimes gives you Mega-G-Potions.) Well, repeatedly
visit Cheryl's Shop (the one that's always closed) and you'll
eventually get a free Rosetta Stone! It took me about 20-30 tries.
According to Adrian Dutkiewicz, you can only get one Rosetta Stone
here.


TRAINING
========
Hopefully, by the time you get Bahamut and Cactuar, your levels are
still relatively low. Here're my character's levels in my first game:
         Squall   LV19            Zell   LV11
         Quistis  LV11            Irvine LV15
         Selphie  LV13            Rinoa  LV16
It is indeed possible to get through the game without gaining a
level, so character's level will remain as they were at the start:
         Squall   LV7             Zell   LV8
         Quistis  LV8             Irvine LV13
         Selphie  LV8             Rinoa  LV11

Anyway, make up your mind on who you want to train first, I
personally recommend either Quistis or Squall. (I prefer Quistis.)
Remove all the GFs from your team members and junction it to the
character you wish to train first, then go to an easy battle and kill
off the remaining party members (they should be a piece of cake,
since they have next to no HP and Vitality.) Now, you need to
junction yourself properly. Make sure you've stocked up on good
spells, and if you don't have enough, just "borrow" your team
member's for a while.

You can train your characters at a number of places. Happy Matt
recommends the area outside Edea's house. You can only train one
character at a time, so remove the GFs from the characters you don't
want to train yet, and killed them off (so they won't gain any EXP.)
Junction Death to your ST-Atk and equip the LV Up command. Get into a
battle and use LV Up to raise the enemy's level to 100, then kill
them off. You should get lotsa EXP and can gain a level per fight.
However, the EXP gained this way is way too little for my taste. I
like to play risky so my choice of training ground is... the Island
Closest to Hell! (ooohh..)

Junctioning your character is very important here, one wrong spell in
the wrong place could mean instant death.

Status Junction                   Elemental Junction
A: Sleep                          A: Blizzarga
D: Confuse                        D: Flare
D: Berserk                        D: Firega
D: Death                          D: Shell
D: Break                          D: Protect

Status is crucial but elemental ain't as important. You can get ST-
Def x4 from Cerberus (if you need AP, fight the Cactuars in the
desert. They give you 20AP each and 1 digit EXP!) or Doomtrain. It's
a must that you have ST-Def x4 as you'll come across Malboros and
Blue Dragons. Malboro's Bad Breath can give you really nasty status
like Confuse, Poison, Berserk, Petrifying, Blind, Silence etc.
Junctioning the above spells will make Bad Breath mildly harmful, the
only negative status that's a pain is Sleep. Just wait 'til it hits
you with its acid attack and use Siren's Treatment command if you
need it. The Blue Dragon however, likes to cast Death and Break
occasionally, killing anyone without protection in one hit. Sleep
won't work against all the enemies though, just the T-Rexaurs,
Grendels and Ruby Dragons.

Elemental isn't that important, but since a number of enemies like
Ruby Dragons, T-Rexaurs and Malboros are weak against ice, Blizzaga
is good for doing extra damage. (No enemies are strong against it
though, which makes it perfect.) You should be protected against Fire
but all the other ones ain't all that important.

None thing of note: Ruby Dragon's Breath is NOT Fire elemental! I
know it because it used Firega on Selphie prior to that and she
absorbed it, then it unleashed Breath and killed my whole team! Be
careful of the Ruby Dragons ok? (Breath does 3000-5000 to the whole
team!)

As for stats junction, just use best fit. Squall should favour Attack
while it doesn't really matter for Quistis, although a high Speed
helps a lot. Make sure you've got good Vitality and Spirits! Junction
Tornado to your Evade, I don't know why but it's really effective!
(It seems to have a higher Evade chance than just 20%.)

As for command, I'd choose Attack, Magic, Draw and Treatment. Oh
yeah, save after every fight! These enemies are really tough and
you're cheating death fighting right in front of them!

Squall
Just use attack on all the enemies, when your HP gets low, finish
them with Renzokuken! Make full use of his trigger, and with a high
speed, you should be able to attack 3 times before they even get a
go. If you need healing FAST, use Curaga, but if it's not really
urgent, don't worry too much about it because you can finish the
enemies easily with Renzokuken. Or you might want to cast Regen.

If you're against enemies that have very high HP (Ruby Dragons in
particular) you may want to cast some Demi first, since it'll do 9999
damage for the first few castings! Don't use it against the T-Rexaur
though, as they're really weak against cold and Sleep, so you'll be
able to finished them easily with just regular attacks, for a lot of
EXP!

If you feel that the enemy's Vitality is too high, you may want to
cast Meltdown (Merton in the Japanese version, which is a MUCH better
name) or summon Doom Train.

Quistis
This is easier done than said. Keep her at critical status (you can
do it easily do exchanging Junctions between another character, then
change back. Make sure she has acquired Degenerator. Now when you get
into battle, immediately use her Blue Magic Degenerator to knock out
the enemy in one hit!! If the triangle doesn't come out, use the
famous "tap tap" easy Limits trick.

You should be able to gain 1-3 levels per fight. I hate those
Grendels since they have very high defence and don't give up enough
EXP for my troubles. The other advantage fighting here is that the
enemies occasionally drops really nifty stuff, such as Energy
Crystals that can be refined into Ultimas or Irvine's Pulse Bullets
and used to upgrade Rinoa and Quistis' best weapons. (I had soooo
many of them in my last game, about 50+!!) If you haven't done so
already, you can gather the 6 Malboro Tentacles required to summon
Doom Train here really easily, defeating them will net you 8 of them.

Other characters
Once Squall/Quistis gets to level 100, and bring another (live)
member into the team and junction Bahamut and Cactuar (and some other
ones) to them and equip the 4 "Bonus" abilities and start the process
again. You're allowed level 100 characters in the team though, as
they won't gain any EXP any more and the game isn't as risky any more
since the level 100 character can revive the weak character if they
die. Repeat until all 6 characters are level 100.

Two characters at once!
You can bring 2 weak members into the fight if you manage to get your
hands on a Rosetta Stone, which can be found in Esthar. Use the
Rosetta Stone on a GF (you may have to use an Amnesia Greens on a GF
to make it forget an ability) and junction Carbuncle, Siren,
Leviathan, Ifrit or Brothers on the same character so you can train 2
characters at once. (I used my Rosetta Stone on Shiva, if you really
want to know, since use's full of crap abilities!)

It basically uses the same strategy as above except it's much safer
since if one character gets KO'd, the other can revive them, lowering
the chance of you getting a Game Over. Anyway, I'd recommend that you
train one "training friendly" characters (Quistis/Squall) and another
not so "training friendly" characters (Selphie/Rinoa.) That way, the
"training friendly" character can do most/all the work while the not
so "training friendly" characters (with bad Limit Breaks) can tag
along and gain levels at the same time. Quistis is exceptionally good
at this!

Oh yeah, junction the GFs that your characters don't need to the dead
member so they can gain EXP faster.


WANT EVEN HIGHER STATS?
=======================
You should have really high stats after the intensive training. (If
you want to see what I got, they're in the character's section.) If
you want even higher stats, it's going to be difficult from now on.
There are a few choices for these too, but none of them are really
efficient/convenient.

1) Steal/Find Sources
Those items that raise certain character's stats are back! (Although
they've been renamed into [something]-Ups.) Some bosses carry them
and can be won/stolen from them.

  - Raijin is the best example of this. You can win/steal Str-Ups
from him during all 3 fights with him in the game. Remember if you
steal, you cannot win anything, if you wanna to win from him you
cannot steal. Sometimes the quantity varies depending on it you
mugged them or won them.

  - There's also a Str-Up in the prison.

  - You can mug 2 Magic-Ups from the left orbs where you fight NORG.
A Spr-Up is available for steal for the right orb.

  - According to EDIelectric@aol.com, you can steal 2 Str-Ups from
the left portion of Mobile Type 8 and 2 Vit-Ups from the right.

Anybody know any other bosses that drop or carry these wonderful
Sources? Please e-mail me if you do.

2) Make Source
This is easier said than done. Doomtrain's Forbid Med-RF ability can
turn some items into stats boosting Sources. Here's all of them:
         1x  Gaea's Ring     => HP-Up
         10x Hyper Wrist     => Str-Up
         5x  Adamantine      => Vit-Up
         10x Royal Crown     => Mag-Up
         50x Jet Engine      => Spd-Up
         1x  Luck-J Scroll   => Luck-Up
         2x  Aegis Amulet    => Spd-Up
         10x Magic Armlet    => Spr-Up
         50x Accelerator     => Spd-Up
         5x  Rocket Engine   => Spd-Up
         1x  Monk's Code     => Str-Up
         1x  Knight's Code   => Vit-Up
         1x  Hundred Needles => Spd-Up

There are many more. As you can see, all of them require really rare
items. I think you can win a Gaea's Ring from a certain boss (can't
remember which one, I have one in my inventory) that can be made into
am HP-Up. Most of them can be made from Eden's GFAbl Med-RF, like
this:
         10x  Giant's Ring    => Gaea's Ring
         10x  Power Wrist     => Hyper Wrist
         10x  Orihalcon       => Adamantine
         10x  Force Armlet    => Magic Armlet
         10x  Hypno Crown     => Royal Crown
         10x  Accelerator     => Rocket Engine
         100x Lightweights    => Rocket Engine
         100x Cactuar Thorn   => Hundred Needle

Most of these ingredients can be bought from Esthar Pet Shop although
it's 15000 Gil a pop, and you'll need 100 of them to make ONE
Source!!! Very expensive! I've saved up all my money for 80 hours and
all I could afford was ONE Source!!! You can win some of these items
from enemies occasionally (I think the Behemoths may drop Power
Wrists on rare occasions.) Anyhow, thanks to the readers, you can use
an easy trick to get all the money you want!

=====================================================================

With the easy cash trick above, you can make as many Sources as you
want, however, there are still 2 problems. The first one is that it's
still quite a slow process since they cost way too much already in
the first place! You need 1,500,000 Gil to make a single Str-Up, so
you need to do the trick about 5 times for each Source, and it can
get really confusing after a while. (I remember how I bought 100
Giant's Rings then didn't know what I did but I lost them all!)

The other problem is that you can only refine HP, Str, Mag and Spr-
Ups from this method. Vit-Ups CAN be made by turning Vit-J Scrolls
(bought in Timber Pet Shop) into Orihalcons, then into Adamantines
and then finally into Vit-Ups. The rarer Spd and Luck-Ups requires
extremely rare NON-store bought items (ie, Accelerators) so they
cannot be refined no matter how much money you have. (At least none
that I know of. Although there is a possibility that some of the
ingredients needed might able to be refined from another Menu Ability
with store bought items.)

You can steal a Luck-J Scroll from Odin and find another from doing
the Lake Obel quest, but I'd rather let one of my GF learn Luck-J.
Anyway, I can see one item that's (in theory) reasonably easy to
earn, that is the Adamantines. Get into a fight with the Adamantoises
(they come in 2s I think) and defeating them will net you 2 of them!
(You may need high level Adamantoises or I was just very lucky.)

3) Eating enemies
Thanks to Happy Matt for this one. It was quite a long time ago when
he told me that Eden's Devour command can be used to raise your
stats. Ok, finally got the list, thanks to Happy Matt and FeralNoa.
         Ruby Dragon -> Max HP+10
         T-Rexaur    -> Strength+1
         Adamantoise -> Vitality+1
         Behemoth    -> Magic+1
         Malboro     -> Spirit+1

NEW! Thanks to all who sent me a feedback on Devour, now it is
possible to Devour an enemy easily. Like the Card command, the lower
the enemy's HP, the higher the success rate. (Thanks to Joe Pirozzo,
Eekeric@aol.com and about a million other people, actually, more like
a multiple of a million.)

However, that's still only half of the story, as the HP of the
character who's trying Devour the enemy will also come in play.
Basically, it works like the instant death spells from the older FFs,
but instead of comparing levels, Devour compares you and the enemy's
current HP. So, the enemy had more HP than you, you'll be put to a
disadvantage, but if your HP is higher, it becomes reasonably easy to
succeed with Devour. (~5 tries if you do it right.) Thanks to Weilun
for the explanations.

Eekeric@aol.com sent in this strategy:
Keep casting Demi with all 3 characters until it starts doing less
than 9999 damage, then revert to Diablos summon and let one character
try out the Devour command. I must admit, Demi is an extremely useful
spell here since all enemies on the good Devour list has an insane
amount of HP. Careful with Diablos though, as even though the damage
is gravity elemental, it can still kill an enemy since it works based
on an enemy's maximum HP.

One thing I'd like to point out is that the Ruby Dragons are not
worth the effort to eat, since they have some of the highest HP and
defence in the game and attacks like Meteor and Breath can drive you
nuts. Do the infinite credit trick and refine HP-Ups there is MUCH
easier!

4) Any others?


MY STATS
========
No, don't get so excited yet, it's not what you think. Anyway, it was
a while ago that "Souma" wrote in suggesting that I should put up a
section on how many battles I fought, ran away, game time and other
stats. I thought it was a great idea but never got around to do it,
so here it is, a brand new section.

I've gathered 2 sets of data, the first one is right before starting
to power up my characters. It's right after the event in disc 3 in
Sorceress Memorial after getting Rinoa back. Just take note that I
have a habit of leaving the game on when I need to fix dinner and
stuff like that, and I also spent a lot of time playing cards.

OTHER TIPS AND TRICKS
=====================
-> Magic
I think most spells are best Stocked and Junctioned, not cast since
all spells are limited. Certain spells are really common though, like
the basic elementary spells and healing ones so you can use these
without having to hold back. If you're really hungry on spells, try
refining them from the menu. The best spells like Ultima, Meteor,
Triple etc. shouldn't be cast at all, since they're much better when
junctioned and your Limit Breaks are more powerful.

I know many of you likes to cast Double/Triple on yourselves but keep
in mind that this is only one way of beating bosses, and not a very
efficient way at that. Most magic are considerably weaker than all
character's Limit Breaks and are barely stronger than a regular
attack (if you junction yourselves properly that it.) If you're one
of these types, I recommend that you try another approach since this
strategy will not work at all against later bosses, since they have
insanely high Spirit and even your best damage-dealing spell
(Ultima/Meteor) can only do so much, not to mention that they're
extremely rare and you're getting weaker with each casting.

-> Draw
This is VERY important! You should always have the Draw command
available on all characters and check every enemy you come across for
new spells. You should spend some time drawing from the bosses too,
since they tend to have really good spells. Try to get 100 of them on
at least one character if you can. Don't be afraid to draw from most
bosses since they're really not that dangerous (gosh, I was drawing
Ultimas from Ultima Weapon! 290 of them!) and you can draw Cure
spells or Life spells from most of them so you won't have much
trouble healing your characters. Against bosses with status changing
attacks, they usually have Esuna. I don't know about you guys but I'm
the greedy type who always tries to get as much as I can carry. The
better spells works nicely in your junctions and puts you ahead of
your enemies. So if you're having problems, maybe it's because you're
not drawing enough spells.

-> More on spells
Since you cannot level up, the enemy's draw collection will not
expand, which makes drawing from bosses essential to getting good
spells early. Another really good (and convenient) way of getting
spells is to refine them from the menu (thank god these never fail,
unlike SO2.) You can win items from enemies (by carding them) and
changing cards into items and get even more spell "ingredients". Menu
abilities like I Mag-RF or L Mag-RF (or in short, all of them) are
essential but thankfully, they're quite cheap to learn. Try to spend
some time trying out some all of these, as you can find some real
bargain deals! Try to look out for the items that can be bought in
stores or won easily, or can be changed into with cards. Some items
like Softs or Tents can be refined into Break and Curaga spells,
respectively, which are decent junction spells early in the game and
are quite affordable. Also, learning Quezacotl's Mid Mag-RF can turn
crap spells like Fire and Cure into fairly decent -ra spells, and
it's a great way of disposing weak spells to free up slots later in
the game.

-> Cards
I don't know about you guys but I like the card game a lot and it's
also rather important aspect of the game since many of them can be
refined into really great items! Make sure you have a look at what
cards can be turned into what items. So when you win a card game,
you'll know which cards to pick. You should pick one that you don't
have (if there's a rare card, then definitely pick that one!) or a
one that can be made into a decent item. Cards like Bite Bugs and
Funguars are essentially useless, as they can only be refined into
more crap items that plagues your inventory. Also, I do not recommend
that you refine a rare card, as it'll be lost forever. (You could if
you don't care about the cards though.) Play cards often to improve
your skill, and always look for cards that you don't have, especially
rare ones.

If you don't like the card game, you can also get a lot of decent
cards to refine into items by carding the enemies.

-> More on cards
If you're the type who plays the card games in every town, you'd
noticed that there are some rules that are just a plain pain in the
butt!!! (Random, Sudden Death etc.) Try not to keep the card rules
from spreading except for the friendly Open rule. Try abolishing
rules that you don't like. Actually, I'd rather get rid of every rule
there is except for Open. Yes, some of the rules can be a lot of fun
and strategic (ie, Random, Open, Same and Plus is a good
combination.) But you'd want to win most of the time right? All the
extra rules are interesting but all of them put you a step away from
a sure victory.

Since you'll be winning most of the time, try challenging the Queen
of Cards often, so to modify the trade rule. Diff and All are both
excellent for players who are on the winning streak or simply
mastered the game (like me) so you can gather cards more quickly.
Direct is crap though, it often makes you LOOSE rare cards so try not
let it spread. Also, certain cards will be completely impossible to
turn over if their weak sides are concealed (ie, Seifer's card placed
to the top-left slot) and therefore, impossible to win it under the
Direct rule. If you must play a Direct game, don't use rare cards
(but it's a decent rule if you want to loose a specific card.)

-> Rarer cards
Very occasionally when you card an enemy, you'd get a completely
different card! This is normal so don't freak out when your Funguar
turns into a Biggs, Wedge Card. Remember that bosses cannot be
carded? This is one way of getting your hands on the rarer boss
cards. Now if you look in the card menu, every boss card should have
2 monster names to the bottom right of the screen. This indicates
which monsters can turn into that particular boss card on rare
occasions.

-> Menu Abilities
I think Menu Abilities are some of the best skills a GF can learn,
since it opens up a huge window of possibility where you can make
almost every item and magic with them, and most of these abilities
can complement each other to turn some crap items into useful
items/spells. However it becomes a pain in the butt when you want to
get a _specific_ item/spell and don't know where to start. Well, as
I've recently discovered, you can get a *full* list of the
ingredients needed and its products from the tutorial menu, but only
when you've learnt that specific skill. Neat feature huh?

-> GF
Like magic, summoning GFs ain't crucial in the success of this game,
although they can be useful in certain situations. The GF command is
useful, however, when you want to protect a character from attacks.
Let them summon a GF and it can absorb the damage for that character
if they get hit. In the mean time, have the other character cast Cure
on them. Remember that even though the GF's HP is put over the
character's, healing spells will heal the team member rather than the
GF. Also, always make use of the Boost ability if you can.

Try not to summon GFs that often later in the game, not even Eden.
Most bosses have really powerful attacks later in the game and are
really fast. GF's HP maxes out at 9999 and cannot be healed in battle
via any convenient way. Most of them can only deal up to 9999 damage,
not to mention you had to wait a while for them to get there. The GFs
are however, useful when you just KNOW that your character is going
to get KO'd (like via Omega's 9999 damage attack) so let your
character summon the GF and it'll take the pain for you.

The most useful GF is Doom Train (IMO) and is worth the effort to
summon it in almost all battles. Cerberus is nice if you like spells,
Cactuar is nice since his attack is independent of the target's
defence while Eden is a big damage maker! Of course, try getting
their Compatibility with their master to 1000.

-> GF Management
Ah, here's an important task. You should choose an ability for the GF
to learn rather than letting them do whatever they want to. They'll
always learn the GF Abilities if you don't choose one for them, which
are among the least useful of the bunch. If a GF has the Boost
ability, then it's _usually_ a good idea to have them learn it first
since it's cheap and it's quite useful. However, you should switch to
Junction Abilities afterwards, then Character/Party. It really
depends on the GF. For example, Shiva has a bunch of useless skills,
nothing too great so let her learn Boost first, then Str or Vit-J,
since you should really boost your characters' stats with them. (And
because her other skills are not very useful.) Siren however, has a
really good Party Ability - Move-Find so you should start with that
one. As for Diablos, it's all about Character/Party Abilities, and
his Menu ones don't suck either. However, when you get to Tonberry,
you'll want his menu abilities such as Familiar and Call Shop first.
Use your own judgement. You should get all the useful abilities
before getting all the GF abilities like GFHP +10%. Check up on them
regularly to see how they're doing too.

-> Limit Break
(I prefer to call them desperation attacks or specials.)
You should try these often. They're only usable when your HP are low
(or with Aura) but keeping them alive isn't really a problem, if
junctioned spells into your Vit/Spr, you'll take very little damage
from attacks so you'll be able to stay in critical status longer. If
they're in danger then heal them, but you don't have to do it
immediately when their HP becomes critical. During bosses, you should
spend all your time Drawing spells from it then when your HP gets
low, dispatch them with your Limit Breaks. (That's why you don't
really need attack spells or GF summons all that much.)

To use Limit Breaks easily, repeatedly tap the O button to switch
between characters when your HP is low (or with Aura) and you'll
eventually get the triangle that signifies a Limit is available.

-> Quistis' Blue Magic
Anyway, you'll be evading encounters if you follow my guide, so how
are you supposed to get the items for her to her new Blue Magic?
Well, if you card an enemy, they can still drop an item. Also, if
you're keen card player like I am, you can also get those items by
using the card Mod Menu Ability. Some of them are really easy to get
your hands on, such as trading Gesper's card for a Black Hole. Some
of the better ones may require up to 10 cards! Such as 10 Behemoth's
into one Barrier or 10 Ruby Dragon's into one Inferno Fang.

-> Weapon upgrade
One thing I wanna get it straight is that you do NOT need to have
read a specific magazine that the weapon you wish to upgrade is
detailed in. Those magazines' purposes are to only indicate what
materials are needed for what weapon models. If you have all the
material a certain weapon requires, that weapon model will become
available when you enter a Junk Shop. For example, if you have 1
Adamantine, 12 Pulse Ammo and 4 Dragon Fang, you can instantly opt to
upgrade Squall's Revolver into a Lion Heart without ever touching the
first edition of Weapon Monthly. However, if you only have 11 Pulse
Ammo in your inventory instead of 12, you will not even see the Lion
Heart in the menu.

I don't recommend that you upgrade your weapon every time a better
one becomes available, since most of them differ very slightly in
power and hit rate. The only character who should modify his weapon
regularly is Squall since he gets a new move when he changes his
weapon. For all other characters it's a waste of ingredients. You
should however, upgrade their weapons when their most powerful model
is available.

-> Reviving
I always use Life instead of Full-Life since Full-Life is a rare
spell, and also, if you bring back a party member with Life or a
Phoenix Down, their status instantly becomes critical which means
they can use Limit Breaks easily. According to Jonathan Ng,
Alexander's Revive actually brings them to full HP, but since it's
free, use that one if you have it. (Actually, I prefer the Magic
command since it's much more versatile.)

-> Speed over defence
For some of the bosses, it's actually batter to have a higher Speed
than Vitality/Spirit (ie, save the slot for Spd +20% instead of Vit
+40% or something.) The reason behind this is that certain bosses
like Ultima Weapon can kill you in one hit regardless of your
HP/defence anyway, so it's pointless having a huge defence with no
speed. Most bosses of this type has powerful attacks too so if your
defence is too low, it can also be hazardous. However, if you follow
my guide, you should get decent defence levels even without Character
Ability boosts (like 190+ etc.) Also, you may want to use Quistis'
Mighty Guard that gives you every positive status imaginable. Her
White Wind and Selphie's Full Cure are also extremely useful,
especially to deal with Square's trademark, the "down to 1HP attack".
When all fails, use a Holy War (Drink).

-> Stock or Cast?
Normally, it's a good idea to Cast a drawn spell so you don't have to
use up your stock, however, keep in mind that casting a drawn spell
directly works differently than if you casted it from your stock.
There seems to be a lot of randomness involved with casting a drawn
spell, as the damage can spread over a wide range! Casting a drawn
Cure for example, with a character with Mag of 8 can heal from 30 to
500+ points of damage! So if you need stable damage/healing, stick to
the magic command with stocked spells.

Two spells have a very strange effect when cast a drawn spell, and
they are Demi and Full-Life. Demi will sometimes do less (MUCH less)
than 1/4 of the target's current HP, sometimes as low as 10%. Full-
Life will not always bring the target back to full HP, so it has the
effect of the scrub version: Life.

-> Some words on ST-Atk
ST-Atk is a great asset given by a chosen few GFs, they let you add a
deadly status ailment to your attacks. Though not all status are
effective against certain enemies, choosing the right one can mean
turning a hideously powerful monster into a harmless machine that you
can draw spells from. Remember however, a status will NOT be
inflicted if the weapon was used for a Limit Break attack (Squall's
Renzokuken for example.) Here's a recommendation of what's they best
spells to junction:
  - Sleep: My personal favourite! Works on more enemies than any of
the below and make them helpless for fairly long time, perfect for
drawing spells! Even better is that you can cast spells on them or
summon GFs without having to wake them up!
  - Drain: This acts almost like Regen, as every time you attack, you
get some HP back! You'll be immortal as long as you keep attacking!
Oh yeah, beware of undeads to, as you'll actually loose HP! This
works exceptionally well though, as the more damage you can inflict,
the more you can absorb!
  - Death: Instant death, we all like that don't we? Anyway, it's not
as good as it is in theory since many of the more powerful enemies
are immune to Instant Deaths and is useless on bosses. Works well on
weaker enemies.
  - Break: If this was FFVII, Break'd be 100 times more useful since
most of the powerful enemies can be turned to stone. However in
FFVIII, Break is as lousy as Death, works on weaker enemies only!
  - Silence: Not too shabby but many of the enemies don't cast spells
very often and many of the powerful ones are immune. Works nicely on
soldiers though. But then again, you can just summon Siren.

All other status are not as helpful. Ones like Stop or Slow may seem
extremely powerful as but keep in mind that those spells works on
almost NONE of the enemies! (Stop in particular!)

-> Arms for the poor
If you don't want to spend 100 Gil to rest at the inn, no sweat,
here's an easier (and actually more convenient) way of healing
yourselves. Put Selphie in the team and lower her HP to critical. Get
into a fight and cast Full Cure from her Slots. It will heal all your
HP and status, and since MP is absent from this FF, it means you're
as good as new!

-> Spell disposal!!
Thanks to John Calvin <jexer@hotmail.com> for this trick
It's a wonder that so many FFVIII players (including myself) didn't
discover that there was a way of discarding unwanted spells! Anyway,
what you do is go to the Magic menu and select Exchange. Highlight
the spell you wanna dispose of and press the Square button. A message
will pop up asking if you want to discard the spell. Select Yes and
voila! Gone! Neat trick huh? (Actually, selecting "Use" does the
same. Thanks to Weilun <tionghui@singnet.com.sg> for the correction.)

-> Draw Points get paid
As you've already know, Draw Points will recover after a "while". How
long is a while? It seems that (certain?) Draw Points recovers every
time you receive your SeeD salary. I may be wrong though, but
sometimes when I drew from a Draw Point and gets paid when I walk
away, it magically recovers!

Of course, certain Draw Points will not recover at all. If it turns
blue instead of white then it cannot be recovered. If it's a spell
that seems to be way too advanced for that period in the game then
it's probably non-recoverable.

-> Draw Points: Over world or under world?
The Draw Points on the field map are completely different. First off,
the field map Draw Points are spherical shaped, while the over world
Draw Points "exists" over a part of the land. (Meaning that they have
no material form.)

Also, over world Draw Points are completely invisible, even equipping
Siren's Move-Find ability won't show their whereabouts. They usually
occupy coastal areas, edges of mountains and various other "corners"
of the world, so search those places if you're keen.

Finally, the over world Draw Points are extremely inefficient because
the most number of spells you can draw from it at one time is 5
charges! (I usually get 1!!) Compare that with 15 for field map Draw
Points and 9 per round in combat (unlimited.)

-> Gravity is NOT GF-friendly
Gravity type attacks can never kill you right? Yes, but only if
you're a human. What do you mean you ask? Well, the problem lies when
a character is summoning a GF. Apparently, the game uses the
summoner's current HP and NOT the GF's, so if your character has a
very high current HP and your GF has relatively low current HP, it
can actually kill them! However, if your character has low HP while
the GF has high HP, the damage a comparable to bug bites.

-> Vitality Zero or Spirit Zero?
I guess you all have heard of the Vitality Zero status (shown in
battle by a purple tint.) Anyway, that's misleading as magic defence
(ie, Spirit) is also lowered! Try summoning Doomtrain twice in a row,
you'll notice that the damage for the second summon is significantly
raised.

-> A good combo
Try junctioning 100 Drains to your ST-Atk and equip the Darkside
command. Use it and not only will you deal 3 times the usual damage,
you'll also gain drain a huge amount of HP. I've forgotten who told
me about this though, sorry...

-> You have been deceived!
Well I'm not sure if you guys ever heard about this thing saying that
all monster's levels are determined by Squall's level. That's WRONG!!
*Gasp* Yup that right, the enemy's levels are determined by the
_average_ of your (active?) party member's levels, or so it seems,
because when I levelled up Quistis and not Squall, the enemy's levels
are a LOT higher than Squall's. This is just an estimated prediction
though so don't quote me on this, but it's a pretty good estimate I'd
have to say. (The regular deviations in enemy levels are still there
though.)

-> To draw, or not to draw
The field map Draw Points seems to have 3 states. The "empty" state
where the ball is colorless. There seems to be 2 drawable states
though, "full" and "semi-full". In its "full" state, the orb is
filled completely with vibrant purple colored stripes. The "semi-
full" state seems to have a very faint tint of purple color and less
number of stripes. Sometimes it's very hard to tell whether a Draw
Point is "empty" or "semi-full", since the purple present in "semi-
full" Draw Points is very vague.

The difference between "full" and "semi-full" Draw Point is the
number of spells you can draw. You always seem to get 2 or 3 charges
if you draw from a "semi-full" draw point, but the "full" states
gives you a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 15. The fast recovering Draw
Points (like the ones in the Shumi Village) seems to yeild "semi-
full" Draw Points more often than not.

-> Gain skills even quicker
Christian Groff <epoch@texas.net> suggested to learn certain skills
with items and not AP, which is a really good idea. Here's a list he
sent me:

Steel Pipe: SumMag +10%
Star Fragment: SumMag +20%
Energy Crystal: SumMag +30%
Samantha Soul: SumMag +40% (for Bahamut, Doomtrain and Eden)
Healing Mail: GFHP +10%
Silver Mail: GFHP +20%
Gold Mail: GFHP +30%
Diamond Armor: GFHP +40% (for Bahamut, Doomtrain and Eden)
Healing Ring: Recover (Leviathan)
Phoenix Spirit: Revive (Alexander)
Gambler Spirit: Card (Quezacotl)
Bomb Spirit: Kamikaze (Cactuar)
Knight's Code: Cover (Brothers)
Monk's Code: Counter (Carbuncle)

There are many more items out there that lets you learn new skills,
so search for them. Note however, there are no items to aid learning
Menu Abilities.

-> What to unlearn
Later in the game, it is wise to buy Amnesia Greens from the pet shop
and use them to help a GF forget an ability. All GFs can learn 22
skills at once, but you need to free up slots in order to learn new
ones with items. This is important because you need to split your GFs
six ways right before fighting Ultimecia, and you'll need enough -J
abilities for all your major attributes for all characters. So here's
my recommendation on what to forget:

  * If a GF has Elem-Defx2 or ST-Defx2, forget Elem-Def or ST-Def
won't hurt, since having multiple ones won't grant any special
effects.
  * If you always pair together certain GFs, you get forget the Item,
GF, Magic and Draw commands on one GF, since every GF has those 4
abilities.
  * When a GF's max HP is already 9999, forget a GFHP+??% probably
won't lower it by much.
  * If you never summon a GF, you might want to forget their GFHP+??%
or SumMag+??% skills.
  * You might want to delete the "Bonus" skills after you're done
with them.
  * You may want to forget any HP, Str, Vit, Mag or Spr+20% if you
have 40%, since a 40% is enough to raise the stats to max after
powering up. (You can even delete Bahamut's Str and Mag+60% since it
has +60% available.)
  * I personally don't like Elem-Atk very much so...

However, do NOT delete any Menu Abilities or other unique and
otherwise irreplacable skills, such as the Devour command or Auto-
Haste etc. Don't forget any "rare" skills either, like anything that
boosts Hit, Evade, Luck or Speed.

-> Another good combo
Thanks to Iaian Ross <hyuga_ricdeau@hotmail.com> for this trick.
This is a good use for the "useless" Zombie spells. Junction 100
Zombies to your ST-Atk and it will turn enemies into undeads.
Afterwards, any reviving method will kill them in one hit, like Life
spells, Phoenix Downs and the best of all, the Revive command ('cuz
it's free.) This is a good way of dealing really high HP/powerful
enemies like the ones on the Island Closest to Hell.

-> Perhaps the best combo of all...
It's (of course) critical status + Aura status!!! That way, your
character will have a 90% chance of executing their best Limit Breaks
(if they're random.) I've tried this on Zell when facing Omega Weapon
and all four Duels came in 12 seconds!!! (No need to say, I trashed
Omega and flushed him down the loo.)

Anyway, try this out on the other characters, you'll almost be
guarenteed to execute Lion Heart, Wishing Star, The End, Mighty Guard
that grants everyone Aura and a slow moving bar for Irvine.

More tips comin' up.


CHARACTER EVALUATION
====================
Like my previous FAQs, I'll detail each character in this section,
with their strengths, weaknesses, Limit Breaks and some other stuff.
BTW, if you were wondering about the stats my characters had, they're
in this section.

I've found out something quite interesting from this second time
through the game. The character's stats at level 100 will always be
the same! So it seems that this game uses fixed level up stats boosts
instead of random ones like in most other RPGs.

The one on the left is my "test run" score and the one on the right
is my best score, also the maximum you can get from equipping the
Bonus abilities. Note only HP, Str, Vit, Mag and Spr have the MAX
values, since all the other ones don't change. MAX HP is calculated
since I never equip HP Bonus. (Only Selphie's and Quistis' are in
right now.)

(Note all stats are of the character at level 100 with their BEST
weapon, meaning higher Str and Hit. Also, none of them are junctioned
in any way.)

---Squall Leonhart---
                      MAX
HP        4187       6977
Str        162        170         Spd       37
Vit        124        134         Luck      22
Mag        130        138         Eva        3%
Spr        117        129         Hit      255%

Comments on stats: Squall usually has the crappiest stats since
you'll be forced to use him the most in the whole game, while his
Limits are one of the best. Her gets fairly good stats if you manage
to not gain a level at all. His Str is decent and I junctioned 100
Ultimas to it for 255 Str. All his gunblades has 255 Hit rate though,
meaning his normal attacks will never miss.

Limit Break: Renzokuken
When this is used, Squall will rush to his target and slash them
anywhere from 4 to 8 times. A bar pops up at the bottom of the screen
and green "waves" will start to flow from the right to the left, each
of them represents a gunblade attack. You're supposed to pull the
trigger (ie, the R2 button) at the exact time as the wave reaches the
box near the left, and a "hit" will register, meaning that single
attack will do 1.5 times of the damage. (Very much like his normal
attack.) Otherwise you'll miss and get no damage bonus for that
single hit (and likely to screw up the timing of your next attack. I
can never get the remaining hits right when I miss the timing.)
You'll get the "Perfect" message if you timed every hit right, but it
doesn't mean anything in terms of combat.

I think each hit does about as much damage as his normal attack, or
perhaps slightly more. His Limits are dependent on Squall's Strength.
Note this is non-elemental even if you've junctioned spells into his
Elemental-Atk.

Randomly after executing the 4-8 hits, Squall may execute a finishing
blow. Note the chance of Squall executing his finishing blow will NOT
increase if you get a "Perfect" for the initial Renzokuken hits, it's
just random. Squall will start the game with his most basic finishing
blow, Rough Divide and the rest can be gained from upgrading his
gunblades. Note however, not all models of the gunblade come with a
finishing blow, just some of them.

The initial Renzokuken hits are single targeted but a couple of his
finishing blows can hit all enemies on screen.

         Gunblade model           Finishing blow
         Revolver         =>      Rough Divide
         Shear Trigger    =>      Fated Circle
         [Other models]   =>      Blasting Zone
         Lion Heart       =>      Lion Heart (aka End of Heart)

Ok, execuse me everyone, but the gunblade theory I had last time was
TOTALLY wrong! Thanks to Iaian Ross <hyuga_ricdeau@hotmail.com> who
informed me about this.

Anyway, it seems that whenever you upgrade Squall's gunblade, he'll
gain the finishers that model grants AND all the finishers blow it.
In other words, Squall does not learn the finishers but the gunblades
comes with certain finishers learned. For example, Squall upgrade his
Revolver to a Cutting Trigger (skipping the Shear Trigger), he'll be
able to use not only Rough Divide and Blasting Zone, but Fated Circle
as well, since the Cutting Trigger is more advanced than the Shear
Trigger.

Because of this, the theory of increasing the chances of executing
Lion Heart by upgrading the Revolver to a Lion Heart and thus trying
not to learn Fated Circle or Blasting Zone would not work. Sorry if
the previous theory gave anyone any trouble.

Note: Fated Circle and Blasting Zone hits all enemies, however, if
enemies are affected by Sleep prior to Renzokuken, the enemies which
Renzokuken was not targeted on but was hurt by either of the above
finishers will NOT wake up!

-Rough Divide-
This is what Squall used on Seifer in the intro FMV. Squall runs
towards his target while striking the ground, then he leaps into the
air bringing up rocks and a huge vertical shock wave damaging the
enemy. This looks pretty cool but does about twice the damage of that
of a regular Renzokuken hit. Critical happen often with this!

-Fated Circle-
Squall will leap into the air and spins around with his blade on his
way down, forming a ring shaped sonic boom-like force that cuts all
enemies, then explodes into flames. Not a very powerful move, but
stronger than a Renzokuken hit.

-Blasting Zone-
Gosh this takes ages! Squall gets surrounded by a whirlwind-like
force field as he extends his gunblade up into the air. A vertical
beam force lengthens from the blade and extends out all the way into
space, then Squall brings his blade down as strong gale hurts all
enemies. I don't like this very much as it only does slightly more
damage than Fated Circle but lower than Rough Divide, and takes ages
to animate.

-Lion Heart-
This was originally named "End of Heart" in the Japanese version
which is a much better name. Squall rushes to the enemy and uppercuts
them into the air, then leaps into the air and beats them up with 16
hits of his gunblade, ending with a flashy diagonal strike. Then the
enemy drops back to the ground.

This is the most powerful attack in the whole game. Squall executes
exactly 16 hits (thanks to Qualera) and each hit usually does 9999
damage. (Less against enemies with REALLY high defence, but the
damage never really goes below 9000 per hit.) Can kill most bosses in
one hit except Omega Weapon and the last form of the last boss. Note
there's an extra hit when the enemy drops back onto the ground
afterwards, making it a total of 17 hits!!!


---Quistis Trepe---
                      MAX
HP        3883       6643
Str        161        163         Spd       34
Vit        118        122         Luck      21
Mag        132        134         Eva        3%
Spr        121        126         Hit      107%

Comments on stats: Quistis has the worst overall stats of the group
it seems but since her Limit Breaks are some of the best, Quistis
stands out in the game as the best character, IMO. Very pretty too,
and looks a LOT like Aya! :-)

Limit Break: Blue Magic
I've always loved Blue Magic in the series. Blue Magic started all
the way back in FFV where it's the specialty of Blue Mages, since
they can only learn new spells through being hit by it, the game
balances them out by giving them the ability to use better equipment.
In FFVI, only Strago the Blue Mage can use Blue spells (Lores) and he
has a few decent ones like Grand Train, but it still made him a less
useful character. In FFVII, Blue spells were named Enemy Skills and
can be learnt by the corresponding materia. They were really useful
though, especially in the Battle Arena since they count as YELLOW
materia, not Green, so you'll still be able to use spells when your
Green materia breaks.

Anyway, Quistis's Blue Magic are a bit different since she does not
learn them by being hit as the enemy casts them like in the previous
fantasies, instead, you have to use certain items that can be won or
stolen from enemies on her. Some of her better ones are really hard
to get though (Ray Bomb, Shockwave Pulsar, White Wind etc.) Blue
spells have always worked in strange ways so even though a certain
attack is generally more powerful, another attack may do more damage
than it under certain circumstances.

There are a few great things about Quistis' Blue magic too, because
she has a great variety of them and she has one for every situation
(ie, multi-target attack, instant death, elemental, status, gravity
elemental, healing and defence!) Her spells are also extremely
dependable, and she's the ONLY character who has non-random Limit
Breaks. The disadvantage of it is that she has the least damage
potential.

Note: None of Quistis' damage dealing Blue Magic (except Gatling Gun)
can be blocked, meaning the damage cannot be halved by both Protect
and Shell. Likewise, no Blue Magic can be reflected. Also, despite
that they're enemy skills, they work NOTHING like the enemy's
version. I'll describe the differences (if any) below.

-Laser Eye-
Used by: Belhelmel has it as a counter attack
Learnt from: None, initial spell

Quistis starts the game with this. She turns away from the enemy then
release a green beam of laser from her eyes and hurts the enemy. It's
fairly weak (~200 damage at the start of the game but can get a bit
stronger.) It's cool to watch though and actually does fairly decent
damage if you power Quistis up.

I think the Belhelmels only use this as a counter attack.

-Ultra Wave-
Used by: Caterchipiller
Learnt from: Spider Web
Defeat Catachipillers nets you this, they're really common. You can
also get it from changing Catachipiller's card into it.

Quistis damages all enemies with pink spiral waves that pop out from
her body. This damages all enemies and does 300+ damage near the
start but I think Laser Eye is generally more powerful.

-Electrocute-
Used by: Cockatrice
Learnt from: Coral Fragment
I think steal/defeating Cockatrices can get you this. I got it by
trading Creeps' card for it.

Quistis released countless golden lighting bolts from her body and
fries all enemies, looks a lot like Vincent's Limit Break in FFVII.
Kinda weak if you ask me though. This is like Trine from FFVII, which
is weaker than Beta (Fire Breath) and Aqualung (Aqua Breath). I
usually don't bother with this as even against robots, her other
attacks does more damage.

-Level ? Death-
Used by: Torama, Omega Weapon (LV5 Death)
Learnt from: Cursed Spike
Steal/win from Tri-Face, or occasionally dropped by Molboros. It's
easier to trade Tri-Face's card for it since those enemies appear
later in the game.

Not a good one at all! A reaper appears and smacks the enemies with
its scythe and either kills it in one hit or has no effect. Thank god
this is the only level-something Blue spell as I hated them. This is
strange since the level multiplier can vary, from 5 to 1, depending
on Quistis and your party's condition. I used it when I was powering
up on the weaker enemies, and sometimes it works quite well. (Oh
yeah, try this on those Fastitocalons.)

The enemy's version has a fixed multiplier, ie, LV5 Death.

-Degenerator-
Used by: Gesper (??)
Learnt from: Black Hole
Win from Gespars or trade its card for it.

A large bubble surrounds the enemy and pulls it into a dimensional
portal and is never seen again. This is the second best instant death
spell in the game (next to Selphie's The End of course) as it works
on ALL normal enemies, even really powerful ones like Iron Giants,
Ruby Dragons and Behemoths. I've never seen it miss except for the
Tonberries and I don't think it works on bosses though.

Iaian Ross said that the Gespars does indeed use this attack, but
only when you drag the battle on for over 5 minutes. Also, it doesn't
really kill the affected character, but it removes them from battle
(like the Midgar Zolom's attack in FF7.)

-Aqua Breath-
Used by: Grand Mantis
Learnt from: Water Crystal
Win from Chimeras or trade 1 Fastitocalon or 5 Fastitocalon-F's card
for it.

Quistis sends streams of water bubbles at all enemies. This is a
classic Blue spell and works fairly well too. It does really good
damage than even Leviathan's Tsunami with Boost seems to be weaker!
Get this early in the game by trading cards for it and it'll be
Quistis' strongest attack for a while.

Grand Mantis' version will cause Silence as well.

-Micro Missile-
Used by: GIM52A
Learnt from: Missile
Defeat or steal from GIM52A

Quistis extends her arms forward and sends out many missiles that
comes in on the enemy. This works very different to most spells as
it's a gravity type spell, in that it will take out a portion of the
target's current HP. The effect may vary though, from 50%, 75%, 87.5%
and eventually 93.75%!!! However, the maximum damage this attack does
is 9999 versus enemies with very high HP. Note most enemies are not a
target of gravity type spells so this will score a miss on them
instead. This is certainly one of her better spells.

-Acid-
Used by: Gayla (??), Tri-Face
Learnt from: Mystery Fluid
Defeat Gaylas or trade its card for it.

Quistis turns away and a patch of sizzling liquid comes out of no
where and burns the enemy. I don't use this too often but this will
do light damage to an enemy but can also give them negative status.
However, you won't deal a status ailment to the enemy every time you
use this. I've only gotten the Poison status from this, but I assume
there are more when Quistis/party's condition worsens. I've also seen
Vitality Zero.

I don't think the enemy's version causes a status, but it's much more
damaging (about 4000+ at times!)

-Gatling Gun-
Used by: SAM08G (Actually, Quistis used this in an FMV in Disc 1)
Learnt from: Running Fire
Defeat/steal from SAM08G or Iron Giants, or trade SAM08G's card for
it.

This is like the gun Quistis used to shoot down X-ATM092 in the FMV
after the Dollet mission. The damage it does it very good and it's
non-elemental, but only targets one enemy. Sometimes it does really
crappy damage and I've just found out why. It appears that Gatling
Gun's damage is based on Quistis' Str and not Mag, I didn't junction
spells to her Str so this attack was really weak when I used it.
However, if you do junction good spells this is VERY powerful!

This is strange since it's the only Blue spell that is subject to a
barrier, Protect can halve Gatling Gun's damage.

-Fire Breath-
Used by: Ruby Dragon
Learnt from: Inferno Fang
Defeat Ruby Dragons or trade 10 of its card for it.

I've only used this once. It looks just like the Breath attack the
Ruby Dragon uses and is just as powerful. I think this is fire
elemental but the dragon's version isn't for some reason. Burns all
enemies.

This is Fire elemental while the Ruby Dragon's version is both non
elemental and physical (ie, is affected by Protect, not Shell.)

-Bad Breath-
Used by: Malboro
Learnt from: Malboro's Tentacle
Defeat/steal from Malboros or trade 4 of its card for it.

Quistis sends a breath of foul looking dark gas that sweeps all
enemies. The effect is multiple status ailments on enemies but can
vary depending on her condition. It can inflict Poison, Silence,
Stop, Blind, Sleep, Slow, Doom (Death Sentence), Petrifying, Confuse
and Berserk. Maybe Curse as well. I'm not too sure about Vitality
Zero though. I use this on annoying enemies and paralyze them so I
can draw from them.

-White Wind-
Used by: Adamantoise
Learnt from: Whisper
Steal from high level Adamantoise

Soothing wind blows out of no where and surrounds the team. This is
the second best healing spell in the game (and again, next to
Selphie's Full-Cure, which is the best) and comes really useful in
later fights, makes Quistis a very useful character. This works
differently than all its previous incarnations in that is cures the
difference between Quistis' current HP and her maximum HP. For
example, Quistis has only 1 HP left and her maximum HP is 9999, White
Wind heals 9998 to all members in your party. It does NOT cure status
ailments though, unlike it did in FFVI and FFVII.

This is different from Adamantoise's version because they can heal
about 5000+ damage when they're at FULL HEALTH!!

-Homing Laser-
Used by: Mobile Type 8, Elastoids
Learnt from: Laser Cannon
Steal from the Mobile Type 8 boss. I think you may also steal from
Elastoids for it too.

Quistis releases 3 beams of laser that homes in on the enemy. I got
this really late but I wasn't disappointed, as the Mobile Type 8 boss
has this attack but it's really weak. It can do about 7000-9999
damage (later in the game) but only works on one enemy. I like to use
this on Adel at the start of Disc 4 when you HAVE to use a single
target attack on her.

-Mighty Guard-
Used by: Iron Giant
Learnt from: Barrier
Steal/kill Behemoths or trade 10 of its card for it.

A translucent blue globe envelops each character in the team. This is
the best Final Fantasy Blue spell at it's best! The effects of this
spell will also vary. It will only put Protect and Shell on all
members at its early stages, but Regen is present when Quistis is
hurt bad, then Float and Haste are a bit rarer. The most useful
status (and rarest) is Aura, effectively giving your team defensive,
offensive and speed advantage over the enemies. You'll be using this
spell a lot later in the game, especially against bosses like Omega
and Ultima Weapon.

The Iron Giant's version will only give them Protect and Shell.

-Ray-Bomb-
Used by: X-ATM092
Learnt from: Power Generator
Steal from high level Blitz WITHOUT the Rare Item ability. REALLY
rare! (I was extremely lucky and got this on my first try, YAY!) I
heard you can pick on up in Lunatic Pandora if you did something in
Laguna's second scenario.

Steam pops up from the back of Quistis' head as she emits a laser
from her eye and sweeps it across all enemies. The ground below the
enemies turns gold and calls forth a massive explosion that sends all
foes into the air and back again.

Uhh.. This spell is really disappointing as after all the hard work
getting a Power Generator, you come to find out that it's not all
that good! The damage is only medium, about 4000-8000 on all enemies
later in the game, and is sometimes not as strong as Aqua/Fire
Breath!

-Shockwave Pulsar-
Used by: Griever
Learnt from: Dark Matter
Collect 100 Cursed Spikes and use Siren's Tool-RF Menu Ability to
make it into a Dark Matter. Siren MUST be at LV100.

All enemies gets trapped inside a white sphere where is gets lifted
into another dimension and gets hurt by a dark energy blast. This is
Quistis' best spell and one of the few attacks in the game capable to
doing 5 digit damage. Usually around 12000 but if she has really good
stats this can do well over 23,000! Ok ok, this is way less than the
200,000 or so that Squall or Zell can do at times, but it's really
dependable.


---Zell Dincht---
                      MAX
HP         4018      6778
Str         163       164         Spd       35
Vit         122       125         Luck      20
Mag         132       134         Eva        3%
Spr         116       119         Hit      103%

Comments on stats: Zell's one of the better ones. He's very strong
and gets good HP, Vitality and Strength. His Magic is also pretty
good but has low Spirit.

Limit Break: Duel
Zell uses a mixture of that of Sabin's (FFVI) Blitz and Tifa's
(FFVII) Limit Breaks. Like that of Sabin, you must press certain
buttons in a certain order to execute the move, each move has a
different combination. However, like that of Tifa, Zell can chain
together multiple martial arts attacks together, forming a long chain
of deadly combos. You're given a time limit to munch in the
combinations required for Duel and the chain combo ends either when
the timer reaches zero, or when a finishing blow is executed.

Zell's Duel has 4 different time intervals, and as his condition
worsens, his chance of getting a longer interval increases. Duel can
last around 4, 6, 9 or 12 seconds. He'll start with Punch Rush for
the 4 and 6 second version but will use Booya first if he gets the 9
or 12 second version, so don't expect the same moves to can be linked
after them.

Note however, only certain moves can link after another and certain
moves only links after a certain combination of moves (finishing
blows are one of them.) For example, Mach Kick can always link after
Dolphin Blow but Heel Drop cannot. Meteor Strike can link after
Dolphin Blow only if Mach Kick was done before Dolphin Blow. These
combinations of moves are sometimes quite confusing and I don't
recommend you memorize every single link. To help you, the game gives
you a list of the moves that can be linked after the move you're
currently executing and their combinations, but you'll take less time
if you knew which attack to do without having to look at it. Try
practice this until you have come up with a certain pattern of the
moves that you like, or try to recognize any "loops" (ie, 2 or 3
attacks that links into each other and can be repeated."

Zell's Limit Break has the highest damage potential (yes even higher
than Squall's Lion Heart finishing blow) but it all comes down to
skill - memorizing few of the critical links and a quick tapper.)
Practice makes perfect!

Zell starts the game with 4 basic attacks and 1 finishing blow. He
can learn the rest from reading Combat King magazines found
throughout the world or bought in Esthar.

-Punch Rush-
Combination: O, X

Just 3 repeated punches, nothing too special. This is also his
weakest attack but it's kinda easy to tap and links before and after
most moves.

-Booya-
Combination: Right, Left

This looks like a headbutt but it's actually a knee! (Is it?) I found
this is the easiest move to tap and does about the same damage as
Punch Rush (ie, lower than the rest of his attacks.) Links too and
from Punch Rush, thus making an easy loop that's preferred over his
more spectacular moves by experts.

-Heel Drop-
Combination: Up, Down

This looks weird as Zell lifts one of his leg up as if he's doing a
vertical split then bring it down at the enemy. I guess you can sorta
call it an Axe Kick. Slightly more damaging than the previous and the
motion is just as simple to do. The disadvantage is that few moves
links to this.

-Mach Kick-
Combination: Left, Left, O

Zell kicks the enemy with a high roundhouse. I like this move. It
does about 1.5 times as much damage than Punch Rush/Booya and isn't
all that hard to tap. It links to and from Dolphin Blow, which is the
loop that I use often.

-Dolphie Blow-
Combination: L1, R1, L1, R1
Combat King issue: 001

Like Tifa's attack from FFVII except there are 2 dolphins instead of
one, and you can see the ocean behind the enemy. Does the most damage
out of all the normal moves but requires 4 buttons to activate, but
isn't all that hard to do if you practice. (I can sometimes do this
in less time than Punch Rush, since I don't like the latter very
much.)

-Meteor Strike-
Combination: Up, O, Down, O
Combat King issue: 002

This looks just like Tifa's from FFVII, but it works differently.
Zell lifts the enemy up with one arm (gosh he's strong, but what's
even more impressive is that Tifa is as strong as Zell is!), leaps
into the air and yank them back to the ground. As hinted from the
magazine article ("...the bigger they are, the harder they fall.."),
this move is of gravity elemental. (Ok, gravity attacks ain't defined
as an element like in FFVII, but since they're used so much and are
so wonderfully useful, I might as well give them credit and their own
respective element that they deserve.) I think this does damage equal
to 75% of the target's maximum HP, but it cannot do more than 9999
damage per hit. Also, it does not work on most bosses (but I think
Mobile Type 8 is one which this attack DID work.) Against enemies
with HUGE defence and HP (Ruby Dragons, Iron Giants etc.) you'd want
to use this as often as possible, since it will do 9999 damage per
hit, very worthwhile against those enemies.

NOTE! The only enemy where this did not work on was a Behemoth

The motion is quite easy to do (despite how the magazine says this is
tricky) but won't link after many moves. Note if this attack does 0
damage, it means that the enemy is dead.

The below moves are finishers, meaning that no matter how much time
is left on the timer, Duel will end upon executing these moves. They
will show up on the screen with their names flashing and they're all
very tricky moves to do. Also, you can't just pull them right off the
air, as they require a certain combination of moves to be done in a
series before the option for a finishing blow becomes available.
Remember, the pre-requisite moves are only the simplest chains that a
finisher can be invoked! Meaning you can chain anything before the
pre-requisite moves and still trigger the finishing blow.

Note I don't know who started this whole thing about Zell must be at
a certain level to use a certain finishing blow. I was able to use
ALL of them at LEVEL 12!!! Go figure.

-Burning Rave-
Combination: Down, Down, Down, Down, Circle
Prerequisite moves: Booya, Heel Drop, Meteor Strike, Booya
                or: Punch Rush, Mach Kick, Punch Rush, Heel Drop

Zell steps back and punches the ground with his fist as it cracks and
the chasm travels to the enemy then explodes, sending the enemy high
up into the air. This is really disappointing for a finishing blow.
Does about 2 times the damage of his weak attacks and that's it! It's
not worth the effort!

-Meteor Barret-
Combination: Up, X, Down, Triangle, O
Combat King issue: 003
Prerequisite moves: Punch Rush, Dolphin Blow
                or: Booya, Meteor Strike, Dolphin Blow, Mack Kick
                or: Booya, Heel Drop, Mach Kick, Heel Drop, Booya,
                    Punch Rush, Mach Kick

Zell leaps into the air and gathers a green energy bolt in his hands.
Then he glides down followed by a trial of energy like a comet and
punches the enemy as they collide, and (supposedly) passes through
the enemy as it explodes. This looks cheap when Zell is supposed to
pierce right through the enemy, but I suppose the PlayStation's
polygon power ain't as advanced to handle such animations. (Or maybe
it's too violent but I'm hoping for the former.)

The damage isn't all that great either but I sometimes use this as a
"stylie" finisher after my combos, and I time them just right to fit
in this! (See below.)

-Different Beat-
Combination: Triangle, Square, X, O, Up
Combat King issue: 004
Prerequisite moves: Booya, Meteor Strike, Booya
                or: Booya, Heel Drop, Mach Kick, Heel Drop, Booya

Zell kicks the enemy into the air, jumps up and air-combo them with
kicks then stomps them as his legs get surrounded by pink energy.
This is probably my favourite finishing blow as it looks cool and is
very damaging.

-My Final Heaven-
Combination: Up, Right, Down, Back, Triangle
Combat King issue: 005
Prerequisite moves: Booya, Heel Drop, Meteor Strike
                or: Booya, Heel Drop, Mach Kick, Punch Rush

Zell holds his fist and sprints forward past the enemy and runs
around the globe like Superman (as if his Meteor Barret ain't
enough!) He gets back to the battle field and comes to a stop just
behind the enemy, and his momentum are released as a fiery explosion
that sends the enemy head over toes up into the air.

Looks kinda cool but does abut the same damage as Different Beat.
Alright, EdwChang@aol.com  has convinced me that this is better than
Different Beat since it targets _ALL_ enemies while Different Beat
hits just one. Uh.. not much else to say about this but you might
wanna see this at least once but I don't find this move exceptionally
useful.

Tips
  - Learn a few links to some of your favourite moves. There's
nothing wrong with referring to the screen listing all the attacks
that can be executed after the current attack, especially when you're
trying it out the first few times. You should be used to a few links
and should be able to remember the button combinations to all the
normal moves if you practice a few times. Here are some combinations
that I found useful, feel free to submit more if you like:

* Booya, Punch Rush, Booya, Punch Rush, repeat.

This is also called Armageddon Fist by some (don't know who started
it though) and it's also fairly useful. The 2 basic attacks are
simple to tap and does decent damage. The damage is around 4000 per
attack later in the game, and try junction spells to Zell's Luck
attribute as a critical can do 9999 damage! You should be able to
execute ~20 moves for the 4 seconds interval!!! What's even better
about this is that it can be accommodated easily if Zell's starting
attack changes.

* Booya, Punch Rush, Mach Kick, repeat.
or: Punch Rush, Mach Kick, Booya, repeat.

These 2 are identical the only difference is the starting move
(remember how the starting move differs depending on the time
interval you get.) This is also identical to Armageddon Fist except
Mach Kick is added. I used this to take out the X-ATM092 boss in
Dollet and it's really a killer. I like Mach Kick since it does more
damage than the basic attacks and isn't really all that hard to use.

* Punch Rush, Mach Kick, Dolphin Blow, Meteor Strike, Dolphin Blow,
           Mach Kick, Meteor Barret

I hope I got this in the correct order. Anyway, practice this and
it's PERFECT for the 4 second interval. Of course, this don't work
very well on bosses because of Meteor Strike, but this is what I used
on the enemies on the Island Closest to Hell when training Zell, and
it's a killer to the enemies there because of Meteor Strike. Also,
the Meteor Barret makes a stylie finish.

* [Starter moves], Meteor Strike, Heel Drop, Meteor Strike, Dolphin
           Blow, Meteor Strike, Heel Drop, repeat
(Thanks to Qualera for this chain combo)

This is another great combo for high HP enemies since you can use
Meteor Strike _every other turn_! Geez, imagine how long you can
toast a Ruby Dragon with this. Anyway, the [starter moves] will be
different depending whether you've gotten Booya or Punch Rush as your
first attack.
For Booya: Booya itself will lead to Meteor Strike
For Punch Rush: Try Punch Rush, Mach Kick, Dolphin Blow

  - Later in the game, you'll wanna avoid using finishing blow as
much as possible, since they take ages to do and their maximum damage
limit is still only 9999. Each normal blow can do 4000-5000 if you
have 255 Strength (and use Meltdown for more) and a critical hit nets
you an instant easy 9999.

  - Against normal enemies with high defence and HP, release Meteor
Strike as often as possible. Meteor Strike is essentially one of
Zell's best attacks as it's independent of his Strength and target's
Vitality. So even if you have very low Strength and fighting a level
100 Ruby Dragon, you can do 9999 with every blow of Meteor Strike
while your other moves takes out less than 1000.

  - There are some people who think that if you want to use a Duel
finisher, you can only execute the pre-requisite move and nothing
else. Well you are WRONG!!!!! You can execute any move as long as the
pre-requisites are done in order after those moves. There are people
who thinks that to use My Final Heaven and Different Beat, Zell must
start with Booya (and therefore, only useable in the 8 or 12 second
intervals.) That is NOT correct. You can chain a Punch Rush in front
of it or even a Booya, Punch Rush, Mach Kick in front of the pre-
requisite Booya if you want to (and if you're quick enough!)

Comments on stats: Whoa! Gosh, she's the girl with god-like stats!
Too bad that her Limits are trashy. I think she is supposed to have
good stats to offset her attacks. (If you can remember, she also has
really good starting stats when she first joins!) Her Str and Mag are
among some of the highest I've seen. She needs only 100 Meteors to
bring up Strength up to exactly 255.

Limit Break: Combine
Rinoa is the only character in the game who has 2 completely
different sets of attacks, Angelo skills and her unique Angel Wing
status.

Angelo
Angelo is Rinoa's dog who is actually really smart and can learn
various tricks to aid Rinoa in battle. I think Angelo skills were
originated from Red XIII's Limit Breaks in FFVII and a bit from
Shadow's dog, Interceptor in FFVI. Angelo skill comes in 2 types,
automatic and manual. The automatical skills can take place randomly
in battle, given that certain conditions are met, while a random
manual skills will be executed when Rinoa uses his Limit Break from
the command window in battle.

Unfortunately, most of her Angelo skills are mostly crap, and since
it's random, it can also be very weak compared to the others later in
the game. She has a couple fairly decent ones though, so you might as
well make the use of them. The damage dealing Angelo attacks are
dependent on Rinoa's Strength.

To learn new Angelo skills, you must buy or find Pet Pals magazines
from around the world. You must read them too (use it in the item
menu) then the skill's name will appear in Rinoa's status menu along
with Angelo's other skills. A full bar represents that skill has been
mastered. Select a skill that you wish to learn and walk with Rinoa
in your team and you'll eventually learn the skill. (Note some skills
like Wishing Star can take a very long time to learn.)

The below 4 skills are manual skills:

-Angelo Cannon-
Pet Pals issue: None, initial attack.

Rinoa whistles for Angelo who runs onto the screen and jumps onto
Rinoa's extended arm, then Rinoa launches him like a rocket that
hurts all enemies with a fiery explosion. Then Angelo gets a bone for
his hard work.

An ok attack I guess, since it targets all enemies but gets less
useful as the game progresses. It can do 9999 damage to all enemies
later in the game though, but that's nothing compared to what the
boys can do.

-Angelo Strike-
Pet Pals issue: 1

Angelo runs onto the screen to the enemy, grabs them somehow and
takes them into the air with him. Angelo rotates about 1080 degrees
and slams the enemy back onto the ground for big damage.

This is a lot stronger than Angelo Cannon but targets only one enemy.
The damage is quite strong though, about maybe 2000+ earlier in the
game. However, since the damage maxes out at 9999, this will actually
be WEAKER than Angelo Cannon later in the game, which can also do
9999 damage but targets all the enemies. You may want to abandon this
move so the chance that Rinoa executes one of her better ones
increases.

-Invincible Moon-
Pet Pals issue: 3

Looks a lot like Red XIII's Howling Moon if you ask me. Angelo runs
into battle, gets surrounded by silver energy waves (like a certain
Red XIII Limit Break) and jumps into the air with a silvery moon in
the sky. A curtain of translucent lights envelops all allies and they
turn transparent.

This well may possibly be Rinoa's best Angelo skill, as an invincible
character is immune to all damage and status (even positive ones) and
the effect is identical/better than a Holy War (Drink) since Holy War
and Hero has no effect on Rinoa. This skill has a fair chance of
being executed and I think the effect lasts longer as Rinoa's level
increases.

-Wishing Star-
Pet Pals issue: 6

Rinoa and Angelo runs towards the enemy and disappears while the
background turns into a colored star field. Multiple shooting stars
zooms across the screen and hurts all enemies for quite a number of
hits. If you look closer, the stars are actually Angelo!

I was really disappointed at this move when I first saw it. First,
the rate which this attack appears is EXTREMELY low (about 5% max)
and second, it wasn't as strong as I heard it was. Each hit did
around 2000 points of damage for about 10+ hits. I've heard this
attack can do 9000+ damage per hit though, but I'm not in the mood to
spend about half an hour trying to see this move again!

I saw this again and it's actually really impressive since she
actually did 8000+ damage her hit!!! Although the chance that Rinoa
will use this is really low making it rather unreliable when you
REALLY want high damaging attacks. Anyone knows how you can raise the
chance of Wishing Star appearing? I know that not learning Angelo
Strike and/or Invincible Moon is one way but that Angelo Cannon can
really get on my nerve!

One thing that I forgot is that the weaker Rinoa is, the more likely
that she uses Wishing Star. Lower her HP a lot (2 digits) and even
give her bad status (not Poison though, as it's deadly when her HP is
so low) like Silence and Darkness. Maybe if you cast Aura over it,
it'll raise the chance even more.

The 4 skills below are automatically but randomly executed when the
conditions are met.

-Angelo Rush-
Pet Pals issue: None, initial attack
Condition: Rinoa gets attacked by a physical attack

Angelo rushes across the screen at high velocity and charges into the
enemy.

This works on the same basis as Shadow's dog Interceptor's Take Down,
which is basically a counter attack. This attack sucks in many ways.
One is that it's terrible when you want to keep the enemy alive to
draw spells from or card them. This usually ruins it for you. The
damage Angelo does is no where near as much as Interceptor. So this
means one thing: Rinoa is a terrible character if you want to card
enemies.

-Angelo Recover-
Pet Pals issue: 2
Condition: Any ally in critical condition

Angelo comes onto the screen and uses an item on the ally in critical
condition and restores their HP.

I don't like this skill either. Sometimes I purposely lower an ally's
HP so they can use Limit Breaks easily but no.. Angelo comes along
and heals them. The amount healed varies, but usually a lot, I've
seen as low as 1500+ to about 6000+! Not bad if you really need
healing in a boss fight or something. Note a character who is not
Rinoa CAN receive the benefit of his skill too.

-Angelo Reverse-
Pet Pals: 4
Condition: Ally KO'd

Angelo comes into battle and uses a Phoenix Down on a fallen ally

Now this is a useful one, but it would help if it happens a little
more often. I've seen this only ONCE during my 80 hour game. What's
neat about this is when an ally is revived, their HP would be
critical and you can execute Limit Breaks easily.

-Angelo Search-
Pet Pals: 5
Condition: Don't know (Random?)

Angelo runs into the battle field, sniff the ground and begins to
dig. He then finds an item and gives it to Rinoa, then he receives a
treat for his hard work.

I haven't seen this yet as it happens rarely. I've heard that most of
the time you'll get really crappy stuff like Potions mainly, Phoenix
Downs etc. But it can also net you some really good stuff at times
though, I've heard of Force Armlets and Elixirs. Hmm, I should really
give this a try.

Thanks to FeralNoa, Qualera and Allan Mills for all the info on this
move.

Angel Wing
After the scene in space (and a terrible micro-game!), Rinoa gains a
new Limit Break. You can use this while inside Ragnarock the first
time. With this, a pair of wings appears on Rinoa's back and she gets
lifted into the air, then she comes back onto the ground like if
nothing had happened. You'll notice the effect soon though, as you'll
realise that you cannot control her any more, as she's gone berserk
in a way.

Whenever Rinoa's turn comes up, she will cast a _random_ spell on a
random enemy. The quality of the spell is really quite a mixed bag.
Rinoa will either cast a really powerful spell like Ultima or a
really sloppy status spell like Sleep, and Scan/Dispel occasionally.
What's sorta worthwhile about this is that the power of a damage-
dealing spell is increased by 5 times, WOW! (Watch out for Meteor,
it's a real killer on a single enemy. Can do upwards of 40000
damage!) However, she rarely uses one of them (about 5 crap spells
per 1 good spell) which makes Angel Wing no better than her terrible
Angelo skills.

Note that this is actually a status, which means that it will have no
effect while Rinoa is in the Invincible status (Invincible Moon.)
Rinoa is immune to Berserk, Silence and Confuse status while in Angel
Wing. Also, her spells ain't THAT random as there are certain spells
that she will never use, such as any aiding/healing/reviving spells,
and certain weaker attack spells. The power of her spells is also
dependent on Rinoa's Magic attribute.

Note! EdwChang@aol.com told me that what spell Rinoa casts is based
on the spells in her stock even though it doesn't use up a charge but
he doesn't know if having a high number of a certain spell being
stocked is going to raise the chance of that spell being cast.

Happy Matt was able to confirm this query. He told me that he used
Varly (aka Angel Wing) with Rinoa when she had absolutely no spells
stocked. The result: Rinoa can only execute regular _physical_
attacks like the Berserk without the damage bonus!

There's still much to discuss about Rinoa's Angel Wing, -Skrybe-
<skrybe@hotmail.com> have sent me the complete list on what Rinoa
will and will not cast through Angel Wing.

These spells CAN be used in Angel Wing: Aero, Berserk, Bio, Blind,
Blizzaga, Blizzara, Blizzard, Break, Confuse, Death, Demi, Dispel,
Drain, Fira, Firaga, Fire, Flare, Holy, Meltdown, Meteor, Pain,
Quake, Scan, Sleep, Slow, Stop, Thundaga, Thundara, Thunder, Tornado,
Ultima, Water, and Zombie.

These spells CAN NOT be used in Angel Wing: Aura, Cura, Curaga, Cure,
Double, Esuna, Float, Full-Life, Haste, Life, Protect, Reflect,
Regen, Shell, and Triple.

I'm sure you guys have also heard of the secret spell Apocalypse, a
spell that can only be drawn from Ultimecia. Anyway, you _can_ get
them via a GameShark, so it is possible that Rinoa will cast
Apocalypse through Angel Wing, since it's just another version of
Ultima. Haven't been able to confirm this though.

Also, Selphie's Slot spells _can_ all be obtained as stocked REGULAR
spells through a GameShark, but it is unknown if Rinoa will cast them
through Angel Wing.

Here's a tip from EdwChang@aol.com:
Simply get rid of all of Rinoa's lesser use spells that ain't being
junctioned such as all status spells and Dispel. Keep as many Holies,
Flares, Ultimas, Meteors or just whatever you feel is powerful to
raise her chance of casting a better spell in Angel Wing. Oh yeah,
don't forget to boost her Magic and Speed attributes, as it can get
pretty powerful when you get a good spell, especially Meteor, and
with a high Speed, Rinoa can cast more spells before the enemy's turn
comes up, which kinda makes up for the fact that she cannot be
controlled.

Here's what Another Gamer's strategy:
Get rid of all offensive spells except for Meteor, it'll do more
damage than Ultima. This is like a refined version of the above
strategy except the ONLY spell Rinoa will ever use is Meteor. With a
good Magic attribute and the Angel Wing status, I've seen a comet
doing up to 4000+ damage each! (And there's 10 of them!) It's much
more reliabe than hoping for Wishing Star with her Angelo skills. The
bad point of this is that you'll miss out a lot of junction
potentials of Ultima. Try this out and see what you think.


---Selphie Tilmitt---
                      MAX
HP         3680      6440

Spr         123       130         Hit      255%

Comments on stats: No too bad. She's kinda weaker physically but has
very good Magic stats. Her Speed is decent though and she's the
luckiest character in the game. Her best improvement is probably how
her best weapon has a 255% hit rate, meaning she can no longer miss
the target with her regular attacks.

Limit Break: Slots
Selphie's Slots is completely different to Setzer and Cait Sith's.
Selphie can cast any spell up to 3 times in a row. Her Slots window
will show a random spell with a random number of times that spell
will be cast. If that's not the spell you want, you may select "Do
over" which will bring up another spell. When the desired spell comes
up, you may select "cast" to cast it. These spells will not consume
Selphie's stocked spells so use them as often as you wish.

Note time does not stop as you select your spells, even with the
"Wait" option. (The Wait option sucks in this game anyway.) So
spending too long on her Slots trying to get better spells can be
dangerous.

Selphie has 4 unique spells on her Slots too, and they're all good
ones. At the beginning of the game, you may only get crap magic like
Fire but she'll likely to get better spells as her level does up.
(ie, Ultima may have about a 1% chance or less of showing up while
she's at level 10, but at level 100, Ultima comes up quite often.)

Note if a certain spell is cast multiple times, the targeting is
random and it's not very effective if you ask me! When you come up
with say a positive status spell (like Haste) cast 3 times, it never
works so that each member on your team gets a dose, which wastes the
spell. (The spell will always cast on a same member twice.)

Below are the 4 unique spells Selphie that can be cast only with her
Slots. Note none of these can be cast multiple times, since they
don't need to. When you cast one of these spells once, it will show
up in her status screen and the chance of getting that spell on her
Slots in the future will increase.

-Full Cure-
This heals all allies to full HP AND it will cure negative status
too, effectively the best healing spell in the game. Also, I'm sure
this spell will work on Invincible allies! The chance of getting this
on her Slots is very high, so you don't need to struggle when you
want healing, although Full Cure shows up less times when she's at
higher levels.

-Wall-
A stone barrier raises through the ground to guard all allies. Not a
bad defence spell but if Quistis is in your party, have her use
Mighty Guard instead. Wall will only give you Shell and Protect, but
it's pretty decent if you don't have access to Mighty Guard yet.

-Rapture-
A useful spell with a terrible translated name, which puts a pair of
wings on each enemy's back and they get lifted into the air and is
never seen again. Works well on normal enemies but certain enemies
are resistant to it (like Tonberries.)

-The End-
EVERYBODY fears this spell! Flowers will blossom before the enemies
and the background turns into a flower filled meadow and the words
"The End" pops up like if the game has ended. Then the enemies die
for no reason. What's so powerful about this is that it will even
work on really tough bosses like Omega! Very rare on her Slots, but
has a decent chance of showing up at high levels.

NOTE! I know that there are 2 extra unique spells that Selphie is
supposed to have but hasn't been put into the game due to time
constraints (I think) but are obtainable via a GameShark. If you've
seen these 2 spells then please tell me what they looked like and
what their effects are.

Finally, someone's e-mailed me about her hidden spells. Percent will
lower all target's HP to critical (which would make Devour and Card
commands ultra useful) and Catastrophe which deals a large sum of
non-elemental damage to all targets like Ultima/Apocalypse, or even
better, Selphie's version of Shockwave Pulsar!!! Thanks -Skrybe- for
the information, now only if someone can send me the description and
other stuff.

Oh yeah, you can also obtain every single unique spells from Slots as
stocked regular spells to use at your own leasure! However, no one
knows the junction potentials of these 6 great spells. C'mon guys,
get your GameSharks on and try it out! (I don't have the codes
though, but try Scott Ong's guide.)

Since time is not paused when Selphie uses her Slots, try to use it
when another character/enemy is executing a lengthy action (casting a
spell etc.) The best way to select your spell is to do it during a GF
summoning animation, if you wanna give up Boost for it that is.
Diablos is the best since his attack is lengthy and don't use Boost.

The spell to look for depends on your situation. Early on in the
game, basic elementary spells can satisfy most purposes and may
actually top Squall or Zell's Limit Breaks! Later in the game
however, her usefulness pans out since everyone else has at least one
really powerful attack or defensive skills. So Selphie is best used
as a healer with her Full Cure. Her Wall is also good if you don't
have Quistis. If you manage to get Aura then you might as well use
it. Haste is also fairly decent.

As for offence, the best Selphie can do is probably multiple Meteors
for single targets or multiple Ultimas for multiple targets. (Meteor
will actually do respectable damage when her Magic attribute is 255.)
If you manage to get The End, you can end the fight in one shot! (You

EASY SLOT JACKPOT! ==================================================
|Thanks to Matt <The200sx@aol.com> for this trick.                  |
|                                                                   |
|Have you tried to strike it lucky with Selphie's Slots but don't   |
|get any good magic? Try this trick.                                |
|                                                                   |
|Make sure that Selphie is in critical condition, or under Aura. Now|
|have another team member cast a spell (any will do, preferably a   |
|cheap one) but before the spell is executed, press the "Open"      |
|button on your PlayStation to open the lid. The game will try to   |
|load the spell off the CD but it cannot, so the game will kinda    |
|"soft" freeze. Take advantage of this time to cycle through        |
|Selphie's Slots for desirable spells, then close the lid and       |
|resume play.                                                       |
|                                                                   |
|Since the time is paused, you virtually have an eternity to cycle  |
|for your favourite spells, but this trick is not without flaws. One|
|big drawback is that the spells offered with this is quite limited.|
|If you keep cycling for ages and ages, it'll eventually "recycle"  |
|the old spells, meaning if you do not get say The End for the first|
|40 times, you will never get it. But this is still a nice trick    |
|though, enough to keep Selphie fans happy. :)                      |

---Irvine Kinneas---
                      MAX
HP         4120      6730
Str         156       157        Spd       39
Vit         108       118        Luck      21
Mag         128       129        Eva        3%
Spr         105       115        Hit      115%

Comments on stats: For some reason, Irvine seems to have really low
stats. His Str is the lowest... and all his other stats are the
lowest out of all characters. You think it's because he starts off at
the highest level? He's the fastest though.

Limit Break: Shot
Hehe, his Limit is fun. Choose a type of ammo that you've stocked in
your inventory and tap the trigger button (R1) rapidly to shoot as
many bullets as you can under a time limit. The time limit is a
depleting bar to the lower right of the screen and the amount of time
he has available can vary. Unlike Zell though, Irvine's bar does not
lengthen as his timer is expanded, instead it moves slower, so it's
not easy to identify the amount of time he has available or the
amount of it's left. It's also hard to tell how many different time
intervals Irvine has. When a shot deals zero damage, it means that
the target is dead so don't waste any more bullets. (But it sucks
since you'll always waste at least one bullet for this purpose.)

By obtaining new bullets, Irvine can expand his variety of shots.
Most of them can be bought in stores, some of them can be won or
refined from cards, and all of them can be refined from Ifrit's Ammo-
RF Menu Ability (some of the rarer bullets can only be gotten this
way.) Make sure that you browse through that ability menu often as
you can find some really good deals that you just CANNOT resist!
(Like 1 Chef's Knife into 10 AP Ammo or 1 Poison Powder into 10 Dark
Ammo!) The power of Irvine's Shot is dependent on his Str.

Since his Limit Break is not free like all the others, I don't use
his as much.

Note: One very interesting thing I've noted is that Irvine's Shot is
sorta like magic is that, it will NOT wake a target suffering from
the Sleep status. Strange indeed!

The list of different types of gun shots are listed below, sorry for
the delay, as I finally got to play with them thoroughly last night.
Also, I give the various ammunition ranks in various categories,
Power, Speed, Acquirability and the Overall Usefulness. An S is the
best while an F is the worst.

Note: A C (average) in Power is comaparable to normal attacks, while
a C in Speed indicates it can be fired about 4 times for the shortest
Shot Limit Break interval.

-Normal Shot- (Normal Ammo)
Power: C     Speed: B      Acquirability: A   Overall Usefulness: C+

This resembles Irvine's normal attack, only shot multiple times in
succession.

The cheapest ammo is actually quite efficient, it can be bought in
most stores. The speed is good and the damage is equivalent to his
normal attacks. Needless to say, if Irvine has very high Str, this
attack can be quite strong and for a low price. I use this attack the
most.

-Scatter Shot- (Shotgun Ammo)
Power: D     Speed: B      Acquirability: A   Overall Usefulness: D

Looks similar to Normal Shot but hits all enemies.

This has the same speed as Normal Shot, but it's only about half as
strong. There are not very many situations in the game where you need
to target multiple enemies at the same time so this shot is a waste.

-Dark Shot- (Dark Ammo)
Power: D-    Speed: B      Acquirability: B   Overall Usefulness: C+

Irvine shoots a granade that explodes into a green cloud.

I like this. It's the weakest ammunition there is but it has decent
speed and has a chance of giving the enemy a random negative status
per shot. I've seen Poison, Darkness, Silence and Sleep. Can also be
gotten fairly easily.

-Flame Shot- (Fire Ammo)
Power: B     Speed: C      Acquirability: B-  Overall Usefulness: C

Not quite a flamethrower but Irvine launches a burst of flame similar
to that of Opera's long ranged version of Flame Launcher in SO2.

The only elemental shot there is, so it can either be extremely
useful or completely useless. The fire elemental nature of this
attack is good against certain enemies like Malboro, as it will do
double damage. The damage done with Flame Shot unde neutral elemental
resistance is about twice that of Normal Shot.

-Canister Shot- (Demolition Ammo)
Power: B+    Speed: F      Acquirability: C   Overall Usefulness: E

Irvine blasts many rockets from his gun which homes in on the enemy.

I hate this attack. It's very strong but it's so slow that I can
bearly manage to shoot 3 times during the shortest time interval, so
Normal Ammo can hit for more damage than this most of the time (via
critical hits.) It's quite expensive but you can still find a few
bargins for Demolition Ammo if you look for Running Fires.

-Quick Shot- (Fast Ammo)
Power: E     Speed: S      Acquirability: B   Overall Usefulness: A-

Irvine fires rapid shots at an enemy, but not quite machinegun
standards.

Does about the same damage as Dark Shot but it can shoot 2-3 bullets
per 1 Normal Ammo! Since it is fired so many times, the rate of a
critical attack pops up is also the highest among all shots. The only
drawback is that the ammunition runs out faster than the rate at
which Lara Croft's boobs grows, so keep plenty of them in stock.

-Armor Shot- (AP Ammo)
Power: A+    Speed: E      Acquirability: C-  Overall Usefulness: B+

Irvine blasts a thin beam of laser which penetrates the enemy's
defence.

Probably the one of the best ammunition in the game. It's did 9999
damage when I didn't junction anything in Irvine's Str (his normal
attack was doing only 1100+ damage!) It's not too hard to get, Chef's
Knives can nets you loads of this, and they're reasonably easy to
acquire. It's slow though, and you won't even notice a critical hit,
so IMO, Fast Ammo is more useful.

-Hyper Shot- (Pulse Ammo)
Power: S+    Speed: E      Acquirability: E   Overall Usefulness: D

Irvine fires a huge beam of intense light at the enemy.

I'm not sure if this damages all enemies, but it seems so. It's
exceptionally hard to get your hands on (but it wont be much of a
problem if you use the infinite Elnoyle encounter to your advantage.)
Slow like Ammo Shot, but it almost always do 9999 damage, meaning all
critical hits will be wasted. You can shoot 3 times during the
shortest time interval, meaning doing 29997 points of damage, but
with 255 Str, Quick Shot can hit 10+ times, for ~2500 each hit, plus
critical hits, meaning there's a much greater chance of doing more
damage if you just stick to Quick Shot.


---Seifer Almasy---
Thanks to Colin Pentney <salivator@hotmail.com> who took the time to
level Seifer to level 100 and sent in the stats. The value to the
left is Seifer's at level 100 WITHOUT any bonuses, the one on the
right is the estimated maximum acquirable with the bonuses. It is
served mainly to compare with the max stats of the other characters.

                    Est. MAX
HP         5823       8553
Str          60        151       Spd       45
Vit          39        130       Luck      19
Mag          45        136       Eva        4%
Spr          38        129       Hit      255%

Comments on stats: Geez, Seifer's stats rivals even that of Rinoa's!
His Str is the lowest though, but that's because he cannot upgrade
his weapon and is stuck with a crap gunblade. (If he did, add 13
points to his Str, and he'll have standard Str.) He has the highest
Vit and Spr. Don't go away yet, look at this HP and Spd. WOW! His max
HP is about 2000 higher than most and he's even faster than Irvine!
All that plus the ability to hit with perfect precision, making him
the most powerful character in the game. Oh dear, if only you can get
him in your team permanently.

Limit Break: Fire Cross
I'm a little puzzled by the name of his Limit Breaks, I know it's
supposed to be confusing since you only get to use him for a little
while. Fire Cross seems to be the "style" of his Limits (like Rinoa's
Combine) while each attack (like No Mercy) is a separate skill in the
order of Fire Cross.

Seifer, like Squall, also uses a gunblade, but his style of attack is
completely different. Seifer seems to be able to "fuse" magic with
his "sword" attacks, forming a style of his own.

Seifer is also the strangest since he seems to have the ability to
use his Limit Breaks at will, meaning he has no problem to get the
triangle to show up indicating a Limit Break is available.

-No Mercy-
Seifer blast all enemies with a Fire spell then he spins his gunblade
and starts charging for an energy sphere. He then swings the blade,
sending a high speed spinning projectile at each enemy.

Well, at least it hits all enemies. It's only a single hit so it's
not very powerful. IMO, this acts in a very similar way to Rinoa's
Angelo Cannon, or perhaps slightly weaker. And no, this is not fire
elemental.

-Demon Slice-
Seifer again torces one opponent with a Fire spell then he spins,
forming a tornado, sucks one target into the air and slices them
repeatedly in mid air.

Well, not a playable Limit Break, but it's his special attack when
you fight him at the end of disc 2. His gunblade has the same
greenish glow as his No Mercy skill so I guess it's his new Limit
Break at that time.

-Zantetsuken Reverse-
It's sorta like Odin's attack except that there are 2 more characters
after the 3 Kanji, spelling "Reverse".

Not a playable Limit Break either, but it looks pretty cool.

-Bloodfest-
Seifer burns all targets with a Fire spell then leaps into the air
and slashes with his gunblade in the shape of a cross. A flaming
cross appears on the ground below his targets and it begins to sink,
until it finally colapses. Something like that.

Another non-playable Limit Break, Seifer uses this during the third
time you encounter him inside the Lunatic Pandora. According to
-Skrybe-, Gilgamesh will take down Seifer before he can take enough
damage to use Bloodfest, so that's why Seifer could only use regular
attacks during that fight. To see this attack, you've really have to
beat up on Seifer and make it fast, which isn't a good idea since
you'll be missing the opportunity on drawing Aura.

(Thanks to -Skrybe- for the information.)


---Edea Kramer---
Thanks to Qualera for Edea's level 100 stats.

                    Est. MAX
HP         3777       5997
Str          61        135       Spd       31
Vit          20         94       Luck      15
Mag          55        129       Eva        2%
Spr          45        121       Hit       97%

Comments on stats: Nothin' to see here. Edea is no where near as good
as Seifer and is even weaker than all normal party members, but who
can blame her? She starts at such a high level of 26. Low HP, very
low Vit and Spd but has ok Mag and Spr. The only interesting thing
about Edea is her Str. It is the highest even though she's a magic
user and uses no weapons.

Limit Break: Sorcery
Well, sorcery is everything to a sorceress, but Edea seems to be
quite limited in her sorcery skills, at least in battle. I've only
seen one sorcery skill.

-Ice Strike-
Edea gets angry and icicles start to materialize in thin air, then
she directs them at the enemy.

No this does not do ice elemental damage. It's not a bad attack
though, but don't expect too much since it still does 1 hit and only
targets one enemy.

> Any others??

| GF basics |
 -----------
-Guardian forces level up with you as long as they are equipped.
 They do not have to be used to gain experience. If you have more
 than one GF equipped on a character then the experience recieved
 will be split up into the number of the guardian forces that you
 have equipped
-Leveling up a Guardian force makes it more powerful, and increases
 its maximum HP level. When you summon a Guardian force, the amount
 it takes to show up is affected by its compatibility
-There are a couple of ways to increase compatibility, the maximum
 it can reach is 1000
1.Every time that the selected GF is used in battle, then the
  compatibility increases by 20
2.Evert time a magic of the same element is used as the GF, then
  the compatibility increases by a small amount
3.Many items that some enemies drop increase the compatibility of
  the GF that is the same element.
EXAMPLE: The cactus thorn that the Cactaur enemies on Cactaur island
increase Jumbo Cactaur's compatibility by three each time that they are
used
-GF's are very vital to your survival as only with the GF's power to
 Junction magic to your stats will you be able to survive in the wolrd
 of FF8
-Junctioning is very easy
1.After equipped the GF, back out with the Triangle button
2.You can junction magic to the stats that are highlighted in white,
  which are the junction abilities that the GF has learned
3.Different types of magic raise your stats by different amounts
  look for a junctioning section in this faq soon
-A GF can learn a maximum of 22 abilites, some items you find during
 your adventure will teach your GF's different abilities
-If you have a maximum of abilites learned and want to teach your GF
 a new move, then buy some Amnesia Greens, which are available in
 almost every store at every town
-Its pointless to keep some lower level abilites
EXAMPLE:You have an item that teaches you the ability Strength+60%, and
your GF has the Strength+20%, and Strength+40% abilites. Its best to use
amnesia greens to forget the Strength+20% ability, and teach your GF the
ability of Strength+60%
BOOST SHOULD BE LEARNED IMMEDIATELY
-It only costs 10 AP to learn, and it will power up your GF's attack
 by a significant amount.
-To use it after you learned it
1.When the attack starts, press the Select Button
2.You should see a little square symbol with a 75
3.Start pressing square until you see an X appear

 ---------------------------------
Useful Abilites: First learn all the Junction abilites so your
characters will be able to junction to more stats at once. The Card
command lets you change enemies to cards, and get some pretty rare cards
from the enemies, which can be useful if you plan to get some of the
more powerful cards later in the game, or even some of the best items
using the other useful card ability that Quezacotl provides, the Card
Mod which changes the cards that you own into really poweful items. This
is most useful near the end of the game when you get some of the more
powerful cards. The Refinement skills can also produce some good magic
from the items that you find from enemies in the field.

Useful abilities: Learn all the junction abilites early in the game so
you can improve your stats with these. The Vit+40%, and Spr+40% are also
useful for raising stats by a large amount, especially later in the
game. The refinement ability is great to change items into powerful
magic for junctioning as early as possible since it only costs 30 AP
points

 -----------------------------------
Useful abilites:Str Bonus is a must learn early in the game as it
increases your attack by one everytime that you gain a level as long as
you have it junctioned as one of your commands. Ammo-RF is a must once
you get Irvine so you can get some of his more powerful ammo for his
limit breaks.HP-J is also good for raising your Hp very early in the
game. F Mag-RF will help you defeat Diablo early in the game, so see the
walkthrough for strategies on how to beat Diablo easily early in theg
game with low levels. Mad rush is pretty useless as all it does is cast
Haste,protect, and Berserk on all your characters which can be good in
some random battles, but in tough boss battles it will be deadly because
you cannot control your characters when they have the berserk status on
them, so that means no healing magic, or items.

Useful abilites:Mag bonus is best earned early on if you want a magic
powerhouse later in the game. Its best given to Rinoa, and she'll gain
one magic power each time she gains a level. Move-Find allows you to
find hidden draw points, and save points in dungeons. Treatment is
another great ability since it cures all abnormal status for no cost.
ST-Atk-J, and St-Def-J allow you to put some status abnormalities, while
preventing yourself from getting any status abnormalities. L Mag-RF lets
you get Cure magic from stores. Get as many Tents as you can early in
the game from stores and with this RF ability you will be able to get 20
curaga which raise HP a good amount from each Tent.

Useful abilites:The main focus of Brothers is to raise a characters HP.
Hp-J allows for junctioning to HP, and should be learned quickly, and
the HP+ abilites are also very useful in raising a characters HP, and
you can easily have 9999HP in no time with these abilites. HP Bonus
raise a characters HP by 30 each time that he/she gains a level so its
very useful as long as it is learned early. Other than those ablities
most of the otehr abilites are pretty useless.

CARDS, A COMPLETE GUIDE
by Henry H. Jerng(hjerng@leland.stanford.edu)

This chapter will answer various questions on the card game, such as
questions concerning game rules and rules governing the appearance of
rare cards.  Players who want to fundamentally enjoy the world of cards
will definitely want to read this chapter.
First, there are two important pieces of advice for players new to
the card game.

1.  LEARN HOW TO GAIN CARDS
There are various ways to get your hands on cards.  You will first
want to speak to a man in front of Balamb Garden's 2nd floor elevator,
before you clear the Cave of Flames.  When you do, you will receive 7
level-1 monster cards.  Aside from this, you can increase the cards you
have by winning card games and repeated battles.

2.  USE THE SQARE BUTTON FOR CARD GAMES
Among the people you will encounter in FFVIII, there are card players
who will engage you in games of card.  When you want to enjoy a card
game with someone, make sure you have more than 5 cards and then try to
speak to him/her by pressing the square button.  Afterwards, you will be
fine by following the message and choosing your selections.

This is how the chapter is organized:

CHAPTER INDEX

SECTION 1:  I WANT TO LEARN THE CARD GAME.
      Explanations of the basic information about the card game such as
the explanation of the game's rules, the strategies so that you won't
lose, and the way rules are transmitted to an area.


SECTION 2:  I WANT TO SEE EVERY KIND OF CARDS.
     All kinds of cards are catalogued by their levels.  Starting with
the data used in the card game, you can verify how to get the card and
the items you will get from "Card Change".


SECTION 3:  I WANT TO MEET ALL THE CARD PLAYERS.
     Introduction to the card players and the various locations where
they appear.  I will describe the conditions for their appearance and
whether or not they carry rare cards.


SECTION 4:  I WANT TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION.
     It contains information about the Card Queen and the Card Club
circle (CC) that hold the key to collecting all the cards.  If you read
here, you should be able to complete your collection.



SECTION 1:  I WANT TO LEARN THE CARD GAME


 CARD GAME'S BASIC INFORMATION
In order to win at the card game, you must precisely understand its
rules. I will explain the rules in 2 stages:  1) the various rules to
the card game and 2) the way these rules are delivered.  I want you to
consult this not just because there are many who find the card game
challenging, but because a concrete process for winning is introduced.

I.  KNOW HOW TO READ THE CARDS

NUMBERS
located at the upper-left corner
This displays the card's strength in the card game.  From the
smallest (1) to the biggest (A, or 10), numbers for a total of 10 grades
are displayed on the upper-left corner of the card, all together 4
numbers.  The various numbers correspond to the 4 sides of the card:
top, bottom, left, and right.  Basically, you can consider a card strong
if there are many big numbers, and a card weak if there are many small
numbers.

ELEMENTAL  (ATTRIBUTES)
located at the upper-right corner
When elemental is added, it is essential to recognize its effects as
a part of the special rules.  There are 8 kinds of elementals, and a
card with elemental will display are corresponding mark on the upper-
right corner.  A card without an elemental mark is said to have no
attributes.	The 8 attributes are flame, thunder, wind, poison, cold,
water, earth, and holy.

ILLUSTRATION
pictorial illustration
An illustration is drawn on all cards.  Inside, a picture of
something like Guardian Force (G.F.) or player character is shown.

II.  KNOW ABOUT THE BATTLE AREA
The battle area is a field comprised of 9 squares (3 by 3 formation)
where you will place your cards.  As hands or sets, the opponent's cards
are placed left of the battle area, and your cards are placed to the
right.  Furthermore, cards of respective colors (opponent cards are in
red, and your cards are in blue) are laid one on top of another.
"Triple Triad" is written in the center of the battle area.  This is
the official name of this card game.  When elemental is added to the
special rules, elemental marks are randomly chosen and displayed on the
battle area.

III.  BASIC RULES AND PROGRESSION PROCESS

STEP 1:  Card Selection/ Decision to Play First or Play Second
After the card game started, first select 5 cards from the cards you
have to use in this round of play.  It is possible to choose the same
card multiple times.
Next, who goes first and who goes second is randomly decided.
Incidentally, the battle area has only 9 squares, and so the play-first
player will use all his/her cards on hand, while the play-second player
cannot put more than 4 cards.

STEP 2:  Placing the Cards on the Battle Area/ Turning Over Cards
When your turn comes, you will select 1 card from the cards on hand
and place it in the battle area.  At this time, if there is an opponent
card in the battle area, you may decide to place your card next to it.
Compare the numbers of the cards on the adjoining side.  If your number
is bigger, then you can make your opponent's card yours by turning it
over.  In the event there is no card to be turned over, you will place
your card in an empty space on the battle area while cosidering the
strategy for the next move.
CHECK POINT:  After your card is already placed, you cannot turn over
your opponent's card.  According to the basic rules, it is not possible
for you to turn over your opponent's card after your card is already on
the battle area.  When it becomes your turn again, if you turn over the
opponent's card, the card's color will change from red to blue.  This is
proof that the opponent card became your card.

STEP 3:  Deciding the Game/Trading Cards
When the play-first player finished placing his/her 5th card, the
game is settled by determining whether there are more red or blue cards.
Furthermore, the one card that stayed in the play-second player's hand
is not forgotten in the calculation of the game's outcome.  After the
game id decided, you can trade cards by following the trade rules.

IV.  HOW TO WIN WHILE FOLLOWING THE BASIC RULES

TACTICS #1:  REMEMBER THE TYPES AND ROLES OF CARDS

In the basic rules introduced previously, because a simple numerical
face-off is carried out, it is not difficult to win if you prepare cards
with numbers bigger than the ones the opponent uses.  However, even with
strong cards, your cards can be turned over by a weak opponent card if
you make an error in positioning your card.  To avoid that, you must
know how to make the most of your cards.
Here, I will divide the cards into 4 types, depending on the
arrangement of numbers:  Average type, One-direction type, Up-down/left-
right type, and Diagonal type.  And I will explain how to use the
various types.  When you have cards of the same type, it will be good to
try to advance the play while considering the methods discussed below.

Types of Card

1.  AVERAGE
     This is a type where there is no big difference between the
up/down/left/right numbers.  This type is often seen with cards with low
card levels such as Mesmorize and Triface.  These cards nearly always
have only numbers about 3 to 5 on every side.  With reason, if you
follow the basic rules in which the size of number determine win or
lose, these are cards totally lacking in usefulness, and they are ones
you do not want to use if at all possible.  However, if you are carrying
only a few cards, this is certainly a situation where you don't have
much of a choice.  Therefore, I want to recommend a strategy explained
below.  If you practice this, it seems you can always defend cards.

Example:  Turning Over Your Own Card after It Is Taken
1.  Expose just two sides that have small numbers.
2.  If the opponent turns over your card.
3.  Take back the first card with a strong second card.  Now the weak
side is protected by a strong card.
4.  This way, there is no way to turn over the card placed in the
beginning.


2.  ONE-DIRECTION
     This is the type where, among the 4 sides, the number of just one
side sticks out as big.  Cards such as Grat and Double Hugger are good
examples of this.  This type of card, while it is low in level, has an
appeal that it can resist a hight level card.  However, the numbers of
the 3 weak sides are extremely small and are its weak point.  Therefore,
when you use it, you must try to not stick out its weak parts by using
the boarders of the battle area and other cards already placed.  Still,
depending on the situation, you must be on guard for a daring strategy
that will turn over opponent cards.

Example 1:  Place it between cards already placed on battle area,
exposing only the strong side.
Example 2:  Use the strong side to turn over a strong opponent card.  If
your card is turned over because of its weak sides, you can get it back
by using another weak side.


3.  UP-DOWN/LEFT-RIGHT
     This type of card has large numbers arranged on two sides, either
top-and-bottom or left-and-right.  Good examples are those of Rubrum
Dragon and Shumelke.  The two sides not occupied by the large numbers
are usually filled with extremely small numbers.  The basic method here
is to protect the weak sides by siding them with other cards- on one
side you turn over an opponent card, while on the other you solidify
your defense.  Again, you can turn over 2 opponent cards at once without
considering defense, and then establish superiority in the number of
cards.  There are few opportunity for the play-seond player to recover
from this pattern, and if successful the opponent usually cannot
recover.

Example 1:  When attacking, make sure to hold protection.
Example 2:  Turn over two cards at the same time, so you will still be
ahead even if you lose your card.


4.  DIAGONAL
     In this type, large numbers are arranged on 2 sides that
respectively diagonal from each other, such as right-and-top or left-
and-bottom.  Cards like Morball and Teamat are good examples.  This type
should only be placed so that the weak 2 sides do not stick out, and you
can provide protection using other neighboring card without a follow-up
card.  You can probably say it is a card that is very easy to use.
     Incidentally, with an opponent who will not use any card below
level 5, you do not have to worry about being turned over with a card
with 2 sides with 7 and above.  For an opponent who will not use any
card below level 7, use card with 8 and above.


NOTE:  CHANGE THE WAY YOU WIN DEPENDING ON THE TRADE RULE.  When you
start to win in the card game to some extent, keep an eye on how to win
depending on the trade rules.  When it is 'One' and 'Full', it is better
to make it your goal to have more cards than your opponent at the end.
When it is 'Direct', it becomes important which strong card was forced
to be turned over by a weak card.  With 'Difference', you can get many
cards at once if you win by a wide margin against the opponent.

TACTICS #2:  DEVELOP A PATTERN FOR WINNING

	Here, using specific cards, I will introduce you to an example of
pattern that can take victory.  However, if you do not have the cards
described here, try this using the same types of cards.  Still, this
strategy has two prerequisites:  1) You are the play-first player, and
2) The opponent is using only cards below level 7.  (Sorry, but I do not
have a diagram to show.)

Cards in use:
Jabo Tender (diagonal type)
Ifrit (diagonal type)
Diablos (diagonal type)
Oil Shipper (left-right type)
Kid Morguri (up-down type)

Move #1:  Watch the situation by fortifying defense with the diagonal
type (You:  place diagonal card in a corner to protect the weak sides).
Move #2:  The opponent takes another corner, but meantime just ignore
it.
Move #3:  Establish base at another corner with another diagonal card,
thus establishing a good pace.
Move #4:  The opponent too cannot attack, but there is still room on
hand.
Move #5:  By securing another corner, it will be easier to place the
remaining cards.  (third diagonal card)
Move #6:  The opponent provides a lure.  Do not pay attention to this.
Move #7:  Here too, spread your defense and do not allow an opening for
attack.
Move #8:  The opponent, without sticking out his hand, has no chance but
defend.
Move #9:  With the final card placed (between two of your own cards and
thus protecting the two weak sides of the up-down type card)  , you win
by turning over just one card.

NOTE:  ARRANGING A PATTERN FOR WINNING.  If you look at the sequence of
the moves above, you will understand that in this strategy you are
spreading your defense except for the final move.  It is a good point
that there is no opportunity for your cards to be turned over by the
opponent, and to some extent you can make this a pattern and advance
your hand.  Now that you do not need to adapt to circumstances, there is
no problem with using this strategy over and over again.
However, with this strategy, if you become the play-second player,
you will not be able to attack with your final card.  Furthermore, when
you become the play-second player, it is better to not attack
unreasonably and play for a draw (a tie).  If you want to attack even
with being the play-second, in order to follow the smaller hand, it
becomes necessary to use a technique in which you place a card without
taking it back and then turn over two cards at once.  There are hands
where you will press on with the strength of your cards, but I cannot
recommend this much because there are situations where the opponent
comes out with much stronger cards that you cannot defend against.

V.  SPECIAL RULES

'Special Rule' is a general term for rules added to the basic rules
when you satisfied specific conditions.  Special rules are essential for
adding various accents to the card game's gameplay, and it can provide
enjoyment in considering deep strategy, something that cannot be
experienced with the basic rules.  Here, I will try to explain all 7
types of special rules so that they are easy to understand.

Special Rules

SPECIAL RULE #1:  OPEN
     You can play in a situation where you can see the contents of the
opponent's hand.  You will find this useful because it is easier to
build a strategy, but when this rule is added, your opponent (computer)
can also see your hand and will place its cards after first reading that
information.


SPECIAL RULE #2:  SUDDEN DEATH
     Even when it becomes a draw, you will continue the game any number
of times until a conclusion is reached.  However, for the play in the
second round and thereafter, you are adviced that 1) it is decided that
you will use the cards that have your color at the time of the draw, and
2) everytime there is a draw, the play-first and play-second order is
switched.  When victory or defeat is decidec, the cards will return to
the initial situation, and then a trade will proceed.


SPECIAL RULE #3:  RANDOM HAND
     5 cards are randomly chosen from among all the cards you have, and
it is decided that you will play with these cards.  (In the case that
you have multiples of the same card, it is possible that two of the same
card are chosen.)  Because you will be frequently unable to use a
strategy, it can be seriously said that this is the most troublesome
among the special rules.  As a counter-measure against this rule, you
can use methods- by using the delivery rules for special rules, you can
make that rule out of fashion.  Alternatively, you can change all the
cards other than the ones you want to use into items by using the
ability 'Card Change'.
     For all that, if you continue to play with this rule, you are sure
to improve your card game ability.


SPECIAL RULE #4:  SAME
     In the case that, when you placed your card, the numbers on two or
more sides are the same as those from adjacent cards, you have succeeded
at 'Same'.  This way, you can turn all the opponent cards that have the
same number.  If you use this, it is possible to turn over strong cards
that you cannot win by their numbers.  Furthermore, you will want to
play without giving up until the very end because a situation can cause
a big change from a disadvantage situation by chain reaction.
    HOW  TO HAVE A KNACK FOR MAKING 'SAME' SUCCESSFUL:  When you select
cards for your hand, you will choose a combination of cards so that you
can make 'Same' occur with just your own cards.  And, you will place
your cards to try to make a situation so that 'Same' can succeed with
just your cards (in actuality, you will not establish it with just your
own cards).  In addition, if the opponent over turns over one of these
cards, you can establish 'Same' right afterwards.


SPECIAL RULE #5:  PLUS
     'Plus' forms in the event that, when you placed your card next to
an opponent card, the sum of the adjoining number from two or more sides
are the same.  You will turn over all opponent cards where the sums of
the numbers were the same.  At this time, even if they are adjacent, you
cannot turn over an opponent card if the sum of the numbers is not the
same.  (There are occasions when you are allowed to because your card
number is bigger.)  Because it is different from 'Same' in that it is
better to look at the sum of the two sides, despite a difference in the
size of number, 'Plus' has the advantage that it is easier to form.


SPECIAL RULE #6:  WALL SAME
     It is a modified version of 'Same' where you regard the battle area
border as A.  The side of placed card with an 'A' is adjacent to the
border, and one of the remaining sides has 'Same' with an adjoining
card.  You will turn over all opponent cards that has the same number,
and you will cause a chain the same as 'Same'.  Incidentally, 'Wall
Same' does not exhibit its effects if the rule of 'Same' is added at the
same time.


SPECIAL RULE #7:  ELEMENTAL
     When 'Elemental' is added to the special rules, right after you
ended card selection, the mark of elemental randomly chosen is displayed
on some squares in the battle area.  If you place a card with the same
mark as the square, the numerical values (on all 4 sides) of the placed
card will all increase by 1, respectively.  On the other hand, if you
placed a card with a different mark or a card with no attribute, the
numerical value on all 4 sides will decrease by 1.  The changed values
will not return to normal until the game ends.
     NOTE:  THE INFLUENCE OF ELEMENTAL ON 'SAME' AND 'PLUS'.  In the
case you are after 'Same' and 'Plus' against a card that has changed
numbers because of elemental, which value is better to see, before or
after the adjustment?
     The answer is before the adjustment.  After all, it is because it
is better to aim for 'Same' and 'Plus' seeing just the numbers that the
card has from the start.  When there is an elemental mark at the place
where you place your card, remember that 'Same' and 'Plus' is determined
according to the value before adjustment.


ABOUT CHAINS:  A card that is turned over when 'Same', 'Plus', or 'Wall
Same' was formed is handled like a newly placed card.  This card can
turn over adjacent cards if the number of the side in contact is bigger.
In this way, the occurrence where turned over cards further turns over
neighboring cards is called a 'Chain'.
Incidentally, in case Elemental is added to special rules, and the
card is under its influence, the decision of a 'Chain' proceeds with the
numercial value after adjustment.

THE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF SPECIAL RULES

The following describes the starting special rules for every area.
Area Name       Place Where Rule Applies        Initial Rule
------------------------------------------------------------
Balamb Area     Balamb, Balamb Garden	      Open
Galbadia Area   Timber, Galbadia Garden, Dering Same
                City, Galbadia Area D Camp	
Dollet Area     Dollet                          Random Hand, Elemental
Trabia Area     Trabia Garden, Shumi Village	Plus, Random Hand
Centra Area     Winhill, Edea's Home,           Same, Plus, Random Hand
                Chocobo Forest
F.H. Area       F. H. (Fisherman Horizon)       Sudden Death, Elemental
Esthar Area     Esthar                          Wall Same, Elemental
Space Area      Luna Side Base, Luna Gate       All Rules

Places where you can enjoy card games can be classified into 8 areas
like in the table above.  The reasons behind the grouping are 1) the
initial rules installed in each area, and 2) the card player from each
area proceeds the play depending on the rules.
	However, there are exceptions.  "Traveler from F. H." who is in
Galbadia uses F. H.'s rule, and "Exchange student from Trabia" who is in
Galbadia Garden uses Trabia area's rule.  You will want to remember this
because some card players uses rules from old, deep areas.

1.  CONDITIONS BY WHICH SPECIAL RULES ARE TRANSMITTED
	After you played a card game in some area (for convenience, we
will call that area "old area"), when you play a card game in a new area
(called "new area"), sometimes rules from the old area is introduced to
the new area, and the new area's rule is out of use.  This situation
occurs based on the flow chart described below, and if you understand
these rules, you should be able to freely control the rules.
Still, as an exception to the rule delivery system, in case where the
new area used all the special rules, in a way unrelated to the flow
chart, it is decided that a special rule (just one) will be out of use
in a probability of 4 to 1 when the play ends.

(Flow Chart for Special Rule Transmission)

Line 1:  By playing a card game in an old area, you will remember the
rules of the old area.

Line 2:  When you request a card game in a new area, there was a rule
from the old area not found in the new area.  (Yes or No)
If 'Yes':  Displays "I know a rule not from this area", followed by
"Let's play a card game."
If 'No':  Displays "Let's play a card game."

Line 3:  If 'Yes' from line 2, then you can choose to 'Play' or 'Not
play'.  If you choose 'Not play', then the conversation will end with
you still remembering the old area's rule, or forgetting the old area's
rule and remembering the new area's rule.
If you choose 'Play', then you will play with a mixture of rules from
the old and new areas.  A rule that the computer selects with a
probability of 1 out 7, and a rule not on the new area but was in the
old area are agreed (if they are not merged, this decision is repeated -
3 times)  (Agreed-  Yes or No)

Line 4:  If it is 'Yes' on agreement, then after the play, the new
agreed new rule is given to the new area, and you will remember the new
area's rule.
If it is 'No' on agreement, then the rule that is chosen by the
computer (1/7) and the rule in the new area are combined.  Again check
for agreement with the old rule (Yes or No).

Line 5:  If the answer is 'Yes', then you will again remember the new
area's rule after the play.
If the answer if 'No', then there was a random divergence, and you
will remember the old area's rule.

Line 6:  If on line 2 the answer was 'No' and you decide not to play,
the the conversation ends with you still remembering the old area's
rule, or forgetting the old area's rule and remembering the new area's
rule.
If you decide to 'Play', then the play ends with you remembering the
new area's rule.

2. METHODS THAT QUICKLY MAKE RULES TRANSMITTED
After the various rules were displayed in the game just before, even
if you choose 'Game' or 'Stop', it is decided that you have played a
card game, and you will enter a decision for special rule delivery.  In
the case that the playing the card game is getting difficult, it is
probably better that you choose to 'Stop'.

3.  METHODS TO FORGET THE OLD AREA'S RULE
	In case somehow you don't want to give the old area's rule to the
new area, after you talked with the square button, you had better choose
'No'.  If you continue until the contents of the lines ("I know rules
not found in this area") does not comes out, then you can forget the
rules from the old area.

VI.  TRADE RULES

	Trade rules are rules for the give-and-take of cards, and this
goes on after the decision of victory or defeat is resolved.  There are
4 types of trade rules:  One, Difference (Dif), Direct, and Full.  You
will want to use the optional trade rule that is fitting to your own
plan- One is the special rule for training purposes, and Full is used
for earning cards.

Trade Rule

TRADE RULE #1:  ONE
     The winner selects one card from the five that the loser used, and
he can make that card his own.  When the game starts, because all areas
use this rule, if you want to play with other trade rules, you must
change the rule.  (consult the note below on how to change the trade
rule)


TRADE RULE #2:  DIFFERENCE or DIF
     When the game is decided, you will compare the number of cards
having the respective colors, and the winner can select cards (number
determined by their difference) that he/she want to make his/her own
from the hand the loser used.  For example, if there are 6 cards with
the winner's color and 4 with the loser's color, the winner can receive
2 cards from among the 5 cards the loser used.


TRADE RULE #3:  DIRECT
     When a settlement is reached, the cards that have the respective
colors will become the cards gained by the two players.  Because you can
see the color of the words of the card's name even during play (you can
somehow verify what you held), if you discover a card you don't have, it
would be good to try to preferentially turn it over.


TRADE RULE #4:  FULL
     The winner can receive all 5 cards that the loser used.  This is an
indispensible trade rule to gaining cards.  However, if you lost to your
opponent, because all 5 cards you used will be taken, you will want to
first establish some level of strategy that can get you at least a draw
(a tie).


NOTE:  ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL CHANGE THE TRADE RULE
	In order to make the trade rule change, you must play a card game
with the Card Queen who is located some where in the world (see Card
Queen, later).  Everytime the game is played, the Queen will randomly
make the trade rule change.  When the play ends, the Queen will
introduce the trade rule that is used at that time with a probability of
3 to 1 to the area where the Queen is.  If you practice the above
procedure, it will become possible to play with trade rule other than
'One'.
Again, the trade rule is introduced to other areas with the card
successful area as the center.  The card successful area is determined
by the internal parameter called 'Degree of Success", and that system
works like this.

1.  "Success Degree = 1" is established in the area where you very first
spoke to a card player with the square button.

2.  Inside the area where the Success Degree was establishedd, everytime
you speak to a card player with the square button, the Success Degree in
increased by 1.  (The maximum value for Success Degree is 10).

3.  If you speak to a card player with the square button in an area
where the Success Degree is not established, the Success Degree in the
old area decreases by 1.

4.  When the Success Degree becomes zero, then at that time "Success
Degree = 1" is immediately established in the new area where you are in.

Incidentally, the rate that trade rule is intraduced to other areas is
not the numerical value of Success Degree, and it is decided by the play
number of card game.  Basically, the speed of introduction to other area
increases slowly for number of play between 0-15 times, and when you
pass 16 plays the speed drops.  When there are 30 plays, all area's
trade rule are tied up toward "One".  This is because 30 times is one
cycle- the trade rule repeats its expansion and decline with 30 plays.
Still, if you "speak about the popularity of world's trade rules"
with the Queen, you will come to understand the usual value of Success
Degree. (consult chart below).  Because at the end of the conversation
she will teach you which trade rule is going to be introduced and
furthermore which one will be erased, it is good to consult the times to
control the trade rules.

Standard for Determining Success Degree

Success Degree	Queen's Words
---------------------------------------
0 - 2           Trade is little, but...
3 - 5           Popular, this trade...
6 - 10          Rather popular, this trade...


The Card Queen plays with her own peculiar trade rule, and that trade
rule will change by random, going left or right on the trade rule order
by 1.

Trade Rule Order:  One <-> Difference <-> Direct <-> Full


SECTION 2:  I WANT TO SEE EVERY KIND OF CARDS.

	There are 4 types of cards.  I will not be going into the
specifics
of each card because it is something that can easily be discovered by
playing.  I will simply describe the basic classification of the cards.

Type of Card	Brief Description
-------------------------------------
Monster Card    Level 1-5 cards
                You can get them from monsters in battle.
Boss Card       Level 6-7 cards
                They are special because of the illustrations.
G. F. Card      Level 8-9 cards
                They make up part of the rare cards that you cannot
                get more than one.
Player Card     Level 10 cards
                Same as G. F. Cards- They are all rare cards.


SECTION 3:  I WANT TO MEET ALL THE CARD PLAYERS.

	To play the card game, you must have card players to compete
against.  Here, I will introduce you to the names and locations of card
players you will encounter throughout the world, all classified
according to the map.  By the way, issues concerning the Card Club
circle (CC) and Card Queen are handled in another section, and you
should consult there.

I.  THINGS YOU WILL WANT TO KNOW BEFORE PLAYING
	First, I will try to give several things that you will want to
remember before you start a card game.  Beginner players certainly
should read this.

1.  Pay Attention to the Conditions for Appearance
You will not be able to meet all the card players (as published in
the next few pages' data file) right from the start.  You should check
beforehand which conditions must be met in order to meet a card player.

2.  About Bearers of Rare Cards
The rare cards that some opponents have are things you will want to
seize as quickly as possible if you consider their useful value in
FFVIII.  However, because whether an opponent uses a rare card is
determined randomly, it is possible that, with bad luck, you cannot get
a rare card no matter how many times you play.  Because all card players
has set conditions, and some card players do not use rare cards, you
will want to re-challenge them after fulfilling the requirements that
are published under the list's remark column.

3.  Whereabouts of the Taken Cards?
Basically, you will not get back cards that were taken by an
opponent.  However, in case of rare cards above level 8, there is a
possibility that (even if it was taken) your opponent will use it in the
following play.  Therefore, you can recover it if you win that game.
When you want to verify the location of the taken rare card, choose the
item "Card" on the menu screen and try to place the cursor on the rare
card you want to verify.  When you do this, the area (and the person)
that has that card is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  A rare
card that was changed for an item with "Card Change" will have a display
"Nullified", and you will understand that you cannot get it back.
However, until the end of Disc 3, there is an exception if you clear the
Card Club circle event.

HOW TO READ THE CARD PLAYER DATA FILE

1.  Area Name-  Area name where that card player is, and the concerete
place name.
2.  Starting Rule- The special rule used on that map in the beginning.
3.  Name (Distinctive Feature)- Name of that card player.  Basically, it
conforms to the name in the game, and particularly in regard to nameless
card players, they are given a name based on some distinctive feature in
appearance and movement.
4.  Appearance Place-  The place where this card player appears.  Name
conforms to the game.  In case the appearance condition is established,
it is lined up together inside parenthesis.  Furthermore, I have also
shared the condition for a card player disappearing from the map.
5.  Remark-  Entry for that card player's appearance pattern and rare
cards that player may have.  For a card player who uses other area's
special rules, that area's name is shown.  Furthermore, for card player
whose appearance pattern is not set, it is noted as "Random".

SECTION 4:  I WANT TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION.

A GUIDE TO A COMPLETE COLLECTION
What will embellish the very end of this chapter is a collection of
top-secret information concerning cards.  I shall present to you all the
information that are key to achieving a complete collection- such as
secrets on ways to confront the Card Club circle (which can be described
as the card game's biggest event) and on Card Queen who rule the world
of cards.  Particularly, the showdown against the Card Club circle is
promised to be shocking with the true identity of the King.

I.  CONFRONTING THE CARD CLUB CIRCLE

The Card Club (CC) circle is a circle made up of card freaks from the
Balamb Garden.  If they find a particular powerful player, the 7 members
of CC will announce him/herself as a Card Club and challenge to a game.
Furthermore, in order to have a card game against a card club, you must
fulfill two conditions described below:  1) You must have completed to
the Balamb Garden internal struggle event, and 2) you will have to win
more than 15 card games inside the Balamb Garden, excluding ones in the
library, cafeteria, and classroom.

Card Clubs

CARD CLUB #1:  JACK
     Card Club member who divulges his true identity first.  He will
appear randomly in front of the whereabout panel, and then will
challenge you to a game if you speak to him.  Because he uses cards as
high as level 6, it may certainly be a hard and difficult fight if you
did not collect cards up to then.


CARD CLUB #2:  CARD MAGICIAN/ JOKER
     If you beat Jack, a boy who sells items at the training facility
will reveal his identity.  You can fight with the rest of the Club
without playing with him, but because he has the Leviathan card, you
will want to seize it early.


CARD CLUB #3:  CARD KNIGHT/ CLUB
     He is one of the 4 lords of the Card Club circle, and he will
reveal his identity if you beat Jack.  He will appear randomly in the 1F
corridor near the student dormitory.  The cards he uses are limited to
less than level 6, so his strength is not different from that of Jack.


CARD CLUB #4:  CARD PRINCESS/ DIAMOND
     One of the 4 lords of the Card Club circle (2 person team) that
will appear if you beat Club.  They are always grouped in front of the
whereabout panel.  They tend to often use level 7 cards.  If you play
with the feeling they are the same as the other CC members up to now,
you should watch out because you will meet a hard experience.


CARD CLUB #5:  CARD PRINCE/ SPADE
     As usual, Spade is someone who conversess unconcerned, but if you
beat Diamond he will reveal that he is one of the 4 lords of CC circle.
Because he often uses level 7 cards like Diamondd, it will be wise to
resist with rare cards.  Here, the man who gave you 7 cards at the
beginning of the game is Spade.


CARD CLUB #6:  CARD QUEEN/ HEART
     The final of the 4 lords of the CC circle.  If I say she is a woman
who stands on the bridge, you  will probably understand who she iss.  To
meet her, you not only have to beat Spadee, but you also have to get
past the restoration event of the Balamb Garden.  Because she has the
Carbuncle card, you should definitely confront her.


CARD CLUB #7:  CARD MASTER/ KING
     If you beat Heart, Dr. Kadowaki will tell you information about
King (speak with the square button).  Afterwards, if you sleep in
Squall's room, the King will randomly appear.  You must get the
Gilgamesh card from her.  The moment King arrives is pitch black.  If
you meet her, the CC event is over.



II. SECRETS OF THE CARD QUEEN

SECRET #1:  THE POWER CARD QUEEN HOLDS AND THE RULES GOVERNING HER
MOVEMENT
	Everytime you pay 30000 gil to the Card Queen (hereafter referred
to as "Queen"), a new rule is added to the area where the Queen is.  The
order by which the rules are added goes like this:  Open -> Same -> Plus
-> Random Hand -> Sudden Death -> Wall Same -> Elemental.  If the
relevent rule was already added to that areaa, then the next rule on the
order is added.  Furthermore, if you do a rare card trade with the
Queen, right afterwards the Queen will definitely relocate.  At this
time, right before she movess, the Queen will decidedd which area she
will be next.

Card Queen's Movement Pattern

Present Area     Area She Will Move To
------------     ---------------------
Balamb           Dollet (37.5%), Galbadia (62.5%)
Galbadia         Balamb (12.5%), Dollet (12.5%), Centra (12.5 %), F.H.
(62.5%)
Dollet           Balamb (37.5%), Galbadia (62.5%)
Trabia           Balamb (25%), Dollet (50%), Space (25%)
Centra           Galbadia (37.5%), Dollet (37.5%), F. H. (25%)
F. H.            Dollet (12.5%), Centra (25%), Esthar (62.5%)
Esthar           Dollet (12.5%), Trabia (25%), F. H. (12.5%), Space
(50%)
Space            All areas including Space (she will not say where she
is going).

* Note 1:  The number within the brackets are the probability she will
move to that area.
**Note 2:  When the Queen says, "I will go on a journey to somewhere far
away," she will move to Space.

The Whereabouts of the Card Queen in Every Area

Balamb Area     Balamb, Balamb station
Galbadia Area   Dering City, hotel front
Dollet Area     Dollet, pub 2F
Trabiaa Area    Shumi Village, hotel front
Centra Area     Winhill, hotel front
F. H. Area      F. H.
Esthar Area     Esthar, official residence lobby
Space Area      Luna Gate, concourse

SECRET #2:  AN EVENT/OCCURRENCE THAT LETS YOU GET RARE CARDS IN DOLLET
	Only in the case when the Queen is in Dollet, an item is added to
the selection bars for conversing with her.  It says, "talk about your
artist father".  If you choose this, after she talks about her father
who is an artist, the Queen will want a rare card in the order on the
chart below.  If you lose to her in a card game (and you can do this in
any area) and let her take it in a trade, her artist father will draw a
"New Rare Card".  To find out who in the world is circulating the "new
rare card", it is okay to ask the Queen about "her artist father" while
she is in Dollet.  Incidentally, the card that was taken by the Queen
was passed on to the artist's grand child in Dollet, and you can get it
back if you play a card game with him/her.

EVENT OCCURRENCE CONDITION:  AFTER YOU HANDED OVER A PREDETERMINED CARD
TO THE QUEEN IN ANY AREA, GO TALK TO THE QUEEN ON PUB 2F IN DOLLET ABOUT
"HER ARTIST FATHER".

RESCUE MEASURES FOR GETTING RARE CARDS
	If you enter Disc 4, because you cannot meet any one holding rare
cards, you may think that it is impossible to complete your collection
if you have not collected all the rare cards by this point.  However, an
event that becomes a rescue measure for this is especially prepared.
First, the Queen arrives at the escape pod retrieval site, which is
in the Abandon plains in Esthar.  If you play a card game with her, the
Queen will use rare cards that you do not have.  Incidentally, at this
time the Queen will use a combination of special rules not belonging to
any area.
Furthermore, if you completed the CC circle event before Disc 3
ended, CC circle members are regaining strength about the spaceship
Lagunarock in Disc  4.  At this point, they are not only using rare
cards you don't have (The Queen peepss in), they are using rare cards
that were destroyedd with "Card Change".  However, be aware that
Koyokoyo cards cannot be obtained by this rescue measure.
Incidentally, members of the CC circle are using rules that is
different from various areas.  Again, among CC circle comrades, just
like the transmission of rules among areas, you will be introduced to
new rules and have old ones erased.  If you want to play a card game
with the King, enter this person into your party, and you must speak
using the square button inside the spaceship Lagunarock.

IF YOU COLLECTED ALL THE CARDS..?
	If you collected all the cards, a star mark is fixed to the right
of the "Card" item on the menu screen.  Incidentally, as for card that
you got once, it doesn't matter to the fact that you completed the
collection if you had it taken or changed by using the "Card Change"
function.  Essentially, if the requirements for "getting all the cards
is fulfilled once", you will always have a star to show you've completed
the collection!!

Thanks to SDallas15@aol.com
both of who are responsible for making this creature guide entirely
This creature guide is copyright to Sdallas15@aol.com, and
Morduk@hotmail.com. I've combined these two faqs together to make this
monster list which will be updated everytime these two faq writers
update their creature guides

Here is how each monster will be setup in a table.  This will make it
much easier to read.  I put
some notes that explain some of the numbers or symbols I put so here are
the explanations.
Note 1: 4=absorbs, 3=doesn't work, 2=works well, 1=normal effect,
2+=kills instantly
Note 2: HP rounded to 100s.
