<H2>
<P>Overview of FREEgiftworld.com</P></H2>
<P>FREEgiftworld.com is an independent website owned and operated by 
FreeGiftWorld. FREEgiftworld.com provides a forum of offers from our sponsors, 
or advertisers, that are made available to you. Our sponsors are eager to 
acquire new customers for their products and services. In return for registering 
with FREEgiftworld.com and for completing offers with our sponsors, 
FREEgiftworld.com will send you a free gift for your participation. The sponsors 
cover our costs for your free gift, including any shipping and handling fees. 
All gifts are brand new and packaged in the manufacturer's original packaging. 
Our sponsors are actually rewarding you for trying their products and services. 
In order to receive your free gift from FREEgiftworld.com, you must comply with 
all terms and conditions of FREEgiftworld.com that are set out in the pages 
below, including our privacy policy.</P>
<H2>
<P>How does FREEgiftworld work?</P></H2>
<H4>Step 1 : Choose a free gift and enter your email address.</H4>
<P>You will receive a confirmation email sent to the email address you 
specified. Please verify the spelling to insure accuracy. For your protection, 
we cannot ship your free gift unless you activate your account by clicking on 
the account activation link provided in the confirmation email and following the 
activation instructions. </P>
<P>After you click on the account activation link and enter a new password, your 
account will be established. Make sure that you save your password. You will 
need this password to check on the status of your free gift. </P>
<H4>Step 2: Complete sponsor offers</H4>
<P>Sponsors cover the entire cost of your free gift, plus all the shipping &amp; 
handling fees. By "completing an offer", we mean that you take delivery of the 
product or service provided by the sponsor. For credit card offers, you must be 
approved for and activate that credit card. Activation means completing a 
balance transfer or using your new credit card for a purchase. A pop-up window 
will appear after you click on a sponsor's offer with details on how to complete 
a particular offer.</P>
<P>It takes up to 60 days after you complete an offer before our sponsor 
notifies us. Once we receive this notification, your account will be updated 
accordingly.</P>
<P>Please note: Earning some free gifts requires you to complete more than one 
sponsor offer. Each gift has a Level which indicates the required number of 
sponsor offers that you must complete:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Level 1 - Complete any 1 Sponsor Offer<BR>Level 2 - Complete any 2 
  Sponsor Offers<BR>Level 3 - Complete any 3 Sponsor Offers<BR>Level 4 - 
  Complete any 3 Sponsor Offers and 1 Premium Sponsor Offer</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Registered members can access the Level of each gift through their account at 
www.freegiftworld.com . Please note that all completed sponsor offers expire 60 
days after posting to your account. Review the Terms and Conditions for complete 
program details. </P>
<H4>Step 3: Tell us where to send your free gift</H4>
<P>Check your gift status by accessing your account through 
www.freegiftworld.com. When you have met all of the requirements to earn your 
free gift, your gift status will be marked "Approved" on the gift status screen, 
which is accessible to registered members. To receive your gift, you must click 
on the "Approved" hyperlink, confirm your shipping address, print a copy of the 
Gift Redemption Certificate, and mail the certificate, postmarked within 30 
days, to the address below: </P>
